Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Ambient Mafia t-shirts @ Thump Chill this Friday

awww...i was just kidding.  

i've been taking a break from going out - it's a healthy thing,
really.  one of the reasons is because i'm working on my new
"album" - it's all live mashups.  no camputer manipulation or
pitch shifting, just two decks and a mixer.  i'm almost done -
just need to re-do one more song.

i should have it with me on friday:  hit me up if you want a
copy.  it's all over the place - i've got d+b, bossa nova,
downtempo, and even a breaks track.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] VRR: Otherworld to be demolished

I look at it this way (as I did w/ punk) - there will ALWAYS be a core group 
of folks into the sound/scene. Sometimes the popularity will be high, 
sometimes low. You take the good with the bad. But I hardly think the 
electronic or "rave" scene is gonna die out any time soon. The drop off in 
popularity started back in 2001 already. Here we are at the close of 2005. 
Is the scene dead? No. Is it gone? No. Are there still fans? Yes. Are there 
new kids? Maybe not as many as flooded the scene in '99, but I seem to 
recall (at least on the East Coast) all the old skoolers being mad when the 
scene became commercially available to the mass consumer market, so should 
we care?? The music and scene aren't going away - they're just changing as 
EVERYTHING does.

I think the formulaic cookie-cutter approach to production is much
more detrimental to our scene's popularity among them dagnabbed
younguns (and their alleged segment) than any marketing scheme.

Pendulum put drum and bass back in the UK's Top 40 with "Slam" earlier
this year. That track owes more to Motley Crue and George Clinton than
it does to anything within d&b proper. They weren't like, gosh, how
can we get d&b into the Top 40? They just did something totally
bizarre and unexpected which seemed perfectly logical to them. (Which
is actually very typical of Australian musicians -- INXS, Men Without
Hats, etc.)

Music is like technology -- a marketing budget is a sign of a bad
product. Focus on quality, that's the only thing that matters. If your
product is the best availabe, you'll be overwhelmed by people who want
it.

By the way, I skipped this thread earlier, and I didn't see that
picture of Sameer. I have to admit I'm utterly terrified to see how
much he resembles George Will. I have to take back that stuff
endorsing him as a Presidential candidate, because those fashion
decisions are just unsupportable.

I don't see a problem with this. When you drive around a home depot
with a pickup truck and have 20 illegal immigrant day workers surround
your truck, asking for work, it gets old really quick. Thing is, is
that the government isn't really enforcing anything.

Illegal immigrants are a real problem out here. I wouldn't call it
racist whatsoever. Enter the country legally, just as my ancestors
did, and you shouldn't have a problem. I'm irish and norweigan. My
great(x4) grandfather was a mine worker. He worked hard, eventually
got his family out of jersey, and ended up being one of the founders
of rochester, minnesota.

How would you fix the problem of illegal immigrants in arizona? I'd
love to hear an outsider's solution, since ours is apparently not good
enough. Having an opinion, and having a solution are two completely
different things. Illegal immigrants are driving down the prices of
homes, costing millions in healthcare and education, and driving down
the labor costs out here to a point where it's nearly impossible to
live if you work in construction, which is the biggest job market out
here.


BTW, my girlfriend is the chief page of the arizona state senate. I'm
fully aware of the laws, and I still agree with them.

Fucking wah. Those illegals are doing work no American citizen would ever do 
for the same wage. PERIOD.

People act as if it's some huge burden on them. You wouldn't eat half the 
fruit and vegetables you eat if it weren't for them. Do you have any idea 
what prices on such stuff would be w/o illegals here in the country?

That's just ONE of many jobs they do that our primadonna citizens wouldn't 
touch with a ten foot pole.

All this crying about the ridiculous formalities over "entering the country 
legally" is a joke.

If you really wanna do something about the illegals coming in and trying to 
get work - go after the businesses that hire them. If no one hired them, 
they'd never come here. They come here 'cos they KNOW they can get hired and 
even the pittance they get here is way more than they'd get paid in Mexico.

BTW, my girlfriend is the chief page of the arizona state senate. I'm
fully aware of the laws, and I still agree with them.

No, hold on, look.

1. He was obviously in Berkeley when that photograph of him being at a
rally in Berkeley was taken.

2. I wandered through Arizona for a bit. I didn't suddenly start
buying shoulderpads.

3. Arizona, esp. Phoenix, has a reasonably healthy scene. I love
Swell, and Swell was located in Tempe for a while.

4. To be fair, though, it is kind of a police state. They actually
have a sign on the California border that says, "Welcome To Arizona.
Watch Your Language."

5. Chicks in Arizona are unbelievably hot (much like the sun in
Arizona). If I were half the lecher people think I am, I'd have been
in paradise.

6. Oh yeah, we were talking about Sameer. wtf?

7. Rich people should own clothes that fit. Everybody should own
clothes that fit, or go naked, but poor people at least have an
excuse. wtf?

8. We may have lost one of our own to the Bark Side. This could be a sad th=
ing.

9. Whoops, shit, I meant the Dark Side.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sameer wtf

I'm against illegal immigration. It's a system for bypassing the law
and creating an entire millions-plus population of second-class
citizens.

Think about it. They pay taxes, but they can't vote. Despite all the
best intentions of the Consitution and all the rest of it, today we
live in a society filled with people who pay taxes and can't vote.
That would be taxation without representation, wouldn't it?

Additionally, if you're a Latino trying to cross the Mexican-American
border, you're facing serious dangers. Down in Ciudad Juarez, a town
just over the Mexican border with Texas, the rate of murder and rape
is unbelievable. If you want to get the shudders sometime, google
"ciudad juarez femicide rape child prostitution."

However, most people against illegal immigration are for tightening
borders. That's just fighting the inevitable. Even if it wasn't
primarily motivated by racism and xenophobia, it'd still be pushing a
boulder uphill.

The borders should be loose, but the people hiring illegals and paying
them half the going rate for the work, they're the ones who should be
arrested. Their whole profit model depends on a persistent underclass
of second-class citizens. It isn't just exploitative and wrong, it
also undermines the foundations of American society.

d00d, we're three years away from the 20th anniversary of the acid
house Summer of Love. drum & bass is in the top 40 in the UK.
turntables outsell guitars, some years. you get minor fluctuations in
the scene's popularity, but it won't be disappearing overnight. if
anything, the minor fluctuations are good, because the dips in
popularity shake out the trendies, and the peaks reward the hardcore.

d00d, we're three years away from the 20th anniversary of the acid
house Summer of Love. drum & bass is in the top 40 in the UK.
turntables outsell guitars, some years. you get minor fluctuations in
the scene's popularity, but it won't be disappearing overnight. if
anything, the minor fluctuations are good, because the dips in
popularity shake out the trendies, and the peaks reward the hardcore.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Looking for some opinions on Neil Landstrumm doing a
 live PA for NYE...


NEIL LANDSTRUMM CAN HAVE MY BABIES.

Saw him at Mad (Bahia Cabana) in like 96 I think, with Tobias Schmidt and 
it was THE FRIKKING BOMB.  Can't vouch for if he is still any good but I'd 
*so* go.  I've seen MBM / Advent / Autechre / Surgeon whathaveyou, I've 
seen everybody and their mom and he still ranks in the top 5 live pas I've 
ever seen.

You should also book me, I'll play live or DJ.  I'm like, the 1929472nd 
ranked DJ in the Bay Area and can mix better than some people who get 
booked more.  I also play MY OWN FUCKING MUSIC when I play live unlike 
some folks.  Just ask any of my glossy eyed cronie army.  And Ed 
Colmar likes me, that's about as legit as it gets.  Doot doot!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sameer wtf

Not true.

My dad puts signs up for a living. He's out in the heat during the
summer time for up to 12 hours a day. Previous to that job, he was
installing air filters for business in the area. He's used to doing
shit jobs.

Hell, when I first moved out here, I was a cable guy. Installing
outlets in people's walls when the attic is 160 degrees by 10am with
all the fucking asbestos and shitty insulation, dust, and spiders is
GRATE! Same thing goes with digging 200-foot trenches to bury a line
that you're only getting paid 6 bucks to install (since it was
piecework).

YOU might not be doing these jobs, but I know of a lot of people that
do. It might not affect you, but it definitely affects my family and a
lot of my friends.

I mean, of course outsourcing isn't bad either. They can do the job
for cheaper, so it's good for you in IT, right? I mean, you're saving
the company basket loads of money by giving the job to someone who can
do the job cheaper. Doesn't matter that it might potentially put you
or your friends out of business, because it's jobs that americans
wouldn't want to do anyhow, right?

Yeah, right.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sameer wtf

Illegals don't do sign installs or lay cable - c'mon now. Most people 
working for the cable company are getting paid FAR more than some guy 
picking lettuce out in a field.

You're comparing apples to steaks here.

And yet again - it's not the fault of the illegals. It's the fault of the 
people that hire them becuase they're not willing to pay someone REAL wages. 
And then let's move further up the food chain - because most farmers aren't 
rich people, and no longer get the government subsidies and such they once 
got, so in order to stay alive, they HAVE to hire cheap labor.

And who's in charge again?

Your precious, piece of shit REPUBLICANS. Not that I think Dem's would do 
anything better for the country mind you....but as long as the Rep's are in 
charge, the blame lies on them.

Not true.

My dad puts signs up for a living. He's out in the heat during the
summer time for up to 12 hours a day. Previous to that job, he was
installing air filters for business in the area. He's used to doing
shit jobs.

Hell, when I first moved out here, I was a cable guy. Installing
outlets in people's walls when the attic is 160 degrees by 10am with
all the fucking asbestos and shitty insulation, dust, and spiders is
GRATE! Same thing goes with digging 200-foot trenches to bury a line

piecework).

YOU might not be doing these jobs, but I know of a lot of people that

Andy, whatever. realistically you're assessing the output with your
ears or you're just filling those ears with the sound of your own
voice. you can do anything you want with your laptop on stage, play
Solitaire, look at porn, IM your mother and ask her how she's been,
who gives a shit? the speakers and the crowd are the only sources of
meaningful output.

also, about getting fucked by a large barnyard animal: don't knock it
til you've tried it.

also, this is just technical, but all that stuff somebody else was
saying about beat-matching hip-hop with hardcore? technically that
**is** something you can achieve with vinyl. I've done it just to
irritate my neighbors. the Vestax PDX2000s can do plus or minus sixty
percent. I'm not saying it's a good idea, I'm just saying that even
within the context of a vinyl-only set, it is still a technical
possibility.

anyway back to needling Andy:

> like the intimacy of a producer playing live, except it's not their work.
> More and more, sets are more polished, and less a form of communication

mmm, ok, but what's that got to do with Live? you've never seen people
doing that the old-school way? I have. I've seen it done with vinyl,
and I've seen it done with traditional instruments too, for that
matter. one way or another, if you're asleep at the wheel, you're
going to crash.

just to play devil's advocate, screw making it yours. first make it
**good**. then make it yours. that's the downside with the ease-of-use
with all this crap. back when it was like fucking rocket science, you
wouldn't get people being like, look, I made a beat, hooray for me!
but with the massively reduced learning curve, everybody and their
mama can make some crap without even breaking a sweat. but it's like,
look at authors, look at novels. anybody in the world can string words
together, how many people write sentences that are worth reading, let
alone remembering or quoting to somebody else? minimal creation
overhead doesn't mean an increased volume of masterpieces. I'd rather
hear somebody play somebody else's music well, rather than playing
their own badly. take the time to get it right.

anyhoo!

Live vs. Traktor? for live performance, I still say MPC, or
traditional instruments. if you can't put your body in it, you can't
synchronize with the crowd's physical response, and if you can't do
that, what's the point?

also, I made an absolute fool of myself with a Yamaha CS2X and a drum
machine one time, but afterwards I figured out how to get the MIDI
sync right (duh), and it sounded great. anybody who saw that dismal
fiasco is unlikely to believe me, but I think you could kick out some
incredible techno with a CS2X, an MPC, and a couple Roland V-Drums
hooked up to a sampler (hardware, software, either one).

but, if I had to take one or the other, I'd go with Live, because it's
much more powerful, and it's much better to use a subset of the
functionality of an extremely powerful tool than to be pushing a
minimally-effective tool to its limits.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ableton Live vs Traktor DJ

It's not beatmathcing hip-hop and hardcore - what you're talking about is 
just matching a half time track with a full time (?) track - like an 80 bpm 
track w/ a 160 bpm track - that's pretty easy.

I'm talking about taking stuff that could NOT be beat matched at all due to 
tempo/bpm, and using the time stretching feature to speed it up (or slow it 
down), but still retaining the original pitch of the track. Other 
programs/gear, etc. will allow this - but none quite as smooth and "true" as 
Ableton.

together, how many people write sentences that are worth reading, let
alone remembering or quoting to somebody else? minimal creation
overhead doesn't mean an increased volume of masterpieces. I'd rather
hear somebody play somebody else's music well, rather than playing
their own badly. take the time to get it right.

anyhoo!

Live vs. Traktor? for live performance, I still say MPC, or
traditional instruments. if you can't put your body in it, you can't
synchronize with the crowd's physical response, and if you can't do
that, what's the point?

also, I made an absolute fool of myself with a Yamaha CS2X and a drum
machine one time, but afterwards I figured out how to get the MIDI
sync right (duh), and it sounded great. anybody who saw that dismal
fiasco is unlikely to believe me, but I think you could kick out some
incredible techno with a CS2X, an MPC, and a couple Roland V-Drums
hooked up to a sampler (hardware, software, either one).

but, if I had to take one or the other, I'd go with Live, because it's
much more powerful, and it's much better to use a subset of the
functionality of an extremely powerful tool than to be pushing a
minimally-effective tool to its limits.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] sameer wtf

actually, the primary reason the Republicans are so up on this huge
wacko religious agenda these days is because the Democrats abandoned
the working class during the Clinton era. the working class really got
fucked by both parties, and huge swathes of them turned to religion
for their entire political philosophy. blaming the Republicans just
because they happen to own the White House at the moment isn't logical
or historically accurate. the working class got fucked by everybody.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ableton Live vs Traktor DJ

oh no no no no. you do not understand me.

I will say it again -- plus or minus sixty percent.

beat-matching 80pm with 160bpm was my challenge back when Kruder &
Dorfmeister did their K7 DJ Kicks thingy. late 90s shit. no, I'm
talking about pitch-shifting an 80bpm record up to an absurd degree,
and pitch-shifting a 160bpm record down to an absurd degree.

80bpm * 60 percent =3D 80 * .6 =3D 48
80 + 48 =3D 128 =3D max tempo for record A: 128bpm

160 * 60 % =3D 160 * .6 =3D 96
160bpm - 96bpm =3D 64bpm =3D lowest achievable speed for record B: 64bpm

this means that the two records can match anywhere between 64bpm and
128bpm. this means you can take a hip-hop record and a jungle record
and play them both at dub tempo, play them both at hip-hop tempo, or
play them both at house tempo.

I'm not saying it's a good idea. I'm just saying I have determined it
to be technically feasible, beyond a shadow of a doubt. I'm not
dissing Live, either -- I'm sure you'd get smoother results with more
sophisticated technology -- but for the sake of accuracy, what you're
describing can be accomplished in some cases using only vinyl.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ableton Live vs Traktor DJ

You cannot achieve the same thing and keep the same pitch using just vinyl.

For instance - if a vocal track sound perfect at 120, if you pitch it to 
160, now the vocals sound like the frickin' chipmunks. If you pitch it down 
to 80bpm, it sounds like Barry White. (you get the point)

With Live, it sounds exactly as it did at 120 at 160, 180 or up (and vice 
versa).

The +/- features on turntables only allow you to match the beats...unless 
someone has put out decks that take care of that too.  (aside from the 
Pioneer CDJ's)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ableton Live vs Traktor DJ

The only thing is, pitch-corrected time stretching in real time often
sounds pretty nasty on Live, Acid, Traktor or the like- on a piece of
hardware like a CDJ or one of those fruity Stanton turntables with
"Master Pitch", it's just laughable!  Ewwy.

Certainly "close enough for jazz" though for mashup/remix on the fly
usage as long as the bed track that's really supplying the boom and
tizz is left at optimal speed/pitch.

Cheers,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ableton Live vs Traktor DJ

"Close enough for jazz"? My experience is that jazz guys are the
pickiest, least prone to corner-cutting guys on the planet. Classical
musicians are mercenaries by comparison. I mean look at Carl Craig. As
far as I can tell the only electronic music gear that was ever close
enough for jazz was the Korg Prophecy. Programming that thing requires
multiple graduate degrees in korgprophecyology.

Sorry, I just don't understand what you mean.

Thomas Trouble Ate My Balls once...Last i heard he was smoking crack that
was pressed between the thighs of a 14 year old virgin.

I talked mad shit about him once in front of Denise (DJ D) inadvertantly an=
d
she gave me some dirty looks (and not dirty in a i wanna take my clothes of=
f
and rub my genitals on your face kinda way).  My friend told me i had to no=
t
say that kinda stuff in front of her cause she looked up to him, but you
know what i say?  Fuck it, i can talk shit about anyone anytime and if they
got a problem with it i got a nice wet fart waiting for you to suck it out
of my asshole.

Never trouble thomas until thomas troubles you.

Which with his music and mixing, her manages to trouble me in the most
violating kinda way.

yes, I'm aware of that. I said PITCHSHIFTING. that would mean shifting

yes yes yes. I'm just saying however that the 80 <---> 160 beatmatch,
absurd a goal tho it is, can be achieved within the context of a
vinyl-only set. that's ALL I'm saying here.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ableton Live vs Traktor DJ

Hrm...the stuff I've heard on Live sounded pretty spot on. In fact, the 1st 
track I heard that was pitch-corrected I thought was some new remix of an 
old song all up-tempo, but it was the original...

Also, the CDJ800's pitch correction thingy sounded pretty good too - maybe 
it's just my ears that need cleaning?

Huh? Did you say something?

WHAT???

THE PARTY'S OVER, ALMOST, AT 48 ABELL

Last Call: Loft Crazies Have Had A Great Run, But Landlord Is Going Legit

It's an age-old story.  A lamp factory gets into the landlord business. 
Then the tenants throw parties so wild they'd make Caligula run into the 
night.

Within vomiting distance of Queen and Dufferin, 48 Abell St.  party palace 
is owned by Aristocrat Lamps and Lighting ...  and ...  um ...  Property 
Management Inc.  It's an old factory revamped into 85 lofts where, for 25 
years now, partying tenants have thrown open their doors and invited in 
the night crowd to rock and rattle the chandeliers stored in the basement.

It was in the late '70s, when the lamp and lighting business had started 
to dim, that Aristocrat's Mervin Hollander, the arts-loving son in the 
family business, got his great idea.  Why not downsize the factory and 
rent out the extra space to starving artists?

Then and now, starving artists like a bit of fun.

"The big party we had was the Green Party," recalls Sea Ansley, whose web 
media company, Universal Metropolis, until recently had a studio at 48 
Abell.  "We got evicted."

That was on May 7, 2005.  Ansley says the "green" theme was a celebration 
of green tea and environmental awareness -- but mostly pot.  Universal 
Metropolis set up a hip-hop room, a rave room and a "chill" room with 
chefs making quiche and fondue.  There was a contest for the best strain 
of pot.  "The prize was a giant Indian glass bong," said Ansley.

But Ansley and pals hadn't realized their party was on the same day as the 
city's Marijuana March.  "Our party turned into the afterparty," he said.

Ansley, who had briefly worried nobody would show up, watched in horror 
from sunset to sunrise as about 700 people packed the halls of 48 Abell, 
dancing, getting high, puking and passing out.  A scary guy with a meat 
cleaver ran around hacking pineapples.

Aristocrat had issues with the Green Party.  For one, the pipes burst in 
the basement where they kept their lamp stocks.  Universal Media got the 
boot.

Mervin Hollander wants to put 48 Abell on the right side of the law.  The 
building is zoned for studio workspaces, although it's an open secret that 
people live there.  Hollander wants to upgrade the property, make the 
transition legal.

Except for the dead, rusted cars outside, the pit bulls who don't pick up 
after themselves, and the smell of wet paint and pot leaking into the 
hallways, 48 Abell is downright homey.  Behind closed doors, tenants have 
decorated their loft walls with huge, bright, splashy canvases.  The vast 
spaces have fat, cushy old couches and chairs.  Ladders lead up to 
bedrooms on wooden platforms.  There's plenty of heat.  No mice.  No 
cockroaches.

But Hollander says engineers keep telling him it would cost a fortune to 
bring the building up to code.  Tear it down, they say, and start from 
scratch.

So he hired a development firm to rethink the property.  The developers 
propose two towers to replace the old building.  One would offer 
low-income housing with a mind to the art crowd.  The other will offer 
snappy condominiums to hipsters who can afford real estate.

People in the neighbourhood are opposing the revamp, saying it'll force 
out 48 Abell's current tenants.

And a shiny new condo tower might wreck the classic low-rise Victorian 
look of Queen West.

In the meantime, going legit means cracking down on the nuttiness.

"We've done a lot to curb the reputation of booze cans and parties," says 
Nancy Estrela, who works in Aristocrat's ground floor office.

Estrela plays the unhappy role of party pooper.

"Everyone knows who I am," she says.  Her day ends at 5 p.m., but if 
there's a party that night, Estrela hears about it.  "You always have a 
neighbour who's ticked off.  So there's snitching."

The rising profile of the neighbourhood is also forcing Aristocrat's heavy 
hand.

The revamped Drake and Gladstone hotels have attracted a stampede of new 
partiers.  Estrela says after last call at the Drake, the still thirsty 
find 48 Abell just a hop, skip and a stagger away.

Estrela has safety concerns.

"It's a wood structure building so we can't have people smoking," she 
says, then adds: "The fire department has no sense of humour."

Estrela says there's a negative vibe at work that has nothing to do with 
management.  "The tenants changed.  They got older."

Friendly rents of $800 to $1,500 per studio have produced "not much flip," 
as Estrela puts it -- meaning some tenants at 48 Abell are overstaying 
their own scene.

Take, for example, David Park, 28.  He and his roommates threw a party in 
their loft last summer, featuring a giant inflatable pool.  Door crashers 
from a bachelor party down the hall added to the mayhem.

The wet floor the next morning wasn't as bad as what happened to the 
neglected pool after a couple of weeks.  "Algae started to form," says 
Park.  "It smelled funny.  It started to get kind of browny green." He 
looks sick, recalling it.  "I don't want to talk about it any more."

Park regrets the party.  The crazy stuff is getting old.  "I guess the 
party's over for me," he says.  "I'm kind of tired more, don't want to go 
out as much."

If the development plans go through, the building will be razed within a 
couple of years.  One tenant, illustrator Clayton Hanmer, predicts the art 
crowd will build a new bohemia somewhere else.

"It's not really my neighbourhood any more," he says, a reference to the 
weekenders "from Woodbridge and stuff" drawn to the reno hotels.  He 
misses that golden age of cheap beers among old men at the Gladstone.  And 
"the Drake was just boarded up and nasty," he recalls.  "Crack whores used 
to go there.  It was awesome."

Ex-tenant Ansley says there's already a buzz around 48 Abell about the 
hypothetical "last party" if the loft crowd gets displaced.  One last 
shout in a building about to be torn down.

"It'll be Toronto's biggest party of the decade," he says confidently.

Aristocrat might want to move out the chandeliers this time.

Thank you for stating what should be obvious.  It's like we're part of a

No more rave parties at the Great Wall
(Beijing Today)
Updated: 2005-11-21 11:09

Critical media coverage of a rave party that saw 1,500 local and expat 
revelers gather at the Jinshanling section of the Great Wall this summer 
has prompted local authorities to prohibit any future events.

of the Wall this summer. [Ynet]

Cheng Dalin, deputy director of China Great Wall Society said that local 
government had re-assumed management of the Jinshanling Great Wall, 
previously overseen by the local tourism bureau.

The party at the Wall, criticized as "bawdy" in media reports, provoked 
widespread anger among Chinese people. One article in Hong Kong-based Next 
Magazine claimed that the Great Wall of China had been taken over by sex, 
drugs and rock and roll, accompanied by pictures of the inappropriate 
behavior of some party-goers.

CCTV followed up with an investigative report, revealing, that in 1997 a 
company called Guangda signed a 50-year lease with local authorities. The 
company claimed that it earned revenue by allowing use of its facilities 
at a charge of 60 yuan per head. The party organizers sold tickets for the 
event at 200 yuan each.

Fabrizio Zambuto, a photographer working in Beijing, said that he had 
attended several such parties at the Wall over the past five years, said, 
"Most people who went to the party respected the Wall."

Wall in Hebei Province this summer. [Ynet]

He thought that some people's disrespectful behavior could be put down to 
a lack of facilities such as litter bins and toilets.

William Lindesay, founder and director of International Friends of the 
Great Wall, said "I have been going to rock parties for 25 years. But the 
Great Wall is something so majestic, it is not a place for that kind of 
party." Seven years ago Lindesay heled start public clean-up days at the 
Great Wall. He remains devoted to conserving the Wall.

Lindesay recalled how four years ago an Australian TV station provided him 
with video footage of a rave party at the Great Wall.

"The film showed dancing that was very inappropriate," he said. Last week, 
Lindesay and members of his organization donated 30 litter bins to the 
Jinshanling Great Wall management department.

The bins carry the slogan, 'He who does not love the Great Wall is not a 
true man, a version of Chairman Mao's famous words "He who does not reach 
the Great Wall is not a true man."

It is too early to say for certain whether a party will be held at the 
Wall next year. DJ Dio, one of the main organizers for this year's event 
said, "I think we should continue the tradition of having rave parties. If 
the authorities won't allow us to do so, of course we won't hold them 
there. But the last party we held was officially approved and we had all 
the paperwork done.?

Huang Yaohui, from China Great Wall Society, said that damage to the Great 
Wall has occurred not only at Jinshanling but to other sections too. He 
blames this on a combination of shortcomings in legislation, insufficient 
public awareness and poor supervision from relative agencies.

William Lindesay says that education is the key to protecting the Wall. 
Each time he visits the Great Wall, he asks other tourists to deal with 
trash they have discarded, "I remember once when I asked some people to 
pick up their litter, they thanked me for pointing it out rather than 
being offended."

My friend Don just sold a Prophecy. I don't recall it ever being especially 
complicated - but maybe he could correct me.

"Close enough for jazz"? My experience is that jazz guys are the
pickiest, least prone to corner-cutting guys on the planet. Classical
musicians are mercenaries by comparison. I mean look at Carl Craig. As
far as I can tell the only electronic music gear that was ever close
enough for jazz was the Korg Prophecy. Programming that thing requires
multiple graduate degrees in korgprophecyology.

Sorry, I just don't understand what you mean.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SupperClub NYE 2005??

well, from what management has told me we are doing a 10 course dinner for 
150$ plus champagne  (invite only)  we will have the after party that goes 
untill 2pm the next day.
A little birdie whipspered in my ear that we have Lee Coombs, Garth, Jeno, 
Charlotte the Baroness Thump Radio in the early AM among others.  I am NOT 
100% on the lineup, but I will let everyone know once I figure it out.  They 
want me to work 14 hours straight with breaks of course, and I would love to 
  ;)
I think we are the only other club in the city with permits to allow us to 
go that late other than the End Up.
there will be a cover at the door.
Again, let me get more details.
Danny
And SupperClub should "crack you up" that is why we are here :P

Traktor will key lock at something like +/- 200 on the pitch, not that 
things sound right at that setting!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ableton Live vs Traktor DJ

Ear cleaning might be good, for me CDJs start getting ugly after about 2%
on pitch lock mode, I'd rather mix out of key than have them destroy a
song like that.  ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ableton Live vs Traktor DJ

Well, I don't OWN cdj's (currently), so my knowledge is limited. I was just 
given an overview of them a couple of weeks ago, and what I heard sounded 
really good. Maybe it was that particular track?

Speaking of CDJ's - anyone have a Pioneer 800 they might wanna unload on the 
semi-cheap???

Personally, I prefer people working than stealing.  When did looking for a
job become such a bad thing?  Fuck, if I'd get my lazy ass to work more, I
wouldn't be so deep in debt.   That's just me, I'm a fucko with bad habits.
But for some reason my blue eyes make it easy for people to understand my
hardships.

Maybe I wouldn't have such an issue with this if my ancestors didn't enter
the country illegally (on the good ship Mayflower.)  Native Americans
--including Mexicans; I'm assuming,  had laws about territory?

Of course they did.  Texas Independence, Wounded Knee, the Alamo, the battle
for the West...  these wars were all about immigration.

It's sad that after all this time America still can't make sense of the
past, bite the bullet, and accept that this country was founded on theft,
kidnapping,  slavery and genocide.  And in light of  Mexicans taking over
"our" country, why are the Iraqi insurgents so pissed off?

Because we're all just a bunch of filthy goddamn Mexicans.

Fuck dude,  no one's ever coming after me--  I'm as white as a Cape Cod
picket fence.     So why does this disturb me so much?

respect,
boomerang

P.S.  I believe you, that your viewpoint isn't racist.... it's more
socio-political.  In my response I strayed away from your balanced claim.
But still... big picture man, see the big picture.  Peace, and happy
holidays.  

P.P.S.   You mentioned construction...  if that's your work, hit me up, i
can try to hook you up with the Stagehand's Union, which includes everything
from carpentry to audio production.  If you're not already with a union,
that is.  Hecka nice pay and benefits.   Which is great if you tend to blow
your scholarships on liquor, drugs and women.  ;o)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ableton Live vs Traktor DJ

Well, that's where the whole "you can just hop on this thing and let it 
drive itself" theory is blown out of the window (I would guess - I'm sure 
George can correct me if I'm wrong though - thanks George!). You still have 
to have a sense of how to DJ using a program like that. So I'm sure you have 
to work it like you would decks. I think it just makes it a little easier.

The biggest thing that annoys me about folks who dismiss DJing programs and 
tools as "cheating" is, you still have to have a reasonable sense of how to 
craft a set, layer and transition tracks, etc. You COULd just let the 
program do it all for you, but it'll sound like ass as a result.

Live is actually very good with any tracks that are layered without very strong kick-drums. There is a number of tools, but the bottom line is - when you edit the clip for playing it later, you can choose to warp (time-stretch) the clip in any way you desire. In other words, if you want the funk track to be at 120 BPM, you just set up the markers within clip editing, warp the track, and voila. You can also set the track up to be 4/4, 3/6, or whatever the hell else your heart desires. In addition to that, Live has various ways of how it time-stretches the tracks depending on the size of sound "grains" you want to use. Beats are easiest to time-stretch, but other options such as textures, complex sounds, etc. are available. Hope this help!

track where a drum machine was not used, hence the BPM fluctuates all

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."
-Don Juan

"A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves."
-Edward R. Murrow

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

The fact is Republicans and Democrats alike have no need to put a dramatic
halt to the influx of illegal immigrants, even though some of them like to
play the facade that they are trying to do something about it.  Capitalism
thrives on cheap labor: "The Walmart Theory"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ableton Live vs Traktor DJ

well, wtf do I know. these conversations always devolve into status
wars anyway. ninety percent of the time it's some idiot posting
senseless madness just to get people to look at him. we might as well
just be whipping our dicks out and lining up to measure them with a
ruler. or a yardstick. or, in my case, satellite photography.

I had this one dude, one time, posting to a list I was on, like three
days after I praised Event Trias, and he's posting all about how
nobody who knew what they were doing would ever use Event monitors of
any kind for any reason ever ever ever. he sidestepped my post, and
then dissed it when I wasn't looking, like some kind of cowardly
little bitch. so the next day I see "Scratch," and in the scene where
Q-Bert and DJ Shadow are scratching, like in a jam session, guess what
their monitor system is? Event Tria. same shit I got in my room right
here.

every time, man. every fucking time.

some people just get the monkey. you even give them a shot, but no,
the monkey is the only thing they're willing to earn. you're like,
hey, I could give you some props, you want some props? and they're
like, give me the monkey! and you're like, you're sure? I got all
these props right here, some of them would fit you perfectly, I mean
look at these ones here, they even match your t-shirt, same shade of
blue, brings out the color of your eyes -- and they just interrupt you
like, fuck you! the monkey! hand it over now!

it's like, ok, ok, here's your monkey. take it, go.

anyway, the Korg Prophecy -- I sold my Prophecy too. one of the worst
mistakes I ever made. when I said it was complex I meant the
programming -- getting sound out of it was easy. in fact it was
incredibly easy, unbelievable expressive power, the thing had this
ribbon board you could push, pull, and slide your fingers around on in
a thousand different ways. if you switched from fingertips to
fingernails? different sound. that was where the interface they
eventually used on the Kaoss Pad initially came from. but they put it
on a mod wheel, so you could simultaneously work in additional
dimensions (i.e., modulate resonance with your fingertips, and filter
pitch with the wheel). it also had a regular mod wheel, and the
standard pitch bend wheel as well. that thing was so nice. I get
wistful just thinking about it. I probably have more affection for the
Prophecy I sold than I do for most of my ex-girlfriends.

sold my Tria, too, but I had enough sense to get a new one. nearly got
rid of that, too, but luckily I recovered my senses. (luckily for me
at least.)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ableton Live vs Traktor DJ

Getting things warped correctly in live involves dragging "warp
markers" which denote bar /beat locations onto their appropriate
locations over the waveform itself.  In this way, you can actually
make an off-time drummer as rigid as a drum machine, if desired.

Subject: [sfraves] my foul temper

as shameful as it is, I'm glad to see it hasn't prevented people from
resubbing. in fact we've seen the return of long-lost sfravers --
first shazbot, then andy. odd that I can't seem to keep my cool when I
want to see this list healthy and full of traffic, just like anyone
who's been on here for such a long time. it's like the left hand
doesn't know what the right hand is doing, isn't it?

grr! argh!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:>> Need some Excel and gener office help in my home office

I need some immediate help in my home office (Moved back home and my
dad's heath is getting progressively worse) Just moved him home so he
could be with family as he is on life support and not doing well in the
hospital. Due to this I have utter chaos in my surroundings (IE
Disorganized) and getting frustrated. The companies are growing faster
than I can keep up with, hence things are getting dropped.=20

I need help in the following areas in order of priority:

1. MS Office Excel Formulas ( I need to make several cost + markup   =20
   Templates, Quoting Templates, Payroll Time Cards that we can put up
on =20
   the intranet.

2. Help streamline an organization process and help me to stick with it
:-)

3. Voice Processing Tree on the PBX Switch (Need to make a new tree and

   update telephone extension and activate new hires voicemail box - I
can=20
   help you learn this part)

4. Check our main voicemail extensions for sales and support and=20
   forward/book appointments accordingly

5. Keep me from slipping :-)

6. General office tasks and errands.

I am not sure the number of hours I will need someone, but we can
discuss this based on a match. I am located in South San Jose (Sana
Terressa and Snell). Snell light rail station is just around the corner
:-)

If this opportunity interests you, please zip me your resume and call
the main office 408-385-1732 x109 and leave me a message. I need ASAP
:-)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: DJ Amok vs Catharsis Live Mix 11.24.05

Greets,

Well Konvolve was a nice event last week. For a moment there was a bit of 
hard techno in the SF.. ;)  DJ Amok is a very cool dude and I had the 
opportunity to throw down with him the morning after the event on KZSU 
Stanford radio. The recording came out great and is available here:
http://www.egregious.net/events/2005/konvolve/#livemix

I look forward to attempting to kick start a hard techno / rhythmic 
industrial / powernoise scene here in SF geared more towards the 
underground outside the clubs.  Hope to see you out next time...

Best,
--Mike

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm



"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path  
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and  
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of  
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will  
gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

CLUB SCENE GROWS UP

The party isn't over in S.F. -- it has just moved on to smaller,  
mellower places. Nights of excess in huge venues give way to calmer  
gatherings in more intimate settings.

Carolyne Zinko, Chronicle Staff Writer
Friday, December 2, 2005

On a Thursday night at Mars Bar, at the corner of Seventh and Brannan  
streets, Carla Eggleston, 40, stood on the patio, smoking a cigarette  
and contemplating her surroundings.

Music from the dance floor wafted outside. Strands of colored lights  
twinkled over tables where people mingled. Men were dressed as if  
inspired by Gap commercials. Women favored halter tops or halter  
dresses atop jeans with high heels, their arms bare despite a chill  
in the air.

For Eggleston, a decorative painter who used to go to cavernous dance  
clubs where talking was less important than bumping and grinding  
until 2 a.m., the subdued scene was just fine.

"I was just at a large club last Saturday, and it was a mosh scene,"  
she said. "I got pushed around and spilled on. ... It's no fun for us  
adults. I'm so happy to be here -- it's nice and mellow. I know  
everybody.''

Raving with the masses is out. Sipping in selective company is in. A  
downbeat economy, the aging of Generation X and the pendulum-like  
swing of fashion (and of fashionable drugs) are spurring a trend away  
from the previous decade's favorite way to party -- DJ dance fests  
for 1,000 or more -- toward gatherings at small bars and clubs where  
people can talk without shouting, drink without being spilled on and  
spare themselves exorbitant cover charges.

Ever since the dot-com bust flushed thousands of well-paid young  
people -- and their money -- out of the Bay Area faster than a bar's  
last call, it also has been closing the door on partying to excess.  
Some dance clubs have closed, and the bigger ones are lucky to fill  
up once a week, several party promoters said.

"Big clubs were an era that was very important -- it was a time of  
celebration and the evolution of the big-name DJ as entertainer,''  
said Audrey Joseph, vice president of the San Francisco Entertainment  
Commission, who ran Club Townsend on Harrison Street for 10 years.

Now, she said, "there's a move to a lounge society -- and to people  
staying at home, Tivo-ing shows, playing videos and meeting people  
online. Lounges are easier to access, less expensive and so numerous  
that they tend to develop their own little crowds. You can pick and  
choose where you want to go.''

In the 1990s and early 2000s, it was not unusual for clubs to have  
cover charges of $35, $40 or even $50 -- necessary to fly in DJs from  
London, Amsterdam or even Ibiza and pay them the going rate of  
$35,000 for a night's work.

But now, customers can't -- or won't -- pony up for high cover  
charges plus drinks at $10 apiece for a night's entertainment.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times  
as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one  
question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My  
benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was  
too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I  
will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does  
the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: DIRTY w/ Uberzone and Carbon Community - SATURDAY @ Studio Z

yes, there are two seperate parties.  two seperate entrances.  two
seperate lineups.  both in one night.

DIRTY is 21+ and will be in the main room of Studio Z.  all breaks.=20
thrown by Evil Breaks.

Black Magik is 18+ and will be in the back room.  breaks and trance.=20
thrown by Evil Breaks and Electrosorcery.

Uberzone and Carbon Community will be doing full, live PAs at DIRTY.=20
they will be doing laptop sets at Black Magik.

we did this because Evil Breaks has kinda been living in two worlds.=20
we play at and have thrown many all ages parties and have a following
among the younger ravers.  we also play at and throw many 21+ parties
and have a following among older clubbers, burners and geriatric
ravers.  so since we were bringing in these two fantastic acts, we
wanted everyone to have a chance to see them in their own, comfortable
setting.  DIRTY will be very much what our older crowd expects.  Black
Magik, in association with Electrosorcery, will be very much "rave."

we hope folks aren't too confused!  we just want everyone to come out,
have a good time, and enjoy some really fucking awesome music!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: DIRTY w/ Uberzone and Carbon Community - SATURDAY @ Studio Z

a word on presales.

we are currently at 80 tickets sold online for Dirty.  judging from
how our past shows have done, this is a sign that this party may
actually sell out!

if you want to make sure you get in, i'd suggest getting a presale or
show up early.

i know, that sounds like a bunch of marketting hoo-ey...but that's a
lot of ticket sales for a venue with a capacity of about 400.  that
and the fact that we gave away a LOT of free tickets via our email
lists, radio shows, etc.

you can still grab yours on Groovetickets.com until midnight tonight!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] CLUB SCENE GROWS UP

Yes, I've seen this already, and I have my skepticism about it. (Of
course.) Number one thing -- a lot of the most interesting things in
the SF music scene, you're more likely to spot if you buy London drum
and bass fanzines for the breaks reviews than you are if you're
getting your news from the local SF paper. Audio Angel did all the
vocals for the new Influx album; the Violence crew just finished an
album too (very popular d&b label based in SF, with one London member
who moved to SF to record the album and then went home). Zero blips on
the SF local media radar, pages of coverage in London. And you guys
are hearing it from a guy in Santa Fe.

Weird, huh?

Anyway, I have to tell you, I've seen this exact article before, in
the Chicago Reader, in 1993. You'll see it again in ten years' time,
somewhere. There's an inevitability to this sort of thing,
particularly since the type of people who write for magazines and
papers generally think of themselves as cooler than they actually are,
and thus **always** interpret trends in their own social circles as
the future of society in general. What actually happened is some
writer observed to some other writer that neither of them really felt
like going to big clubs any more, and behold! they discovered the
future of nightlife. All this means is that we're underground again,
as if we needed somebody to tell us that.

If you're really feeling threatened? Don't. Lounge scenes never last
long -- it's like having a "scene" that revolves around wallpaper and
sofas -- and for some reason their musical output is rarely
competitive even with elevator muzak in terms of quality. Back when
lounge was allegedly cool in Chicago, I picked up some tracks by 18th
Street, the guys who eventually became Thievery Corporation. I threw
the CD away after I took a cab downtown and recognized an 18th Street
track on the cabbie's easy listening radio station. I just wasn't
ready to be part of that demographic.

DJs shouldn't read the paper anyway. Does a bird need a weatherman to
tell it the direction of the wind? But if you do read the paper, read
a paper like Knowledge, ATM, or Mofo (which is hard to get in the
States, but worth it.)

should be so thankful that people are keeping it going strong.  Because =

Diversity is now spread over several weeks or months.  And I should be =
going to everything I like because that's in most of our nature as =
ravers.  To support what we like and cherish what we love.

that's because eighteenth street lounge is heavily influenced
by bossa nova and soundtracky stuff.  they released some
compilations that was all groovy bossa stuff, like "the girl
from ipanema" and wes montgomery.  it's elevator music, really.

but the stuff they produce was pretty good.  their new album
has changed all of that, unfortunately.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] CLUB SCENE GROWS UP


I still dig the track Lebonese Blonde and that other
one on the same record...

A few weeks back I had dinner at Levende Lounge which
I guess is part of the scene the article refers to. 
It was a decent (not great) dinner and the music was
decent too.  Some DJ jamming with a live guitarist and
a live bongo player.  It was a pleasant evening but we
didn't stay long enough for dancing.  I'd definitely
go back though.  I sort of like the idea of having a
nice dinner, and then loungng around, and then
dancing.  IMO there's room for both the lounge and the
large super club/rave.  They're two totally different
experiences.

Subject: [sfraves] incredible funk

I have had the baddest fucking business idea anybody ever had in their
LIVES this morning. It is simple. It is easy to implement. It is a
fucking GOLDMINE. And even if it fails, it is 100% pure PROPS from
start to finish.

Oh SHIT could this be cool.

I'll tell you all a little bit more later.

Maybe.

as far as i know, levende plays to the more house-oriented

Subject: Re: [sfraves] CLUB SCENE GROWS UP

Well hey I am part of the "house-oriented crowd" then
I guess ;)

Right Mirror Conspiracy is the record.  The track
Indra was the other one I was thinking about.  Its
also a classic I think.

I think we might have seen Late Night Sneaky actually.
 I knew the DJ looked familiar but I couldn't place
him.

The next night was a Pink Mammoth anniversary with
Kevin Yost, and I'm a big fan of his music.  I should
have planned my babysitting for that night but oh
well.

I thought Levende was pretty nice, the music was good,
the crowd was mixed and having fun, and the drinks
were great.  Really the only complaint I had was that
the menu was a bit spotty; some things we had were
really good and others not so much.

In sum, I'd go back for sure.

Peter

Subject: [sfraves] Your Party Suggestions for the Week of December 4-11, 2005

My birthday is this Thursday, December 8th, 2005 - an interesting date in 
history - day of birth of Jim Morrison (1943), date of death of John 
Lennon (1980)...

I luckily receive a number of notifications about events in the SF Bay 
Area - and am interested and curious to know * what your suggestions are 
for bangin' events in the SF Bay Area to dance and your booty your booty 
to for the week of December 4-11, 2005* :)

All genres, all musical styles, all spaces and places are considered ...

(I'm down with classical, jazz, rock, and a plethora of ... non 
electronica forms of music ... )

Thanks and Love
Karina

Karina - happy almost your birthday!
   
  I would suggest going to see Rosie Thomas at Bottom of the Hill tonight, Sunday at 9:00. 
   
  http://www.rosiethomas.com/ is terrific - kind of a folk-rocky singer, but totally individual and with an odd and hilarious sense of humor. She's just a great song writer. She also does stand-up and tells little stories - her show could be anything. I don't know anything about the other two bands playing with her, but Rosie Thomas alone is worth more than $10. I wish I could go so I hope she does a great performance if you decide to check her out.

Subject: [sfraves] RE: [events] Other Artists Petition


Personally, I am really pushing for the new build outs! I tear down
places like this everyday and build more efficient living communities.
IE Solar, Better energy efficiency in materials, safer communities. If
the owners want to sell it or develop it......... LET THEM! It's THEIRS,
NOT YOURS! If you want it to stay the community that it is, well buy it!
The amount of people living and using that facility.......... should be
very simple to crate a trust and buy it! If ya need help on organizing
the trust......... I am totally down! Remember......... Everything
happens for a reason, maybe this will be the push to find a perfect spot
that should be owned and never torn down or taken away from the artists!
Quit bitching and start doing something if your sick of loosing spaces!=20

Being a large land owner, having let the community use my spaces, and
EVERY TIME had issues! Reckless DRUG Use, damage to the building, damage
to neighbors, car accidents, assaults etc..... Maybe the community
should better police itself so the rest of the world has a better VIEW
of the Artists! Just my thoughts.... Take it for what you will!

Matt

Subject: Re: [sfraves] incredible funk

no no no no no. god I shouldn't have even posted that. I just had this
idea and I was like holy fucking shit. I've had a million business
ideas, this is the only one I've had which seemed actually worth the
effort of forming a company. but it doesn't involve drug smuggling, or
churning out code for corporate America, it's the most beautiful
business idea anybody ever had and by Thursday I'll probably have
forgotten I ever had it. it probably won't ever happen, but my God it
would be beautiful if it did.

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. well, it will have to remain a mystery. back to
the arguing about politics, or whatever. why did I even mention it?

I tell you what, I'll make it a contest. guess what my business idea
is. if you get it right, you get to propagate any story you want about
me, and I'll swear every word is true.

Does anyone know what happens if you do not go to  jury duty but have a doctor's note stating it is not in your best  interest and a legitimate loathing for this judicial system?

agreed - great party! carbon community ripped it  just as i thought they would. uberzone came on strong as well, but my  crew was pretty well lit by that point so i didn't catch their whole  performance. 
  
  i saw lots of familiar faces, including my boys from dallas which was a  treat. i found out after the fact that cradlerock had me on the list,  but evil breaks already had my money so oh well. special props to the  door staff for letting me act da fool during the pat-downs (unrelated).  much love to marco as well for the drinks!
  
  did the black majik party up the road ever heat up? i had some friends  playing over there and popped in a couple times, but it seemed fairly  dead. the studio z party, on the other hand, was tearing the roof off. 
  
  good times!
  
  love,
  mo

The 'Operator' keeps clipping whenever I try to play any of the patches. It sounds OK on the first note, but if I play the same note, say three times, it starts sounding like a static nightmare. Could this have anything to do with it *possibly* not being the "over-the-counter" version? Reason & Sound Forge seem to work fine, so I don't think it's a soundcard or controller issue. Just curious if this has happened to anyone else<?>

Subject: [sfraves] yay

Thanks to everyone who came out and made my birthday fun on Friday, it
really felt like a partay.  There was spanking AND flogging and a Miles
Maeda appearance and birthday shots and Ambient Mafia t-shirts and various
assorted other things afoot.

George and I played 1.5 hours of our music and it was the first time I
felt like playing all our own stuff really worked as a full set going
through peaks and valleys and different styles just like as if we were
playing other people's music.  The sfr dancefloor support was mucho
appreciated, Anu was as a rockin' as it gets.

So yay, thanks, and get ready for George's special day next month, shhh
it's a secret don't tell anyone but I hear he's hitting a milestone with
this one so let's make sure to blow it out. ;)

A

Thanks.

One thing, though, if you mention me and hippie in the same sentence in 
any way other than "Alex fucking hates hippies, and will stab them on 
sight," I'll fucking stab you.

was everything that you played your own production?  i recognized lots
of tracks from your sampler mix you put out earlier this year.

if every track was your own, then i'm really impressed.  there was one
in particular that was extraordinarily funky.  i might even play it
myself.

ew, i said i'd play house music.

was everything that you played your own production?  i recognized lots
of tracks from your sampler mix you put out earlier this year.

if every track was your own, then i'm really impressed.  there was one
in particular that was extraordinarily funky.  i might even play it
myself.

ew, i said i'd play house music.

I haven't been to big on contemporary DnB, maybe I'm stuck in the past
listening to all the old stuff by Good Lookin Label, Moving Shadow, Seba &
Pariah, Roni Size Reprazent, Johnny L, and Goldie.  I was recently visiting
the native instruments website and came across Exile, who was doing a low
budget demo video for NI's Reaktor.  What he did in the video was pretty
amazing, when you consider the newbreed of laptop "live PA's" who do little
more than tweek a few knobs cuing premade samples/loops/productions.  This
guy makes songs in realtime, and adds the ability to improv and remix live-
a lot more than just playing a cued loop or sound effect too!   Judging fro=
m
his other music I've checked out and the reviews from his shows- somebody
needs to book this guy soon!  -And this is a house/techno head saying this.

His shit is indeed amazing - he uses a custom Reaktor ensemble, I
believe.   There's a 10min-ish video of one of his live sets floating
around... i keep watching it over and over and cursing the brits for
getting to see him play all the time.

Some of his released tracks are a bit too undanceable squarepusher for
me (i love squarepusher, just not usually for the dancefloor) but on
the whole, the man is bringing a nice slice of glitch to the dnb
wurld.

It sickens me that the new Pope would bring back a tradition from those 
days.

They did that to get criminals to go on the crusades. And any of us who know 
our history know what the result of that was...especially seeing as how 
we're still feeling them.

Subject: [sfraves] chill-out meditation-friendly dvds and cds :)





hello sfravers  :)

(yo, Marc(0)! wassup! come home! ;)

system recordings, the dance music label, has a new line of
meditation-friendly, yoga-friendly cds and dvds called nature's balance
which are lovely.

the music is by john hazen, a sound designer for film, who has created
beautiful ambient soundscapes which are soothing, centering, healing.

waterfalls, snowfalls and forest rays ...  (and if i had an ipod i could
download them from itunes, lol).

http://www.systemrecordings.com/naturesbalance/

am putting out word because i realized these are a good gift idea for the
spiritually inclined or for peeps who just need to chill out and breathe
for a while.

am also a long-time big fan of system recordings.  :)

happy holidays!

peace,
mary :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) news

Like your grandma? I bet she LOVES Rigo Chacon and channel 7,  
contrary to me at this point in my life; as for me, give me NPR, the  
blogosphere, and my worldwide-flung friends who contribute daily to  
my LTG list everyday. For example, did Rigo have a story on Beethoven  
dying of lead poisoning, just now determined by genetic analysis? I  
bet not! BTW, I'm waiting to see what the younger gen who now hold  
forth on sfraves have to say!

Every great advance in natural knowledge has involved the absolute
rejection of authority.  --Thomas H. Huxley

Subject: Re: [sfraves] incredible funk

no, there is no 20 questions. sorry, just saw this now. I have no idea
what manic impulse possessed me to post this on sfraves at all. this
is a big big secret plan which will remain large and mysterious until
such a time as I see fit to perform acts of plan-shrinkage and/or
plan-revelation.

until that time, here are the only things I will tell you:

- it doesn't involve writing software

- it is for DJs

- it is expensive

- it is cool

- I probably won't get around to it anyway

- it would require an entire team of clever hooligans

oh, wait, I just read my own post. I said you could guess.
hmmmmmmmmmm, well, I've changed my mind. no guessing. big big secret
plan. secret. plan.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."
-Don Juan

"A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves."
-Edward R. Murrow

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP:  bODY eLECTRIC

My boys Ken & Juan!!!!!! I suggest if you househeads have never seen these 
two perform, you get on it like white on rice. I have watched them start as 
just a duo of house lovin' dj's, and seen their production flourish from 
it's humble beginnings. I can't tell you how many times I have watched these 
two decknicians rip up dancefloors with their signature funk flavoured 4x4 
love.

I may have to slip out of the holiday shindig I'm s'posed to go to for this 
event...I haven't had my house fix in quite some time.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] incredible funk

In all fairness that was like an 8am revelation or something. I hadn't
even had my first cup of coffee. my brain doesn't function until it's
had about seven or eight. I fucked up, shouldn't have said a word,
won't have the time to make it happen, or, more importantly, the
partners, so you'll all just have to wait until somebody with better
connections, better follow-through, and nothing else on their mind has
the same idea. sorry! just forget I ever brought it up. won't happen.
never gonna be. don't think about it. don't wonder about it. don't sit
around speculating as to what it might be. the whole thing is just a
smokescreen to distract you from those terrible rumors so you won't
think about me at all. the product is inevitable anyway, somebody else
will create it, it will be massively nifty, and you will all buy these
things, even though you'll never guess, when it happens, that this is
what I was talking about. in fact I didn't have any business idea at
all, I don't have an entrepreneurial bone in my body, I don't know a
thing about how to make money, and I have to go write lists of women
I'd like to bone, so, terribly sorry, but I've got a very full plate
right now. bye!

I'll give you all a hint, though: speed seduction. ^_^

I'll give you all a hint, though: speed seduction. ^_^

Subject: [sfraves] sort of BSP  Re: [sfraves] the haps for this coming weekend???any bsp's??

Folded is just the 1st Friday of the month, hoss!  COME FOR THE JANUARY
6TH EDITION PLZ KTHX.  AndyW, Fingermonsters, MY BIRTHDAY, whooty!  

Folded this month was Andrew, Jessi, and Stacey's birthday blowout. 
People got straight FLOGGED..  It was rather ill.

Anyway, I hate writing anything that smacks of BSP but I have to say,
my last b-day Folded was one of the more insane party nights I've had
in a while, and this year I turn.. uh... old, so I plan to do it up
crazier, even.

The thing is, to make merry, I need HELP.  Your help.  Your hip flask's
help.  Your arms to hold me up while swigging from that hip flask.

Anyhow, the FingerMonsters will be repping in full force for the first
time since OW Halloween.  I am really stoked on that.  How will we fit
our gear?  What will we dress like?  Will my moustache fall off halfway
through?

Who knows..  I guess you'll hafta just come.

Subject: [sfraves] Late weekend review!!

I know im a bit late on this review I have been lagging for the most part 
but here goes.

Came out of my shell for a few parties this past weekend and damn it was 
well worth it!!

Let me start off by saying the Evil breaks boys know how to GET the F@#$ 
down!! I stepped into studio Z and the walls were banging  people all over 
the place just getting down to the wicked grooves of carbon community first 
time at an all breaks party and it was going off hard. They made the live PA 
fun to watch and interactive with the drumming.. Carbon tore the floor.. got 
a few drinks and whehhhhh the party was flowing Uberzone.... What could be 
said they ripped they are freakin awesome.. if you missed it  well you truly 
missed out rocking hard.. Ok time for the random spotting..

Got to see and talk to old peeps I don't normally see..

Terry (Viberation) oh yea and of course Terry had the visuals on lock... 
expect nothing but the best from terry and crew.

Ryan (Innocentchild) Yea our SFR poster boy is back in the country for a 
quick minute :-)
Philip Diaz.. See him post often but hardly ever see him..
Hello 2 day... That needs no intro ya'll know the man the legend!!
Lance.. some dood that I have known since JR high.. He actually posted my 
Jr. high yearbook picture to this list about 9 years back funny shit y0!!!
Dina dragn'fly, Terry "Buglady" Jared majere  And a few others that im 
missing off the top of my dome so please forgive me if I forgot to mention 
seeing you


Then it was over to Black majik which was a bit more mellow but still 
banging with people rocking the floor. Denise and Dina were rocking the 
crowd hung out there for a bit then back to Ubbbbberzone.. to finish off my 
night..


Before that was a trip to tripendecular.. Nice younger party with a thick 
vibe 3 rooms packed to the rim and funny thing that one of the DJ's pointed 
out was there was NO trance in any of the 3 rooms and the crowd was still 
working up a frenzy and up for the House and Dnb Good to see a younger crowd 
into multi genre's  Got to love UG warehouse locations.. nice big space with 
about 800 heads or so up in there.. Good time with decent sound systems and 
solid DJ's


Overall it was a good night for partys thanks to all the promoters that let 
me promote at your events I had a good time!

PS: If you have never been to an "evil breaks" I highly suggest you do if 
you have the means..



One,

Macadio

So yea, I was trolling through yet another dnb forum last night, and I came
across a posting that was interesting.
I guess DSL is going to be playing in Sacto again, come the 28th of
december.

Has anyone got him booked to play SF any time soon?

K&K Music is San Jo I know rents gear that may have CDJ's for rent..

Or contact Dynamic sound and lighting also in SJ. They rent out gear too.. I 
think K&K's pricing might be a bit better but I dunno for sure.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] good rekkid stores for breaks in SF?

No.

At least in my opinion there's not. Most of the stores are seriously 
outdated on stock - jocking tracks from 6 months ago (or older) as brand 
new. It's pretty pathetic.

I buy damn near everything online - if you want a list of bomb-ass stores, 
lemme know!

Daniel Bell is one of the most important and respected names in the history
of dance music.  His stripped-down funky style, epitomized in his
underground hit "Losing Control", influenced a generation of producers and
helped launch a new "minimal" aesthetic in dance music. Having lived in
Berlin since 2000 and spent the last 2 years touring around the world, we
are honored to present this true pioneer in his first SF appearance in over
5 years.

Daniel Bell's Biography:  (courtesy of Telegraph Records)

Born in Sacramento, California, Daniel Bell grew up outside of Toronto ,
Canada, and then moved to Detroit where he collaborated with Richie Hawtin
as Cybersonik for three years on +8 Records. In 1991, he started his own
label, Accelerate, on which he released his influential releases as DBX.
Based on nearby Chicago "track" records, he reduced that sound further into
funky, streamlined grooves. The formula proved to be successful and helped
launch a new aesthetic in techno and house music known as "minimal".

With the overwhelming success of his "Losing Control" single in 1994, Danie=
l
set up 7th City Distribution in order to assist smaller Midwest labels to
get distribution in overseas markets. He also created three new labels - 7t=
h
City, Elevate and Harmonie Park . In 2000, he relocated to Berlin, Germany =
,
and released his first mix CD, "The Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell", on
Tresor Records, followed in 2003 by "The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!"
He since has produced a series of remixes for a diverse range of artists,
includng John Tejada, Pantytec, Akufen and Martin Landsky. He has spent the
last 2 years traveling and DJing around the world, and is currently touring
the U.S. and preparing to hunker down in the studio in the coming year.

Reverb is good. If you're nice to Icon, she'll hella hook you up.
Addictech is technically online, but it's based in SF, and totally
busts ass for Teh Skene. Plus you can get a breakbeat CD which
features a jungle track by ME! on that site. So of course that site
must be Teh Rawk.

http://www.addictech.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=3D935

My track is DJ Soundwave "Fuzzy Ballistics," the "Maja Shook" remix
right after it is better though. I think that's Odeed and Wish? Or
something?

Yes, what were we talking about. Oh, right, ME! Oh wait, no. Record
stores. Right.

BPM is good. They make you do some crate-digging, but they're good.
Skills in Berkeley, well, they've really only got like this tiny tiny
pile of records in the very very corner for breaks. Can't really
recommend them so much. Solid Grooves in San Jo actually had a pretty
great selection last time I was in there, like a thousand times
improved after the move from Santa Clara or wherever, but they were in
transition so who knows whether that's still the case or not. Amobea,
not so good. Primal, Primal hides from me every time I look for it.
I'm serious. it like hides and wears dark sunglasses so I won't
recognize it. wtf.

hmm. yeah.

Marco, whatever on the dissing local stores, but credit where credit
is due, Marco can find records like a fucking bloodhound. Crazy.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] good rekkid stores for breaks in SF?

is that what happened? balls. a lot of stores are doing that now.

I actually think that's the wave of the future. look at Dogs On Acid.
started as a forum, added on a store and a label. people don't hang
out in record stores as much as they used to, and the real purpose of
a record store is to serve as a focal point for a musical community.
if the musical community finds its focal point on the Internet, that's
where the store should be. just logic.

Reverb is good. If you're nice to Icon, she'll hella hook you up.
Addictech is technically online, but it's based in SF, and totally
busts ass for Teh Skene. Plus you can get a breakbeat CD which
features a jungle track by ME! on that site. So of course that site
must be Teh Rawk.

http://www.addictech.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=935

My track is DJ Soundwave "Fuzzy Ballistics," the "Maja Shook" remix
right after it is better though. I think that's Odeed and Wish? Or
something?

Yes, what were we talking about. Oh, right, ME! Oh wait, no. Record
stores. Right.

BPM is good. They make you do some crate-digging, but they're good.
Skills in Berkeley, well, they've really only got like this tiny tiny
pile of records in the very very corner for breaks. Can't really
recommend them so much. Solid Grooves in San Jo actually had a pretty
great selection last time I was in there, like a thousand times
improved after the move from Santa Clara or wherever, but they were in
transition so who knows whether that's still the case or not. Amobea,
not so good. Primal, Primal hides from me every time I look for it.
I'm serious. it like hides and wears dark sunglasses so I won't
recognize it. wtf.

hmm. yeah.

Marco, whatever on the dissing local stores, but credit where credit
is due, Marco can find records like a fucking bloodhound. Crazy.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] good rekkid stores for breaks in SF?

To be honest - I have been to so few record stores that have been able to 
keep current on anything other than house or trance, that I typically never 
shop in stores for my breakbeats anyway. It's always some store in bumfuck 
Egypt that has good records, and I'm not travelling an hour to dig through 
crates for shit I can buy from the relative comfort of my cubicle or on my 
PC at home. Plus, moving towards dj downloads of MP3's - who'd want to go to 
a store for that?

If anyone wants me to do my semi regular posting of online stores that I buy 
from (which is quite a few), say the word...

is that what happened? balls. a lot of stores are doing that now.

I actually think that's the wave of the future. look at Dogs On Acid.
started as a forum, added on a store and a label. people don't hang
out in record stores as much as they used to, and the real purpose of
a record store is to serve as a focal point for a musical community.
if the musical community finds its focal point on the Internet, that's
where the store should be. just logic.

here's my problem - I *love* the idea of buying rekkids and mp3s
online ( and have been doing so exclusively for at least a year)  but
i often find a) i dont get a really good sense for a record from the
tinny low-bitrate clips online stores use and b)  there's just
something about holding a rekkid in your hand.  i *still* have a hard
time associating what a song sounds like to its text name in Final
Scratch.

I hear ya - but I make it a point to search several diff. sites for the same 
samples because I find that the samples differ. Sometimes in tempo, 
sometimes in length, and sometimes (and most importantly) in quality. Then I 
weigh out whether or not the tracks kept it's intrigue - and go from there.

I rarely wind up disappointed that way.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj jen lasher: no more tears

Nice 1 Mary!!! I'm proud of Jen and glad to see her hard work paying off!

It's also really dope to see her give props to Sinestro, as he's one of my 
mian inspirations. I really wish the left coast was familiar with his work, 
because he is truly of the old school DJ ilk.

Sooner or later (if I have to pay for it myself) I will fly him out here to 
drop science on the Bay Area....

ez.

thank you, Marc(0)!  mad thanks and appreciation!  =D

word re: Sinestro!  Sinestro's done SO much to promote dj culture around
here.  i also thought it was very cool of Jen to give him props.  :)

wonderful knowing you're happy out there in the Bay Area, Marc(0), though
you know we miss ya here!

let us know when you're coming home to visit!

happy holidays!

xoxo
love and respect,
mary :)



< Nice 1 Mary!!! I'm proud of Jen and glad to see her hard work paying off!

It's also really dope to see her give props to Sinestro, as he's one of my
mian inspirations. I really wish the left coast was familiar with his work,

because he is truly of the old school DJ ilk.

Sooner or later (if I have to pay for it myself) I will fly him out here to

drop science on the Bay Area....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj jen lasher: no more tears

It's looking like not until sometime in March unless Buzzlife gets off their 
ass and gets more proactive about booking the Dj/Producer Myagi, in which 
case I'll be out when they book him to open for him (w/ Ian as the Mario 
Bros!).

I was hoping to get back this year a 2nd time, but scheduling prohibited 
that.

SOON THOUGH!

Dear SFRaves Community

I am writing to inquire if you or anyone you know is a Zope Guru who might 
be interested in becoming involved with the next generation of the SFRaves 
Calendar Project.

The SFRaves Calendar is located @ 
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/sf/calendar2

More information about Zope is located here: http://www.zope.org

All interested parties should have a solid understanding of and 
development experience with authoring and building applications using the 
Zope language.

Please send responses to karina@hyperreal.org

Alternative solutions are also being considered for the next generation of 
this codebase.  This includes other languages specific to the development 
of applications in a web environment.

Thanks and regards

Karina Powers

I'll be at Tosca tonight. I usually hate the vibe at Mezzanine, but I'm 
hopeful that the music will override the normal sleaziness!

Party and Get On Santa's NICE List
================================================================
====

It's a Win-Win Situation
Come to our HOLIDAY MISTLETOE JAM and rev up your holiday season
to a good start! It is, afterall, the season to be jolly!
Thing is, you can be naughty BUT be nice all at once at our
party.     Impossible, you say?  Try this:  shake it to the the
dirty grooves of Denver's LITTLE MIKE and TY TEK, plus their
cohorts, the TRIBALSOULS crew and a couple of gritty local djs:
JEFFREY ALLEN and WILL SPENCER 'til the break of dawn.     Then,
while you're gettin' your groove on, take comfort in the fact
that part of the proceeds for this here party will go to NEXTAID
a dance-centric organization dedicated to aiding African orphans
affected by the AIDS epidemic.     What better way to get on
Santa's NICE list, eh?     So here are the details:

WHAT: A Holiday Mistletoe Jam
WHERE: Club Six (6th between Market and Mission)
WHEN: Saturday, December 10, 10pm 'til late
DOOR: $10/$7 before 11:00

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj jen lasher: no more tears

OK. This isn't going to help my reputation AT ALL, but why is it that
when I google this chick I see 100 web sites with guys asking why the
links to the Jen Lasher porn video got taken down?

Is this the same Jen Lasher?

http://www.jenlasher.com/albums/album04/cd_cover_flat_2.sized.jpg

you know, half San Francisco is calling me a sex fiend, and the other
half is calling me the violent Geri Dahl. does this girl have an image
consultant? there's the Paris Hilton thing and there's the kung fu
warrior thing, so it's possible that this woman might have an image
consultant, and personally, I need to hire an image consultant,
because I need to work on my image as an artist. at least, this is
what people tell me.

also, does anyone have a link to that video?

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Just a goddamned piece of paper... 

GOP leaders told Bush that his hardcore push to renew the more onerous 
provisions of the act could further alienate conservatives still mad at 
the President from his botched attempt to nominate White House Counsel 
Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court.

"I don't give a goddamn,"; Bush retorted. "I'm the President and the 
Commander-in-Chief. Do it my way."

"Mr. President," one aide in the meeting said. "There is a valid case 
that the provisions in this law undermine the Constitution."

"Stop throwing the Constitution in my face," Bush screamed back. "It's 
just a goddamned piece of paper!

To clarify - Zope is actually an framework. We are also seeking an 
individual who likes to code in ZPT, Python, PHP, MYSQL, Plone and other 
languages that might be used to enhance the SFR Calendar Application.

Please note if you are seeing issues with the current calendar incarnation 
(bugs, errors, etc) please note that I am aware of them and am currently 
in the process of addressing / fixing these issues.


Thanks

Karina

is that what counts for a 'live' show these days?  where was the  
grand piano that was promised?  at no point were both members of  
tosca on the stage at the same time.  less than an hour after they  
started, dorfmeister was playing a gorillaz track, which was actually  
a pretty good remix and had me moving for sure, but also wondering,  
is this his 'three hour dj set' which was supposed to follow the  
'live' show?  45 minutes into the show?  it went downhill from  
there.  i had more fun listening to the new album on the ipod in the  
car on my way back to berkeley.  pretty lame.  not worth my $26.50,  
or the time spent away from studying for finals for that matter.   
anyway, that's my .02.  anybody else have a review?

That was the worst "show" ever.

I'm actually going to write Blasthaus and demand my money back.
 I suggest you do the same.  (email: will@blasthaus.com)

There was no grand piano.  Rupert Huber bored me to tears for
the first 45 minutes on that 1960's synth.  Yes, he was playing
"live", but he sucked.

Dorfmeister didn't even do a laptop performance.  He was
playing dub versions of Tosca's own stuff on CDs, while stupid
Earl Zinger mouthed off at the crowd.  I actually picked my
nose at him.

Horrible.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj jen lasher: no more tears

go internet go!

those speakers in the background in the first video are hella cool.
the rest of it, though,

[OK HERE I DELETED A LOT OF STUFF THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE GOOD
SENSE NOT TO SAY. HOWEVER I AM TOO TIRED TO HIDE MY TRACKS. SO JUST
SKIP ALL THIS CRAP IN CAPS PLEASE.]

god damn, I shouldn't have said that either.

you know what though? the time has come for me to pull a Jen Lasher.
because if this is the best the rave world can do in terms of pr0n,
this and raverporn.com or whatever it was, then I can understand the
pathetic expectations some people had/ve of raver porn in general. so,
I tried to export one of my acid porn DVDs to a net-usable format, but
apparently I am not L337 enough to master Adobe Premiere, so you'll
just have to settle for these screenshots.

dude, whatever. publicity stunt. image consultant. Paris Hilton.
monkey see, monkey do.

#32 on the Billboard chart.

and listen to the track! a guy I grew up with sings opera for a living
worldwide. ok? the man can give you goosebumps with his vocal chords.
and he was doing it when we were 13. fast forward to the modern day,
and Giles foolishly clicks a link and listens to that mp3. suddenly
his ears are bleeding! polka beats with a vocal from a dead cat
possessed by the ghost of Tori Amos! wtf?

I don't know what the fuck is up with that shit, but if you're posting
that, somebody's going to have to say *something*.

and as for that bullshit article, the promoter who's like "her success
is due entirely to talent and hard work" -- at least some of her
present fame comes from fucking Dara and "accidentally" recording it
on video. the only logical implication is that making pornography, for
a woman DJ, is just another form of talent and hard work. THAT
IMPLICATION IS FALSE.

god! so much bullshit I need boots!

I have to point out something: They both had sex. He was holding the camera=
,
there were two people involved. If you try to moralize one, you must do it
to the other.

Anyone who wants to get all high and mighty about this tape: I bet you've
had sex too, so shut up. Recording sex acts doesn't suddenly demoralize and
invalidate them.

Making pornography does take talent and hard work, at least to make good
porn. (A film about fucking is still a film.) That's why there is an over
abundance of shitty "gonzo" style porn that spends a maximum of two days in
post-production. (For laughs, here is a big list of all the things wrong
with it: http://newyork.craigslist.org/about/best/bos/50001396.html )

And that "logical implication" makes no sense. The only logical implication
I can see is that two people fucked and videotaped it, and are unfortunatel=
y
well known enough in some circles that the tape is gossip worthy and made i=
t
onto the net. They aren't the only people to have done this, and I'll bet
you money that outside of any club/rave/electronic music social circles
no-one knows about this nor gives a fuck.

I'll bring you a pamphlet that will explain everything, accompanied by an
outdated educational film. All will be made clear...

In retroscpect I probably should have said: I bet you have sex too.

OK, look, just slow down and chill out.

you posted a URL begging for the type of porn I create and a rant
accusing me of being anti-porn in the same e-mail.

since you missed it, here's the link again.

my porn.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj jen lasher: no more tears

ps, upset person, it isn't the porn that bugged me, it's just that
somebody made the mistake of telling me not to talk about something.
I've actually spent hours and hours and hours re-editing porn and
putting digital effects on it because a girlfriend and I once made the
mistake of watching bad porn together on psychedelics. that's why it's
called "acid porn." you can take bad porn under normal circumstances,
but not on psychedelics. (trust me on this one.)

acid porn here:

That wasn't really a personal response to what you said. I've heard this
video talked about before and I used a couple of things you said as a
launchpad for some things I thought needed to be said. Anytime I've heard
this mentioned, it's usually in a condescending tone and it bugs me.

Also, not once did I personally address you in that e-mail. What I said was
for a general audience.

Subject: [sfraves] Weekend Review

Friday Night - Modified :)

It was a really Good night!  I mean.. honestly, I seriously wasn't even
thinkin' about goin' out like all day 'cause OK.. I'm slakin n my current
class.. ditchin' my 1 night a week class on Wed 2 go 2 an art show wasn't
the smartest thing 2 do 'cuase I was like mentally fuxed up 4 some
reason... but la la la.. Hello 2Day... Adrianna persuaded me.. so i went
:)  Love U Girl!

When we got 2 the Modi-sindig.. it was like sooo totally Mondo Hella
Modi-Dope!  :)  Like I saw Groovers & ain't seen in like a loooooong
time.. so it was Wicked... throughout the night, there was House, Jungle,
Breaks, Breakcore, & Hardcore!  I danced my ass of in both rooms & I did
get "proper mashed" that night... LoL... yeah... having an excuse  havin a
mentally fuckedup weak is always a good reason 2 get fucked up.. LoL..
Hello2day.. even is dancing & Groovy people is all i need.. but all the
extras were oooooooh my gooosh... oh yeah... LOLOLMAO! :)

Party got broken up like an hour early 'cause some Oakland hood rats
decided it be fun to go around piching girls asses, bumping in2 people
while there were standing or dacning, and just being these Oakland ghetto
mondo drama thugs... 3 fights broke out, from what i saw, & me & Mz. Kitty
were like outta there! LoL

Saturday NIght: Drive & Rhythm Method

So I get down 2 Berk & again, hook up w/ Mz Kitty Litter.. we trek down 2
SOMA.. LoL.. as soon as we got walked over 2 the corner of Folsum & 9th...
Ranger's walki' down the street yellin' something.. YAAAAAAAAAY!!!  But b4
entering Shadow 4 some jungle... me & Ranger head over 2 Club 6 for Drive
shindig MissleToe Jam (I"ve always hated that name for a Christmas
party).. I mean.. ok.. so like we get in there... Proggy HOuse is goin' on
downstairs.... some like Chicago HOuse up stairs.. Dope!  Get downstairs..
Wil & ummm... ?Jack? (not Triumph) was spinning (well.. if Jack was his
name.. i couldn't hear down there... it Wicked... I mean... it was still
early there.. but the night was packin' in good so far...

I wanted to go 2 The Drive thingie mainly 'cause the headlining DJ  was Ty
Tek from Denver.. & like me & him have all out Homegirl Lauren (aka Ms
Vicious) in common & I wanted 2 ask him about her... but yeah man.. he's a
Dope DJ.. i heard his stuff like b4.. but didn't really stay there 4 his
set... dud catch up w/ Wil (Yaya, he misses u 2)... oh yeah.. bumped in2
like some Homies while there.. so that was also fun.. i was also told that
Mr Bamdon was gonna show up... but i kinda didn't hang out there 2 long
after a lil' dancey dancey...

Anywaze.. Ranger & I kinda like split up @ Club 6.. he kinda ditched me
(jk.. Love U Ranger) & well.. i knew that Evol Intent was like spinning
already @ Shadow.. so i went back there... OK... like 4 the 1st hour @
Rhythm Method i was there... oh yeah.. Evol Intent was on already spinning
& started out like playin' some liquidie kinda dubby stuff i guess... but
i dunno.. the vibe was kinda weird.. I felt all kindza like mixed... & i
dunno... but it took a while 2 settle in 'til i felt like right... or

Well duh.  Growing up in Berkeley in the 70s does have
some educational advantages I'm finding.  

FWIW just try watching Deep Throat or even just
listening to the soundtrack when you are tripping. 
You won't even be able to listen to the entire song on
the opening credits without running outside to find a
tree to hug or something.  

Really. Try it yerself...

Peter

P.S For those of you who are too young to even know
about this movie:

even bad porn is good porn on psychedelics.  Making porn on psychedelics is
pretty cool too.

The best porn to watch on lots of acid is.....*drum roll*

Caligula

There is nothing better then lots of sex, blood and an insane tyrannical
roman emporer.  My life long dream is to build a sex boat and sail it acros=
s
the atlantic.

I'm still trying to determine if i was warped before or after Caligula on 1=
0
hits of acid.

Best movie to follow up Caligula on said night, is LA Blue Girl 2.

Oh hell no. Caligula? Are you out of your mind? That movie is
horrible. It's a crime against humanity. It's a crime against
Vogonity! (And that movie was made by Vogons, you know.)

Hey asshat - she's a friend of mine, and I guarantee it wasn't a publicity 
stunt. Her stupid ex boyfriend stole the vid and circulated it, causing all 
sorts of drama.

Now grow up and LEAVE IT BE.

#32 on the Billboard chart.

and listen to the track! a guy I grew up with sings opera for a living
worldwide. ok? the man can give you goosebumps with his vocal chords.
and he was doing it when we were 13. fast forward to the modern day,
and Giles foolishly clicks a link and listens to that mp3. suddenly
his ears are bleeding! polka beats with a vocal from a dead cat
possessed by the ghost of Tori Amos! wtf?

I don't know what the fuck is up with that shit, but if you're posting
that, somebody's going to have to say *something*.

and as for that bullshit article, the promoter who's like "her success
is due entirely to talent and hard work" -- at least some of her
present fame comes from fucking Dara and "accidentally" recording it
on video. the only logical implication is that making pornography, for
a woman DJ, is just another form of talent and hard work. THAT
IMPLICATION IS FALSE.

god! so much bullshit I need boots!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj jen lasher: no more tears

She did vox on a track called "Different Day" on DJ Icey's Different Day cd:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008A7PS/qid=1134410005/sr=8-4/ref=pd_bbs_4/102-2318549-3244960?v=glance&s=music&n=507846

She also did a track called "Rain" on Icey's label, just released a full 
length CD w/ Baby Anne:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AP2Z9O/qid%3D1134410138/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/102-2318549-3244960

Yadda yadda...

Not exactly my favorite type of breakbeats, but Jen is a sweet girl whom 
I've known for a long time. She made the mistake of dating some high profile 
DJ's here and there - and as a result people like to toss out all sorts of 
BS stories about how she jump started her career that way, etc. etc. 
Personally I think people just hate on her cuz they're jealous little 
bitches.

I heard it was going to be released on DVD and she was going to make a

I'm not trying to cause trouble, I'm just telling you what I heard.

plur!

I admit it, I'm jealous. I'd love to dress up in a garter belt and
swing around a katana. That would be hella fun.

Pretty weird to say that dating high-profile DJs is a mistake, though.
Letting them turn on their video cameras, I can see that's a mistake,
but dating them in the first place?

Who was the ex-bf who posted the video? Do you know it was really him?
Cause that's pretty low.

Well you're being a gossipy little bitch, and it's pretty weak. You're 
relying on a Florida Breaks board (of all things) to get accurate 
information.

If you wanna know the real deal - why don't you go to the source instead of 
relying on other people's "information".

When you assume...well, you get the point.

Now seriously - drop it.

Excuse me. I am a law-abiding citizen. I am a nice guy. I have never
ever tried to cause trouble. I have never heard any suggestion more
ridiculous than the suggestion that "Repeating unconfirmed gossip is
trying to cause trouble." I am simply being a good citizen, and
endeavoring to keep my fellow community members well-informed on
current events.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj jen lasher: no more tears

His name is Jathan Collum, and yes I know him, and I'm pretty fucking 
disappointed he would stoop so low. Especially seeing as how they had 
already been broken up over 2 years before he did that.

And I wouldn't assume I knew it was him if he wouldn't have posted stuff 
about it on some DC listservs that I lurk on. It caused a whole lot of 
uneccesary drama - even *I* was accused of circulating the videos at one 
point. Granted, I have SEEN them - because quite frankly I didn't believe it 
was who it was supposed to be. But I didn't save them, deleted them 
immediately and left it at that.

plur!

I admit it, I'm jealous. I'd love to dress up in a garter belt and
swing around a katana. That would be hella fun.

Pretty weird to say that dating high-profile DJs is a mistake, though.
Letting them turn on their video cameras, I can see that's a mistake,
but dating them in the first place?

Who was the ex-bf who posted the video? Do you know it was really him?
Cause that's pretty low.

I'm not the source of that. Did I make a video with someone? NO.

So if you wanna know the story behind it - go ask her. If you can't - shut

No, I said did you know it was him. Different question.

He posted stuff about it? Like admitted doing to it?

I mean I'm sorry to hear there was a whole bunch of drama, but drama's
drama. If you can't handle drama, you don't belong on stage. You go
into the rave scene expecting to live a drama-free existence, the only
way that can happen is if nobody realizes you're there.

You're just making it seem worse than it is, dude, swearing at me and
calling me names and refusing to talk about it. How many porn stars
you think I know? You're supposed to pimp it, man. Shit.

Alright, give me her e-mail then, I'll ask her.

I made a video with someone. I figure just about everybody's made a
video with somebody at this point. I mean wtf, digital cameras are
selling in the millions. some people are buying them so they can
photograph weddings and bar mitzvahs, and the rest of us are up to
mischief. ^_^

Just because you're in any "scene" doesn't mean you're automatically due 
drama. That's BS. That's a totally "Hollywood" mentality. Worse yet, it's a 
juvenile mentality.

So to get this done and over with - YES, he admitted to doing it.

Are you happy now? No - I'm sure you're not, but I'm not discussing this any 
further. Once again, if you really wanna know what's what - ASK JEN. If you 
don't have the balls to do that, you don't really deserve to know what the 
truth is.

this is a new phenomena. this is a bullshit statement. has the scene changed this much over the years? so much for taking care of your peers. what's happened?

If you can't handle drama, you don't belong on stage. You go
into the rave scene expecting to live a drama-free existence, the only
way that can happen is if nobody realizes you're there.

Hot damn!

I just wanted to give a quick thanks and mini-review of "QUALITY BURL", =
the party I spun at on Friday night.=20

1st off - big props to the crew for all the revamps they made of the =
venue. It looked fantastic!!! Sound was MUCH better then last time I was =
in there too. I was VERY impressed with the amount of work that had gone =
into the place.

The party was pretty damn off the chain. I heard a ton of reaalllllly =
good music in there. Ill-D the DJ, Hyjinx, Kris Kent, Alain Octavo - =
they ALL threw down bangin' ass sets.I never caught the names of the =
DJ's that kept dropping jungle amidst the hardcore, but they were pretty =
decent as well.=20

Saw a lot of SFR heads out and about, and met quite a few really cool =
folks as well. It was a really fun way to spend my Friday night for =
sure.

Special thanks to Jon (Hyjinx) and Chris (Element) for giving me the =
opportunity to play. I had a blast, and my services are yours, free of =
charge, any time you need them!!!!=20

Can't wait for the next soiree!!!

~Marc(O)

I love filters because, in lieu of reading a messagee, clicking a link and

:)

Gmail rocks my socks too though :)

Searching archives of data on the internet resulted in some internet

http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.07/net_surf.html?pg=5

Wired  - On the Newstands Now (Then)
Issue 2.07 | July 1994

Rec.Rave

Attention surf-ravers! All you ever wanted to know about hardcore, 
ambient, jungle beat, smart drinks, and amp hacks is yours for the picking 
from alt.rave. This is a chockablock gold mine, but be prepared for a 
fistful of Net.flyers from the UK, Belgium, San Francisco, and every other 
techno Mecca. (Hey -- a promoter is a promoter is a promoter....) Also 
catering to your techno-groove thang are the SFRaves Mailing List and 
Calendar. The calendar offers a complete listing of weekly and monthly 
events in Northern California. The list is a high-traffic dialogue of rave 
reviews (ar ar) and posts about upcoming gatherings. The address for 
subscribing and unsubscribing to the list and the calendar are the same -- 
send e-mail to majordomo@sfraves.stanford.edu. The subscriber should type 
(in the body of the message) the line subscribe sfraves for the main list, 
or subscribe sfraves-calendar for the calendar-only list. Subscribers to 
the main list automatically get the calendar, so they need not subscribe 
to both. E-mail Brian Behlendorf (http://wired.com/~brian/) at 
sfraves-owner@sfraves.stanford.edu with specific questions and be sure to 
check out the Web site. Rave down!

Come to arizona. That's how the whole scene is - Hence why I'm not
involved with it.

I got tired of the drama and bullshit, and all the retarded people, so
my girlfriend and I simply quit.

here's a really interesting quote.  i'll try to make this 'really  
interesting quote' week.  but my brain is still on butterfly mode, so  
we'll see how far i get!

--

"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the  
blood of patriots and tyrants. ... God forbid we should ever be  
twenty years without such a rebellion; what country can preserve its  
liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their  
people preserve the spirit of resistance?  Let them take arms."

Subject: [sfraves] ok whatever

I'm tired of all this arguing. I'm a lover, not a fighter. Or at
least, I'm a muppetfucker, not a fighter. So I officially declare
December 12th to be No More Stupid Fighting Day. From this day forth,
I shall be peaceful on sfraves. Let 12/12 live in memory, for verily
doth it be mnemonic.

*On the Dead and Dying, Part 2: Arnold's Choice*:
Man, the Rude Pundit wants Arnold Schwarzenegger 
<http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0088247/Terminator_PUB01.jpg> to be in 
charge of all decisions of life or death. He wants that deep thinkin' 
demi-Nazi to walk from cell to cell at San Quentin and mark a chalk X 
outside each door. Because Arnold Schwarzenegger 
<http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0093773/6098_16_12.jpg> is just who we 
all want tellin' us who should live or die, who deserves mercy and who 
deserves death. Goddamn, what an easy world it'll be havin' Arnold 
Schwarzenegger <http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0088944/6030_16_3.JPG> 
make all those decisions.

Fuck, let's not limit Arnold Schwarzenegger 
<http://webfantasy.info/Arnold_Schwarzenegger/Images/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_Conan_01.jpg> 
to the executable on death row; send Arnold Schwarzenegger 
<http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0111503/6767_3_1.jpg> into hospitals so 
he can give the thumbs up or thumbs down to each person on life support. 
The Rude Pundit wants us to entrust Arnold Schwarzenegger 
<http://www.angelfire.com/celeb/Schwarzenegger/images/arnie03.jpg> with 
that shit. Let's not stop with amendin' the Constitution so Arnold can 
lead us all. The Rude Pundit wants Arnold Schwarzenegger 
<http://www.angelfire.com/celeb/Schwarzenegger/images/arnie01.jpg> on 
the left hand of God, Jesus, Allah, who the fuck ever, sayin' to that 
big ass deity where to toss lightnin', where to unleash a plague, where 
to make the waters rise, and where to make the land dry out.

'Cause no one knows how to judge the worth of a soul like Arnold 
Schwarzenegger <http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0110216/1-15.jpg>, man. 
No one could tell whether or not someone's more valuable dead than 
alive, no one can say how many lives will be saved if Stanley "Tookie" 
Williams had been allowed to live 
<http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/wireStory?id=1400266>, no one is 
full of unbiased, apolitical consideration more than Arnold Fuckin' 
Schwarzenegger <http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0420678/electionnight.jpg>.

Arnold Fuckin' Schwarzenegger? Ya gotta be fuckin' kiddin'. Who's been 
indirectly responsible for more violence since the early 1980s, Tookie 
or the Terminator 
<http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/violence/violence_entertainment.cfm>? 
Tough question, no?

For, if nothing else, the Williams case has laid clear the absurdity of 
the governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger. If you spend your life acting 
like an amoral, gun-firing buffoon, why should anyone expect you to act 
differently as the governor? That would require an act of clemency by 
the voting public, that might require you to say you wanted to redeem 
yourself for your past sins.

Meanwhile, last night, the Rude Pundit flipped between CNN and Fox 
"News" to watch coverage of the execution of Stanley Williams. CNN went 
with the more intellectually stimulating CNN International (motto: Other 
countries are smarter than the United States, and we prove it every day) 
for its reporting, and Fox went with the usual Murdoch spooge buckets.

A couple of brief observations: whoever the pro-death penalty guy on 
CNNi was, he was one creepy motherfucker, speaking in perfectly even 
tones about the need for "justice," and apocalyptically quoting the 
Bible. When confronted by the anchor (possibly Todd Benjamin) with the 
notion of turning the other cheek, creepy pro-death guy calmly short 
circuited as he tried to shoehorn that bromide into his kill 'em all 
mentality. Then he took out a cute little lamb and ate it alive. Truly 
stunning TV for 3 a.m.

Fox "News" took every opportunity, which meant every time someone opened 
his or her mouth, to talk about Williams' murder conviction, the 
victims' families, or the Crips. Fox had a reporter witnessing the 
execution. He was roughly the tenth media witness to speak, and the 
first to say that Williams had stared at the media section as if trying 
to "intimidate" them. Fox stuck to the script, man, of Tookie the 
monster, as if to grant clemency meant that Williams would be set free 
to rape white children, not simply live out his life in prison without 
parole.

And the most disheartening thing of all was how little was mentioned, in 
the cruel march to the death chamber, of how the ex-wife of one of 
Williams' alleged victims, Albert Owens (whose family is entirely 
fucked-up in conflict 
<http://www.modbee.com/local/v-dp_morning/story/11566867p-12300721c.html>over 
the execution), called <http://www.naacp.org/news/2005/2005-12-09.html> 
for support of Williams' efforts to redeem himself for his gang-building 
past: "I, Linda Owens want to build upon Mr. Williams' peace initiative. 
I invite Mr. Williams to join me in sending a message to all communities 
that we should all unite in peace. This position of peace would honor my 
husband's memory and Mr. Williams work."

A call for peace to honor the dead? What fuckin' country does Linda 
Owens think she's living in? Not in George Bush's America, where more 
must die in Iraq to make sure the dead are honored. And certainly not in 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's California.

I quit going to most parties in '94. the day i heard house music in a public shoe store on haight street was the day i knew the scene was starting a downward spiral. there wasn't much attitude back then. every once in a while i will go to a party but i am pretty picky. so no, the parties i go to i don't have to deal with rave drama. this scene has been a part of my life for over 15 years now but it is just one part of my life. it doesn't define who i am therefore there is no reason for drama.

on a messageboard i'm on he was identified as "jason" but after i
interviewed Jen she told me off the record who it was and i was really sad
to realize i know the guy.  it was really him.  i was really sad that he
could have gotten  himself to such a state where he could do such a thing,
and i was really sad also because i believe that what goes around comes
around.  mary :(

Subject: [sfraves] rave ban provokes rioting in rennes, france





http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article332471.ece

Ravers clash with French police after party ban

 By John Lichfield in Paris
Published: 12 December 2005

More than 500 people rioted for 12 hours in the centre of Rennes, the
capital of Brittany, to protest at the banning of a rave party.

They smashed shop windows, burned dustbins and showered police with pav=
ing
stones and bottles. Two policemen were hurt and 30 people arrested. Tea=
r
gas and water cannon were used to sweep the last of the rioters off the=

streets just before dawn yesterday.

The party, on the fringe of the Transmusicales rock festival, had been
authorised by the mayor of Rennes, who provided a field on the edge of =
the
city. The all-night, open-air dance and music event had been banned on
Tuesday by Bernadette Malgorn, the prefect - or senior national governm=
ent
administrator - for Brittany. She complained the likely number of teufe=
urs,
or ravers, was a threat to public safety.

The violence began on Saturday afternoon when youths marched through Re=
nnes
chanting "freedom" and "we want a field". Confrontations with riot poli=
ce
turned into running battles. The violence came a month after riots by y=
oung
people in poor suburbs of French cities. On this occasion, the rioters =
were
mostly middle-class and from universities in Rennes and other parts of
France.

The socialist mayor of Rennes, Edmond Herv=E9, accused the prefect of
provoking the violence. "The ban was a mistake and we've suffered the
consequences," he said. The field was safe and hosted a rave three year=
s
ago, he said.

Mme Malgorn said there was "enormous uncertainty" about the possible
numbers of ravers. The organisers had promised 10,000 but the authoriti=
es
calculated 30,000 might turn up.

More than 500 people rioted for 12 hours in the centre of Rennes, the
capital of Brittany, to protest at the banning of a rave party.

They smashed shop windows, burned dustbins and showered police with pav=
ing
stones and bottles. Two policemen were hurt and 30 people arrested. Tea=
r
gas and water cannon were used to sweep the last of the rioters off the=

streets just before dawn yesterday.

The party, on the fringe of the Transmusicales rock festival, had been
authorised by the mayor of Rennes, who provided a field on the edge of =
the
city. The all-night, open-air dance and music event had been banned on
Tuesday by Bernadette Malgorn, the prefect - or senior national governm=

Subject: NRR: Re: [sfraves] On the Dead and Dying, Part 2: Arnold's Choice:
 ***WARNING GRAPHIC***

It was pretty sickening to have the governator cite the dedications in 
Tookie's book as evidence that he hasn't redeemed himself.  Almost all 
of those cited were people of color.  Here's a snippet from 
http://www.counterpunch.org/gasper12132005.html

"In the days leading up to the execution, new evidence that Stan was 
framed emerged and was simply ignored. Having dismissed questions about 
the conviction, the Governor then concludes that since Stan will not 
apologize for crimes he has always denied committing, "there can be no 
redemption."

Even more outrageous, however, is the following passage:

"The dedication of Williams' book "Life in Prison" casts significant 
doubt on his personal redemption. This book was published in 1998, 
several years after Williams' claimed redemptive experience. 
Specifically, the book is dedicated to "Nelson Mandela, Angela Davis, 
Malcolm X, Assata Shakur, Geronimo Ji Jaga Pratt, Ramona Africa, John 
Africa, Leonard Peltier, Dhoruba Al-Mujahid, George Jackson, Mumia 
Abu-Jamal, and the countless other men, women, and youths who have to 
endure the hellish oppression of living behind bars." The mix of 
individuals on this list is curious. Most have violent pasts and some 
have been convicted of committing heinous murders, including the killing 
of law enforcement.

But the inclusion of George Jackson on this list defies reason and is a 
significant indicator that Williams is not reformed and that he still 
sees violence and lawlessness as a legitimate means to address societal 
problems."


Of those convicted of "committing heinous murders" on this list, two 
(Geronimo Ji Jaga Pratt and Dhoruba Al-Mujahid) were later found to have 
been wrongfully convicted after serving a combined forty-six years 
behind bars, and four (Assata Shakur, John Africa, Leonard Peltier and 
Mumia Abu-Jamal) have always proclaimed their innocence and are widely 
believed to have been framed. George Jackson, who Schwarzenegger 
apparently regards as the epitome of "violence and lawlessness" was 
convicted of stealing $71 in 1960 at the age of 18, sentenced to an 
indeterminate sentence of 1 year to life, became a Black Panther and 
political leader in prison (which Schwarzenegger equates with forming a 
gang), charged but never convicted of killing a prison guard, and 
assassinated by guards in 1971."


Who do you suppose is responsible for inciding more violence, Tookie or 
The Terminator?


Evidence Points to Frame-Up in Tookie Williams Case
Commentary, Clive Leeman,
New America Media, Dec 07, 2005

Editor's Note: Focusing on Stanley "Tookie" Williams' good works while 
on death row misses the inconsistencies, lack of physical evidence and 
questionable stories spun by informants that ultimately convicted him, 
says the writer, who calls for a death penalty moratorium.

OJAI, Calif.--If Stanley Tookie Williams is executed on Tuesday, Dec. 
13, poisoned to death by the State of California, his fame will have 
doomed him. We may well have killed an innocent man without even 
realizing it.

On the other hand, if Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger grants clemency to 
Williams because he has rehabilitated himself, his fame will have saved 
him, and the crucial question of his innocence will simply fade away.

At a time when more and more Americans are turning against the death 
penalty because of increasing evidence that innocent people have been 
executed, we have allowed ourselves to be so bedazzled by the celebrity 
hype surrounding the Tookie Williams case that one important truth has 
been ignored: Stanley Williams may be innocent of the crimes for which 
he was convicted.

Was Williams truly proven "guilty beyond a reasonable doubt"? A careful 
reading of attorney Verna Wefald's 88-page appeal to the California 
Supreme Court to reopen Williams' case strongly suggests that Tookie was 
framed and railroaded in a trial riddled with inconsistencies, 
contradictions, lack of physical evidence and false stories spun by a 
parade of informers trying to save their own necks.

As a founder of the Crips gang, Williams was assumed to be guilty before 
he was even charged with four murders. He was the Black Man Rampant, the 
Black Bogeyman, the Bigger Thomas of South Central Los Angeles. Williams 
was convicted by his notoriety, not by the evidence.

According to Wefald and federal courts that reviewed Williams' case, 
Williams' 1981 trial for the murder of Albert Owens, a convenience store 
clerk in Whittier, and Los Angeles motel owners Yen-I Yang, Tsai-Shaic 
Yang and their daughter, Yee Chen Lin was based on flimsy circumstantial 
evidence; the fabricated testimony of five informants having "incentives 
to lie in order to obtain leniency from the state...." (according to the 
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals); and the perjury of at least one police 
officer.

Physical evidence such as fingerprints and a bloody boot-print could not 
be traced to Williams.

Only one shotgun shell was found at the motel. It ostensibly came from a 
shotgun purchased legally five years before by Williams, but the gun 
itself was actually found under the bed of informants James Garrett and 
his wife, Ester. The Browning shotgun shell was sold at only two local 
stores, one of which, a Big Five, had been robbed of guns and ammunition 
by Garrett the year before.

The Garretts were both being investigated for the murder of their crime 
partner, Gregory Wilbon. This investigation was dropped, according to 
Wefald, after they testified that Williams "volunteered" a confession to 
them.

Deputy Gilbert Gwaltney perjured himself when he supported Garrett by 
testifying that the informant had a sound alibi at the time his crime 
partner Wilbon was murdered. Wilbon's body was so badly decomposed, 
Williams' lawyers write, that it was impossible to establish a time of 
death and thus impossible to establish an alibi.

Another informant also claimed that Williams had "volunteered" a 
confession to him -- but only after a police officer had left the police 
file on Williams overnight in the informant's cell for him to read 
before he testified the next day, according to Wefald.

The prosecutor, who had already been censured twice by the California 
Supreme Court for discriminatory behavior, threw three African-Americans 
off the jury, leaving a majority-white jury with few or no blacks (at 
least one juror's racial identity is in dispute).

Wefald's appeal was turned down by the California Supreme Court on Nov. 
30 by a 4-2 vote. This is not uncommon, especially in cases which do not 
involve DNA evidence.

Every appeal to the California Supreme Court made by wrongfully 
convicted prisoner Gloria Killean was routinely denied for 16 years, 
until a federal court overturned her life sentence. And Thomas Goldstein 
filed repeated appeals to the court for 24 years before being exonerated 
by a federal court.

And the California Supreme Court's divided vote "indicates the 
seriousness of the issues that were raised by the motion," Williams' 
attorney Jonathan Harris said.

But the railroading never ceases. The moment the Dec. 13 execution date 
was announced last month, authorities rushed Williams to the holding 
cell next to the death chamber, three weeks before the usual holding 
period begins.

Now the ultimate humiliation is being required of Tookie Williams. Like 
the innocent women at the Salem witch trials, he is being told he should 
confess in order to save his own life, a Catch-22 if ever there was one. 
This he refuses to do. He says he will not compromise his dignity and 
integrity, the most powerful and precious forces in his life today.

One of the most compelling arguments against the death penalty is that 
we inevitably kill innocent people. Britain abolished capital punishment 
in 1965 after Timothy Evans, hanged for strangling his young daughter, 
was later found to be innocent.

Now, new developments like DNA evidence are leading to the release of 
significant numbers of innocent people from death rows and prisons 
across the United States, and support for the death penalty is steadily 
declining.

In 2000, the same year that Illinois Governor George Ryan declared a 
moratorium on executions in his state, a California Field Poll showed 
that 73 percent of Californians supported a similar moratorium. The 
number is probably higher today.

Instead of spending hours agonizing over Tookie Williams' fate (and his 
own political future), Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger should do the right 
thing and suspend the executions of all 637 death row inmates 
immediately.

It is relevent by the fact that a jury found this man guilty of
killing people, including the woman in the picture. This man had a
history of crime and immorality.

If that was your soulmate, and you knew I had done that to her, would
you care about me and my future the same as you care about about his?

Personally I would want anyone capable of something so disgusting to
be unable to ever do it again and that is only possible through death.

Untrue - he's alone on death row. Can't kill anyone in a cell by yourself 
except yourself. Even if his term was moved to life in prison w/o 
possibility of parole, he wouldn't be moved into general populace, and even 
if he did - he's behind bars FOREVER. You mean being locked up FOREVER 
doesn't stop him from killing innocent folks again?

Um - yea.

So who pays to support his food, medications, electricity, water...
That costs Money. Money costs lives. So People are dying to keep him
sitting in jail.  That money could be better spent keeping moral
people alive.

That costs Money. Money costs lives. So People are dying to keep him

Life inprisonment is cheaper than the cost a capital punishment case. Look

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Lick The DJ on An Epiphany Of Sound thur.

Hey folks,
This thursday I promise not to let any hangups about money cloud my 
judgement as to what's fun and moral (or maybe a little immoral. ;) ) 
(Yeah, I'm no Libertarian. :) ) Instead, I'll be bringing you someone 
who prefers his tracks with a good acid line, Lick The DJ.

Lick The DJ has been hanging with the likes of FnF, so you know he knows 
his acid lines.  He's also part of Lost Tribe (the Sweet parties) and 
he's part of Lick The Micron (a tagteam duo with Micron.)  Peep him at 
http://www.lickthedj.com to find out more.

The main thing is that you tune in to the show this Thur.  You can 
expect to hear things in the tech-house, house and techno realms, mainly 
with that good acid line!!  We're at 90.1 FM and online at 
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Namaste.

One thing I'd like to say to this:

I understand that under some circumstances, the law is wrong when it
comes to capital punishment. Regardless of whether or not he redeemed
himself, he was still a bad, bad man.

When you do something, you are to take responsibility for your
actions. He was a drug dealer, a founding member of the crips, and
probably did things much worse than the actions he was found guilty
of, regardless of whether he was actually guilty of those crimes he
was convicted of or not.

That's like saying that hitler was not guilty of crimes against
humanity, just because he didn't physically pull the trigger.

Anyhoo, as much as I'd want to think that the guy is innocent of those
crimes, the thought in the back of my head that he most likely did
much worse things, and that the organization he started has done
terrible things, nearly tearing LA apart, makes me really go against
saving this man's life.

I dunno, maybe I'm just jaded with my outsider views on the whole
situation. Maybe he was really reformed. No matter what, what's done
is done, and my life will go on. My life is unaffected by his death.

Or maybe you're just a white guy from the burbs seeing only one side of the 
coin.

Not a diss on you man - but very few people actually take any REAL time even 
ATTEMPTING to think of the environment folks like that come out of. Can they 
rise above that? YES. But some (like in Tookie's case) may not get that 
chance til after they've already made a serious mistake. Does that make them 
any less worthy of of life? I mean - the guy has obviously turned a corner 
and found ways to give back to the community he helped damage. That shows 
remorse on many levels. Correct me if I'm wrong, but prison is SUPPOSED to 
rehabilitate, not be a holding pen for people on the way to the slaughter.

When you reduce people's lives to nothing more than cattle in a 
slaughterhouse, you are playing god.

One thing I'd like to say to this:

I understand that under some circumstances, the law is wrong when it
comes to capital punishment. Regardless of whether or not he redeemed
himself, he was still a bad, bad man.

When you do something, you are to take responsibility for your
actions. He was a drug dealer, a founding member of the crips, and
probably did things much worse than the actions he was found guilty
of, regardless of whether he was actually guilty of those crimes he
was convicted of or not.

That's like saying that hitler was not guilty of crimes against
humanity, just because he didn't physically pull the trigger.

Anyhoo, as much as I'd want to think that the guy is innocent of those
crimes, the thought in the back of my head that he most likely did
much worse things, and that the organization he started has done
terrible things, nearly tearing LA apart, makes me really go against
saving this man's life.

I dunno, maybe I'm just jaded with my outsider views on the whole
situation. Maybe he was really reformed. No matter what, what's done
is done, and my life will go on. My life is unaffected by his death.

That is so irrelevent. Every single one of us grew up with some
hardship in some form or another. It's how you overcome that hardship
and what you make of yourself that counts. So many people love to
follow the racist Malcolm X'es footsteps into blaming someone else so
much that they forget about their personal responsibility.

Yes. You can choose to overcome. Yes yours is harder then others.

MAN WAS NOT CREATED EQUAL and EQUAL TALENT AND HARD WORK ALWAYS
DESERVES EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES.

That is so irrelevent. Every single one of us grew up with some
hardship in some form or another. It's how you overcome that hardship
and what you make of yourself that counts. So many people love to
follow the racist Malcolm X'es footsteps into blaming someone else so
much that they forget about their personal responsibility.

Yes. You can choose to overcome. Yes yours is harder then others.

MAN WAS NOT CREATED EQUAL and EQUAL TALENT AND HARD WORK ALWAYS
DESERVES EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES.

Just to play devils advocate here.

Just cause he wrote some childrens books and did all this anti-gang crap
after the fact doesn't necessarily mean he was rehabilitated or turned a
corner.  Maybe...who knows.

But then again can't some just spew forth what is wanted from them just to
get something?  It's like the guy who cheats on his girlfriend or wife and
then says I'm sorry and does anything he can to apologize to her, even
though he's not sorry.  Or like the book smart people who can go into class
read a bunch of information and then regurgitate that info back onto a piec=
e
of paper and get an A.  Does it mean they really know what they're doing?
no...just shows they know how to give what is expected of them.

I'm not saying that he wasn't sorry for what he did or turned himself aroun=
d
or anything, but i'm just saying just cause you do some bad shit and then
some good shit doesn't mean you're not gonna do bad shit again.

If you're not willing to do the time...don't do the crime.  I personally
think it should be eye for an eye.  I bet if we adheared to that rule a lot
more, there'd be less crime (I could be wrong, only way to know is to try
it)  You shoot someone in the face with a shotgun...you get shot in the fac=
e
with a shotgun.  I also think lethal injection is the pussy man's death
sentence.  If you're being put to death for violent crimes you should feel
serious pain and remorse before you die.  Put em in the gas chamber, they
get a few minutes to choke to death and die painfully to think about what
they did.  What good will it do them after they die?  Or what good will it
do to society after they die?  None...but if our going to rape and beat a
girl to death or something, then you should die a nice painful death.  Mayb=
e
if this whole reencarnation thing is true, they'll remember that in their
next life.

However as the Bloodhound Gang has told us, if you got the crime, we got th=

time.

I understand the environment he came from, and regardless of what you
think, his actions  were still wrong. He got the sentence for the
crime he commited, and it was carried out.

When you kill someone, you're prematurely ending their lives. When you
rape someone, you're crushing their souls. When you turn someone into
a junkie, you're frying their brain.
Doesn't that also sound as though you're playing god?

or you start a war that kills thousands people you die. sounds good to me. let's get bush in a death chair.

Just cause he wrote some childrens books and did all this anti-gang crap
after the fact doesn't necessarily mean he was rehabilitated or turned a
corner.  Maybe...who knows.

But then again can't some just spew forth what is wanted from them just to
get something?  It's like the guy who cheats on his girlfriend or wife and
then says I'm sorry and does anything he can to apologize to her, even
though he's not sorry.  Or like the book smart people who can go into class
read a bunch of information and then regurgitate that info back onto a piece
of paper and get an A.  Does it mean they really know what they're doing?
no...just shows they know how to give what is expected of them.

I'm not saying that he wasn't sorry for what he did or turned himself around
or anything, but i'm just saying just cause you do some bad shit and then
some good shit doesn't mean you're not gonna do bad shit again.

If you're not willing to do the time...don't do the crime.  I personally
think it should be eye for an eye.  I bet if we adheared to that rule a lot
more, there'd be less crime (I could be wrong, only way to know is to try
it)  You shoot someone in the face with a shotgun...you get shot in the face
with a shotgun.  I also think lethal injection is the pussy man's death
sentence.  If you're being put to death for violent crimes you should feel
serious pain and remorse before you die.  Put em in the gas chamber, they
get a few minutes to choke to death and die painfully to think about what
they did.  What good will it do them after they die?  Or what good will it
do to society after they die?  None...but if our going to rape and beat a
girl to death or something, then you should die a nice painful death.  Maybe
if this whole reencarnation thing is true, they'll remember that in their
next life.

However as the Bloodhound Gang has told us, if you got the crime, we got the
time.

Subject: Re: NRR: Re: [sfraves] On the Dead and Dying, Part 2: Arnold's Choice: ***WARNING GRAPHIC***

I just think that the system is archaic and it doesn't work the way it is 
currently. Of course, this is the same system that puts folks in jail for 
pot, so I guess the fact that it doesn't work at all and makes no sense 
whatsoever should be expected.

I'd really like to see the folks that are so gung-ho to have people offed be 
the one to throw the switch though. We'd see how much they REALLY believed 
in what they said if that were the case.

Burbs? Sorry, I grew up in south dakota (dirt poor, trailerhouse
trash), then rural alaska (550 miles from the nearest taco bell and
stoplight), and then finally moved to the bay area when I was 18.

I understand the environment he came from, and regardless of what you
think, his actions  were still wrong. He got the sentence for the
crime he commited, and it was carried out.

When you kill someone, you're prematurely ending their lives. When you
rape someone, you're crushing their souls. When you turn someone into
a junkie, you're frying their brain.
Doesn't that also sound as though you're playing god?

Oh but wait dude - he's our president! We have to swear blind allegience to 
him...not unlike...HITLER! YAY BUSH!!! You're my hero!!!

(even though a couple of days ago he said if he had to do it over again, 
even given the "bad intelligence", he'd do it EXACTLY the same way)

That's what's so great about this nation. How fucking absurdly hypocritical 
people are here.

You know - kill a dirty black gang banger, that's ok. Make MENTION of 
someone offing Bush for getting hundreds of thousands of people killed under 
false pretenses, and it's "unpatriotic".

it was never prove that he committed the crime. everything the court went on was assumed circumstantial evidence. i am not saying he did or didn't commit the crime but from what i have read i didn't see any proof that he did. 

even if he did, he is helping people to not get involved in ganged activity. why not leave him in jail with a life sentence without parole?

the Conservative religious right scares me. it is o.k. to kill an adult but not to o.k. to abort a fetus. makes absolutely no sense.

I'd really like to see the folks that are so gung-ho to have people offed be 
the one to throw the switch though. We'd see how much they REALLY believed 
in what they said if that were the case.

Burbs? Sorry, I grew up in south dakota (dirt poor, trailerhouse
trash), then rural alaska (550 miles from the nearest taco bell and
stoplight), and then finally moved to the bay area when I was 18.

I understand the environment he came from, and regardless of what you
think, his actions  were still wrong. He got the sentence for the
crime he commited, and it was carried out.

When you kill someone, you're prematurely ending their lives. When you
rape someone, you're crushing their souls. When you turn someone into
a junkie, you're frying their brain.
Doesn't that also sound as though you're playing god?

Daniel Bell is one of the most important and respected names in the history
of dance music.  His stripped-down funky style, epitomized in his
underground hit "Losing Control", influenced a generation of producers and
helped launch a new "minimal" aesthetic in dance music. Having lived in
Berlin since 2000 and spent the last 2 years touring around the world, we
are honored to present this true pioneer in his first SF appearance in over
5 years.

Daniel Bell's Biography:  (courtesy of Telegraph Records)

Born in Sacramento, California, Daniel Bell grew up outside of Toronto ,
Canada, and then moved to Detroit where he collaborated with Richie Hawtin
as Cybersonik for three years on +8 Records. In 1991, he started his own
label, Accelerate, on which he released his influential releases as DBX.
Based on nearby Chicago "track" records, he reduced that sound further into
funky, streamlined grooves. The formula proved to be successful and helped
launch a new aesthetic in techno and house music known as "minimal".

With the overwhelming success of his "Losing Control" single in 1994, Danie=
l
set up 7th City Distribution in order to assist smaller Midwest labels to
get distribution in overseas markets. He also created three new labels - 7t=
h
City, Elevate and Harmonie Park . In 2000, he relocated to Berlin, Germany =
,
and released his first mix CD, "The Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell", on
Tresor Records, followed in 2003 by "The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!"
He since has produced a series of remixes for a diverse range of artists,
includng John Tejada, Pantytec, Akufen and Martin Landsky. He has spent the
last 2 years traveling and DJing around the world, and is currently touring
the U.S. and preparing to hunker down in the studio in the coming year.

Subject: [sfraves] record and mixer cases

i've been putting this off for years but i think in '06 i'll finally  
be ready to get cases for my turntables and mixer, and wanted to get  
opinions from the listers.  i have 2 1200's (about 10 years old now)  
and a Pioneer DJM-600 mixer.  a quick google search came up with the  
brand name ace that sells cases for both products.  what does anyone  
think about these and what are good retailers these days ('05 style)  
for these kinds of products.

thanks again for any input!

Death Penalty Reliability 

<http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=412&scid=6>As of March 2005, 119 innocent people have been released from death rows across the country since 1973 (Northwestern University, DP Information Center). Researchers Radelet and Bedau found 23 cases where innocent people were executed since 1900 (In Spite of Innocence, Northeastern University Press, 1992). <http://www.mvfr.org/DeathPenaltyFacts.htm>Murder Victims' Families for Reconciliation, Inc.

Carried Out Disportionately 

<http://www.thurgoodmarshall.com/speeches/masks_article.htm>Thurgood Marshall said it was racist, unfair to poor and the mentally retarded, and often ends in the state sanctioned murder of innocents. 
    * Less than 1% of all murderers are condemned to death 
    * 2% of death row inmates are actually executed 
    * Over 113 people on death row have been exonerated since 1973 
    * 68% of the death penalty convictions between 1973 - 1995 were reversed 
    * Today more than 75 death row inmates have spent 20 years on the Row. 
    * Capital punishment is applied to a higher percentage of minorities than whites. 

[PDF] <http://www.karisable.com/url?sa=U&start=10&q=http://lsr.nellco.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1062%26context%3Dupenn/wps&e=10053>The Role of Deterrence in the Formulation of Criminal Law

It is not cost effective:

Capital murder trials threaten to bankrupt townships costing taxpayers: 
    * $2 million in legal fees to try a death penalty case, nearly 4 times higher than comparable murder trials. 
    * The automatic appeal process costs up to $700,000 in legal fees. 
    * $1.2 million in execution costs. 
    * 1973 -1998, Florida spent $57 million on 18 executions. 

It is does not deter crime: 

The two states with the most executions in 2003, Texas 24, and Oklahoma 14, saw increases in their murder rates from 2002 to 2003.  Both states had murder rates above the national average in 2003:  Texas - 6.4, and Oklahoma - 5.9.  The top 13 states in terms of murder rates were all death penalty states. The murder rate of the death penalty states increased from 2002, while the rate in non-death penalty states decreased.<http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/>Death Penalty Information Center

The Death Penalty has been abolished in all other Western Countries and civilized societies, except the US:

The European Union (EU) is <http://europa.eu.int/comm/external_relations/human_rights/adp/index.htm>opposed to the death penalty in all cases and is "deeply concerned about the increasing number of executions in the United States of America (USA), all the more since the great majority of executions since reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 have been carried out in the 1990s. Furthermore, in the US, young offenders who are under 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the crime may be sentenced to death and executed, in clear infringement of internationally recognized human rights norms."  Even <http://press.coe.int/cp/97/640a%2897%29.htm>Russia and Turkey have abolished the death penalty which is condemned by the European Union and the World Court, which claimed that the <http://www.thenewamerican.com/artman/publish/article_1018.shtml>U.S. violated the rights of 51 Mexicans on death rows in eight states.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj jen lasher: no more tears

I'm sorry, I just think this is funny. like it might be embarrassing,
and certainly I can understand people being upset about it, and yes,
ex-boyfriends are sometimes vicious bastards, but you live life like a
rock star, and then you're angry because you have an audience? come
on, get over yourselves. any one of us could have been born a peasant
in China or a slave in Kuwait. have some perspective. it isn't such a
big soap opera. a party girl partied. that isn't even news.

there was a DJ here in SF. the Bush Administration initiated
deportation proceedings against him because he was Pakistani. he's
gay. in Pakistan, homosexuality is a crime punishable by death. THAT
is sad. he came here to escape being killed by a bunch of psychotic
religious zealots for loving who he loved and being who he was, and
none of us can help loving who we love or being who we are, and a new
bunch of psychotic religious zealots sent him right back to his death
for being born where he was born, and having skin the color that it
was, as if he could have done anything about being born where he was
born and having skin the color that it was, as if that meant anything,
as if he was some kind of ping-pong ball, doomed to death at the hands
of religious zealots, and the only question was which gang of assholes
got him.

I could cry for that man. I've never met him, never heard him spin. I
could cry for him anyway. and Jen Lasher's sex video uploaded to the
Internet is supposed to be sad? no. it isn't sad. it's just silly. and
funny. anybody who lives a life where the worst thing that happens to
you is that people find out that you have sex? that is a good life.
that is an exceptionally good life.

you guys are making such a big deal out of this video, like it's such
a horrible thing. be realistic. be honest. the only really horrible
thing about that video is the cinematography. if we're going to treat
this video as a public disaster, then the real tragedy isn't that a
bunch of people saw Jen Lasher naked. the real tragedy is that Dara
doesn't own a tripod. those things are like twenty bucks.

is this KJ you're talking about?  he spins psytrance.

if so, he hasn't been deported yet.  he had a preliminary trial
last week, and they're going to revisit it next year, i think. 
supposedly, the US is leaning toward letting him stay.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Use it.

It's long-standing tradition on this list to include "NRR" in the
subject of messages that are Not Rave-Related. Doing so not only makes
it easy for subscribers to skip over messages that they're not
interested in, but also makes it easier to trash such messages
automatically.

Discussions concerning politics, people's sex lives, new business ideas,
or anything else that isn't even remotely relevant to raving should be
tagged accordingly, as a courtesy to the list's readers.

Thanks,

Too bad it's a waste posting this, cuz those whom he's trying to educate are 
too ignorant to understand the reality.

But thanks nonetheless Apollo - it's nice to see that people can still have 
facts to back up their arguments.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] dj jen lasher: no more tears

The real tragedy is that your life is so devoid of content or meaning that 
you have to make light of something shitty that happened to someone you 
don't even know. Oh - she's a "celebrity" so it's ok, right? Well fuck you. 
She's a friend of mine, and I look out for my friends.

One of the shittiest things about this country these days is the fact that 
so many people are so concerned with other people's lives ASIDE from their 
own, that they feel the need to dig into their personal bullshit to find 
entertainment. That just speaks volumes about how PATHETIC they are as 
humans.

Grow up.

I'm sorry, I just think this is funny. like it might be embarrassing,
and certainly I can understand people being upset about it, and yes,
ex-boyfriends are sometimes vicious bastards, but you live life like a
rock star, and then you're angry because you have an audience? come
on, get over yourselves. any one of us could have been born a peasant
in China or a slave in Kuwait. have some perspective. it isn't such a
big soap opera. a party girl partied. that isn't even news.

there was a DJ here in SF. the Bush Administration initiated
deportation proceedings against him because he was Pakistani. he's
gay. in Pakistan, homosexuality is a crime punishable by death. THAT
is sad. he came here to escape being killed by a bunch of psychotic
religious zealots for loving who he loved and being who he was, and
none of us can help loving who we love or being who we are, and a new
bunch of psychotic religious zealots sent him right back to his death
for being born where he was born, and having skin the color that it
was, as if he could have done anything about being born where he was
born and having skin the color that it was, as if that meant anything,
as if he was some kind of ping-pong ball, doomed to death at the hands
of religious zealots, and the only question was which gang of assholes
got him.

I could cry for that man. I've never met him, never heard him spin. I
could cry for him anyway. and Jen Lasher's sex video uploaded to the
Internet is supposed to be sad? no. it isn't sad. it's just silly. and
funny. anybody who lives a life where the worst thing that happens to
you is that people find out that you have sex? that is a good life.
that is an exceptionally good life.

you guys are making such a big deal out of this video, like it's such
a horrible thing. be realistic. be honest. the only really horrible
thing about that video is the cinematography. if we're going to treat
this video as a public disaster, then the real tragedy isn't that a
bunch of people saw Jen Lasher naked. the real tragedy is that Dara
doesn't own a tripod. those things are like twenty bucks.

speaking of which, whatever happened to Geri Dahl?  did she finally get sick

missed whatever happened. did she go out with a whimper or a roar?

a friend of mines, now in Colorado, actually hung out with Geri for a
spell, says she's a nice person.

the last entries I have in my separate Geri Dahl gmail filter/folder
that I set up for her, because she's *that* special, is from this past
February on the 13th & 15th.

(12-14) 08:38 PST WASHINGTON, (AP) --

President Bush accepted responsibility on Wednesday for the decision
to go to war with Iraq despite faulty intelligence but said the
decision to oust Saddam Hussein was still correct.

"It is true that much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong. As
president I am responsible for the decision to go into Iraq," the
president told The Woodrow Wilson Center on the eve of elections to
establish Iraq's first permanent, democratically elected government.
"And I'm also responsible for fixing what went wrong by reforming our
intelligence capabilities. And we're doing just that."

The president said Thursday's parliamentary elections in Iraq are a
watershed moment that will inspire democracy across the Middle East.
But with public opinion still running against his mission, Bush still
was left defending his decision to go to war nearly three years ago.

"We are in Iraq today because our goal has always been more than the
removal of brutal dictator," Bush said. "It is to leave a free and
democratic Iraq in his place.

"My decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision. Saddam
was a threat and the American people and the world is better off
because he is no longer in power," the president said.

The speech was the last in a series of four presidential addresses
leading up to Thursday's vote.

As he usually does, Bush asserted that the Iraq of the future, with a
functioning democracy and thriving economy, would be a model for other
nations in the turbulent Middle East. But he added a specific
reference to the inspiration that a free Iraq could provide to
reformers in the region's two governments most hostile to the United
States  Syria and Iran.

this is just like the diebold ceo resigning and the talk of finally printing paper receipts from the voting machines (although diebold makes bofa atm that have been spitting out paper receipts for years) this is a bit too late as well. bush was handed elections that he lost twice. this country in a shit hole because of this. i guess if you are rich and only care about your trust fund or bank account bush winning is good but for the other 99% of america this has been a disaster.

sorry to sound so drab, the last 5 years has been hell for me politically. everythig that has happened to this country has been really hard to stomach.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Use it.

It's long-standing tradition on this list to include "NRR" in the
subject of messages that are Not Rave-Related. Doing so not only makes
it easy for subscribers to skip over messages that they're not
interested in, but also makes it easier to trash such messages
automatically.

Discussions concerning politics, people's sex lives, new business ideas,
or anything else that isn't even remotely relevant to raving should be
tagged accordingly, as a courtesy to the list's readers.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Bush accepts responsibility for war

Funny - did he ever try asking the Iraqi citizens if they WANTED a 
democratic nation? I love how our country assumes the entire world wants to 
be just like us.

Kind of like the Roman Empire assumed the entire world wanted to be under 
their rule.

no, it's americans who are so concerned with other people's lives _as 
a way_ ("aside" isn't quite right)
of ignoring their own that is the problem.   celebrities, iraqis, 
....   but that's extroverts for you...   I'm slowly coming to the 
conclusion that excessive extroversion is a big factor in all of the 
world's problems

frankly, she's not that attractive anyhow IMO, so.... <shrug>   But 
Giles has nothing better to do than
post all day on SFRaves, so you can hardly expect better of him  :)

"My decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision. Saddam

Does it bother anyone else that our president has such difficulty with

The whole obsession with "democracy" largely generates from the ideolgies o=
f
Paul Wolfowitz.  Albeit, a type of democracy from the top down, in which
corporate interests rain supreme.  Any populous democratic movement to
represent the true interests of the majority is a major threat to the money
hungry bush camp- look what's been going on recently in venezuela, and what
happened to Aristide in Haiti.  The biggest fear is, an anti-american
government may be on it's way in Iraq.

 This sounds serious.  You should try to find an attorney yourself, but
in the mean time have you considered contacting Declan McCullagh?  He
writes a web column and e-mail list called politech and he's known to be

I urgently need to hand over some case files/information to someone safe

well, with the list volume these days compared to the 1990's and  
other lists, like dcraves, which i'm also subscribed to, which easily  
gets 350+ messages per day (i am unsure of what they talk about) ...  
one really could just start choosing by name and thread.  actually  
since i started using apple mail and can group by thread i pretty  
much delete the threads i am not interested in.

LOL!!!! OMFG!!!! gRoOvY!!!!

Dude could you please turn your email receipt request off it's annoying.

I do find an email confidentiality statement sent to a public email list
highly entertaining though so maybe the two balance each other out.

But then asking for private responses only and then responding back to
them publically is another point lost.  Very confused over here.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] anyone else see tosca at mezzanine?


I duuno, maybe I am not as picky as you guys.. but I thought the show was 
pretty sweet.  Maybe bot what was promised, but on listening to the 
recording I made a few times, I wished I had had another disk.. cuz it just 
kept getting better and better.  That is of course relative since the first 
25 minutes was preety off cuff.. strange little piano set for sure.. but I 
liked the music.. but the crowd wouldn't shut up.. as the neighbors were 
saying "I think people were getting a little frustrated".. with the music.  
So my first time seeing them live.. I don't own any Tosca.. but I hear the 
first five cds rock.  Off to the store!

Happy holidays!

ps.  I heard about the show an hour before.. headed down and found a 
ticket.. you can do it too :)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Lick The DJ on An Epiphany Of Sound right now

Just a reminder.  Lick The DJ is with us this week on An Epiphany Of 
Sound.  We've already kicked off the weirdness early morning style, so 
why don't you join us by listening in.  90.1 FM in the bay area and 
online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu from now until noon pacific time.

To remind you about Lick The DJ:
Lick The DJ has been hanging with the likes of FnF, so you know he knows his 
acid lines.  He's also part of Lost Tribe (the Sweet parties) and he's part of 
Lick The Micron (a tagteam duo with Micron.)  Peep him at 
http://www.lickthedj.com to find out more.

You can expect to hear things in the tech-house, house and techno 
realms, mainly with that good acid line!!  If you have questions or 
comments, call us up at 650-723-9010, or chat with us on AIM at kzsudj.

Peace!

inducing alpha patterns which create puddles of drool
dynamic peaks and valleys that frustrate sound engineers

we're on first at 9pm!!!
other bands playing (mostly powerpop/punk bidnis, should be very fun!):
One Size Fits All + Marisma + All Ages

      Victory

December 12, 2005
     What on earth does George W. Bush mean by /victory/? To remake Iraq 
in the image of Indiana?

    I suppose I am the 1,289,654th observer to note that the president 
does a poor job of articulating the goal of our military venture over 
there -- which is to defend our access to the oil of the Middle East.

     Incessantly flogging the word /freedom/ the past three years was 
probably his biggest mistake. It would have been more precise, modest, 
and useful to say that we were supporting elections under a new 
constitution (written with our assistance) because the alternative would 
be to just appoint a bunch of guys we liked to be a government -- and 
that government would have had no /legitimacy/ among the Iraqi people, 
not to mention the bawling of world opinion against it (and us). So, of 
course, elections were a necessity, and the policing required to make 
that happen has been an ugly struggle.

     Otherwise, the most conspicuous freedom in Iraq, for most Iraqis, 
the past three years has been freedom from reliable electrical service.

     But/ victory/? That's really a howler. Over what? The terrorists, I 
suppose, if you call the larger enterprise a War on Terror, another 
unfortunate locution. The fact is that there is a vast popular antipathy 
against the United States that emanates from west of Gibraltar clear 
across the eastern hemisphere to the south Pacific. In formal terms, it 
is an Islamic jihad. Its clear goal is to expel interlopers from Islamic 
territory. It imposes rather severe penalties on the perceived 
interlopers, and its tactics are not gentlemanly, especially where 
civilians are in the way.

     /Victory/ against this would seem to imply the extermination of at 
least tens of millions of Islamic young men, not a realistic goal. We 
are equally unlikely to charm them into a change of affection by 
demonstrating the art of elections.

      Getting back to the smaller theater of Iraq itself, we see a cast 
of characters arrayed against our presence: Shiites acting as proxies 
for neighboring Iran; former Baathists seeking crazily to regain 
control; Sunnis desperately trying to keep a hand in the oil revenue, 
since most of the oil lies in either Shiite or Kurdish territory; and of 
course there is probably a contingent of international jihadistas, young 
men from all over the Middle East and elsewhere, with no regular work 
except to harass and exasperate the infidel occupiers. There is 
certainly an inexhaustible supply of these young men. And an 
inexhaustible supply of munitions at their disposal. There is no chance 
whatsoever that we are going to pacify these warriors. They will not 
rest until we depart their /ummah/ and we are not going to do that until 
there is no oil left in it.

      So, /victory/ in any conventional sense that Americans understand 
this word is out of the question, and the President's use of it is his 
biggest blunder since the "mission accomplished" stunt of 2003. The Iraq 
elections may succeed in establishing a legitimate government -- but 
then what? Will it govern for a month and a half and fall apart? The 
eventual likely outcome, as everybody knows, is civil war in Iraq, and 
perhaps a widening conflict with Iran on one side, Syria on the other 
side, and Saudi Arabia left to the Jihadistas. Elsewhere in the world, 
things will continue to blow up.

     Meanwhile, back here in This Land is Your Land, the easy motoring 
utopia will remain non-negotiable and we'll drive Amtrak into bankruptcy.

Ok,=20

and people who wouldn't know what soap was even if were crammed up their =
ass sideways. I've gotten used to the wanna be thugs, the =

Today I transfer from McArthur towards Bay Point as I do every weekday =
AM. Normally my ride is very quiet. Not that many people heading out =
there, always half asleep or involved in their iPod or whatever.=20

Not this morning. Nope. I get on the train and 1st notice the stench of =
god knows what. Ok - so that's tolerable - not pleasant, but it's a =
relatively short ride to Lafayette, so I deal. Then I notice that =
everyone in the car near the doors are staring at the wall, obviously =
avoiding looking at something, awith looks of horror on their faces.

Gee - "whats that all about?" I wonder. So I look over, and on one of =
the seats near the door, a guy that looks like he's covered in either =
shit or vomit, has his hands crammed down his pants, and looks to be =
itching furiously. OK - that sufficiently disgusts me, but with homeless =
looking folks, I think I've seen worse. So I flip through tracks on my =
cd, and stop paying attention. Til I notice this woman sitting directly =
across from dude, and in my line of sight visibly GASPS, and gets up and =
moves. So, like curious little humans, a few of us turn our heads, and =
are greeted with...

The nasty dude FULL ON beating off. As if no one else is even there - =
he's like, INto the moment.=20

Needless to say, not fuckin cool AT ALL. You know - on the late night =
trains, I could almost see it happening and me not being too shocked - =
but at fuckin' 8:45am - it was a bit much.

Anyway - thought I'd share and traumatize the rest of you this morning =

SHARE IN MY AGONY!

YEa, it really was very unpleasant. I have never run off a BART train so 
fast in the almost 3 years I've been out here. Even to catch a transfer 
train, lol.

To be honest, I am pretty sure he was on drugs of some kind. He looked =

Geeze, you guys are elitist snobs. What's wrong with something so
natural as masterbation? You are probably the same type of people that
enjoy watching bodies get torn apart in "Troy".

 If it wasn't for all the rich white men keeping him down, maybe he
could get a good shower and clean clothes.By your description, it
sounds like he is a young white guy. Just another example of how
affirmative action seriously fucked up an entire generation.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Nastiest BART ride ever...

Sorry for "feeding the troll" folks - but....

WHY ARE YOU SO FUCKING STUPID STEVE?????

So - you have NO PROBLEM with some dude whipping his dick out on a BART 
train where CHILDREN and ELDERLY folks and god knows who else are riding??? 
That's ok to you???

What if YOUR CHILD was on the train you fucking MORON. I bet then you might 
not be so thrilled.

It's not as if I care what he does to himself IN PRIVATE - but on a fucking 
BART train? Please. There's something seriously WRONG with you if you think 
that's acceptable behavior.

Now kindly F.O.A.D.

Geeze, you guys are elitist snobs. What's wrong with something so
natural as masterbation? You are probably the same type of people that
enjoy watching bodies get torn apart in "Troy".

 If it wasn't for all the rich white men keeping him down, maybe he
could get a good shower and clean clothes.By your description, it
sounds like he is a young white guy. Just another example of how
affirmative action seriously fucked up an entire generation.

    could get a good shower and clean clothes.By your description, it
    sounds like he is a young white guy. Just another example of how=20
    affirmative action seriously fucked up an entire generation.

I like the statement about affirmative action.  So because of affirmative
action this guy can't get a job and has resorted to masturbatory celebrity
status on BART.  So: Affirmative Action Causes Jobless Young White Men to
Mastuerbate on Baypoint Bart!!!

Ok, first off, I'm not a troll. I'm an active member in this
community, and have been for a long ass time, and like other people on
here like to post my opinions, but it just so happens that my opinions
don't coincide with the majority here.

Secondly, my whole post was done as a joke, making fun of the
"open-mindedness, liberalism" here. Hell no would I be accepting of
some dude exposing himself and masterbating in front of me.

Maybe I am stupid Marco, or maybe I just look at things differently
then you. I just want to give people something to think about from the
other side.

i have nothing against the "candy scene" but the term "candy" usually 
isnt used to describe our parties....and why im at it, ill also be 
argumentative and say 50% of our crowd tends to be 21+....altho im sure 
thats pretty young compared to many of the folks on this list ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PNY?

I'll back up Chris on this - I've been to quite a few Modified parties, and 
while they do have some younger kids there, I don't think I've seen more 
than a couple candy kids at a time at any of their parties. And to be 
honest, I don't recall having seen ANY for a while now.

Good times at the Modified parties!

I can't understand why someone that seems so nice in person is such a
close minded jerk on-line. Is it normal for liberal people to fire
personal insults to people with opposing views? See my previous post,
I'm not a troll by definition since I am an active member in this
community.

I'm inclined to agree with Chris. Just because Modified events are all ages
does not mean they attract a large amount of under agers, in fact quite the
opposite. A friend and I had a conversation at the last show how there was
not a single person wearing candy.

Lots of good stuff to do on new years. If you are into the "candy" thing yo=
u
should check out the  party I'm playing at, All Together.

Just FYI Steve - put the shoe on the other foot and the same can be said of 
you.

When I met you, you seemed like a decent guy - then your "online persona" 
made it's appearance, and pretty much any decent opinion I had of you flew 
right out the window.

I can't understand why someone that seems so nice in person is such a
close minded jerk on-line. Is it normal for liberal people to fire
personal insults to people with opposing views? See my previous post,
I'm not a troll by definition since I am an active member in this
community.

Well that's BS.
 
 From Wikipedia, 
 
 "In Internet terminology, a troll is a person who posts inflammatory messages on the internet, such as on online discussion forums, to disrupt discussion or to upset its participants. 'Troll' can also mean the inflammatory message itself posted by a troll or be a verb meaning to post such messages. 'Trolling' (the gerund) is also commonly used to describe the activity."
 
 This definition tells us that it is the intent of the posting (to disrupt or inflame) that makes a person or posting a troll, rather than their membership or lack thereof in the community of interest.  To be careful, it should be acknowledged that it is the *percieved* intent of the poster that makes others see them and their postings as trolls.
 
 Steve, you may feel that you are merely a member of this community with unpopular or misunderstood views, but other members are perceiving  that your intention in posting is merely to inflame or disrupt this list.  You might want to consider why that would be the case and how you might go about changing that perception.  
 
 Or not.  Whatever.
 
 Regards,
 
 Peter

The actions and priorities of people whom one would probably not call 
"liberal" have amplified the creation of a large underclass of 
untouchables in a nation that used to be a land of hope.

Most people look straight through the homeless, and certainly don't 
talk to them.  They aren't there, so to speak.  So this guy on a train 
where everybody wishes he were not there feels like an invisible 
outsider.  Further, he has no private space anywhere.  In a sense, he 
was alone and masturbating in private.

For a long time I gave a little money to homeless people, but always 
folded it lengthwise, so I could give it to them without touching them. 
  I would give them something and walk away quickly.  Eventually I 
learned from their eyes that what they wanted much more than a dollar 
was a hand to shake and somebody to look them in the eye and talk for a 
moment or two, as if there were two human beings present.  Now I carry 
a little bottle of alcohol in my pocket to clean my hands, and touching 
homeless people is less of a problem.  There hasn't been any need to 
give up my precious middle-class cleanliness.

The pseudo-Christians who have hijacked the government are leaving the 
homeless to rot in the streets.  What would Jesus do if he had been 
sitting with you on that BART car?  He would likely have gone over and 
sat down next to the guy jacking off, who would have pulled up his 
trousers a little sheepishly and started talking with the unexpected 
person acknowledging his humanity.  The hideous moment would have 
passed and been replaced by a pleasant astonishment that it was so easy 
to take things somewhere else.  Anybody on the car could have done that.

I'm not a Christian, and quite frankly am not too concerned with what Jesus 
would do. Just like a child who wants attention and will do anything, even 
bad things to get attention, you can't just coddle them "because". If he 
wanted attention that bad he could've struck up a conversation with someone 
just like half the homeless folks who ride BART, whom I will actually talk 
to like any other human being. But pulling out his cock and jacking off is 
just foul. Sorry.

Call me heartless, but I don't buy into that being something we should all 
be forced to embrace with open arms to make us "caring" people.

While I  agree with you wholeheartedly about human contact and the homeless, its important to remember that you not only need to have the desire and motivation to help someone, but also knowledge of the skilful means which can help them.  I'd say its not obvious how to help someone that is mastrubating in public on a train, and that while perhaps Jesus or Buddha or Ghandi or someone wiser than me might have been able to skilfully resolve this situation, the rest of us mere mortals would have simply got a lapful of jizz.

This thread, especially, has shown me how "Marc((O))" has a real  
talent for observation and writing; I hope you pursue it. the rest of  
you are just typical twenty-something hound dogs as far as your  
comments are here, just like most of my friends were. It's all good--

And been told "mrrrrmm, um, kinda busy... gimme a few seconds here, I'm

The social pressure of being surrounded by strangers + risk of arrest, etc 
should be greater than the will to spank that monkey.  But it was 
happening.  The guy was either crazy or high (aka temporarily crazy).  
Assuming a given stimulus would be met with rational response is well, 
irrational.

As for WWJD?  Well if said person (let's call him Handy) was in the temple 
with the moneychangers, Jesus woulda kicked Handy out with them.  If Handy 
was hanging out with the woman at the well, he'd tell her "Lady, you got 5 
husbands and you need to stop seeing that married man... and WHAT THE 
HEYNOW?!?! quit jerking off you sick monkey, it's bad enough my father can 
see people doing that anywhere they go, but you're not even trying to be 
slick about it!!!  *shakes head* so where were we?".  If Handy was coming 
up to Jesus while he was mourning the passing of Lazarus and considering 
reincarnating him, I'm thinking he might lose his temper for a second and 
we'd see some lightning/brimstone/pillar of salt action.

C'mon Will.  I know and understand the "turn the other cheek" & beatitudes 
benevolent loving god, but let's not forget the genocidal wrathful side 
(earth's entire population - one boatload drowned, whole cities and 
nations, eldest son, etc).

andyw

p.s.	sorry to anybody I might be offending, but I wasn't the one who 
put Jesus and Handy on the same BART car.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Troll alert! Re: [sfraves] NRR: Nastiest BART ride ever...

I think I should be flattered, lol.

Or I hope at least.

Observing folks is kind of something I've always done, and I tend to be able 
to read folks fairly accurately MOST of the time - not all - I'm by far not 
a sage individual. And I think that's what gives me an ability I have to 
write. Will I pursue anything further with writing? Most likely not, as I'm 
not that dedicated beyond the occasional blog and yapping on lists like 
this...but for me, that's all I need.

Either way, sarcasm or not - thanks for the words Will.

Yeah dude I'd like to see you walk up to the crazy homeless guy on BART
covered in vomit and feces with a hat over his eyes and his pants down
jacking off furiously in the middle of a bunch of people and sit down next
to him to gently help him pull his pants up.  Odds of gettin assualted = 
50% plus.  That one definitely qualifies as not my fuckin' problem if I'm
there.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Troll alert! Re: [sfraves] NRR: Nastiest BART ride ever...

Marco, before you get sand in your vagina again, I have a few words to
say to you. I think you take yourself WAY too seriously. You're
forgetting that you're living in the bay area, one of the most
culturally diverse cities in the united states, let alone the world.
You preach about equality and diversity, but yet I've yet to see you
NOT jump down someone's throat because someone has a different opinion
than you do. You and I might never agree on politics. In fact, I can
guarantee that we won't. However, you seem to be the first one to
ALWAYS jump down someone's throat when someone has something different
to say than how you think. That's not showing much for diversity.
Calling me a suburb kid without even knowing my family history, or
where I came from? not cool. And even if that be the case, everyone's
entitled to their opinions, and has the right to open their obnoxious
noise holes just as much as you open yours. Again, I have nothing
against you. I really don't know you and I think I've only met you
maybe a couple of times. However, the elitist tone you take with
others, and the drama-mine way you go about it, intentionally stirring
the pot with people when they state their opinion really bothers me.
It's just hurtful and mean, and I think you should really think about
what you say before you say it.

Ya'll are in the slacker capital of the world. Why the hell do ya'll
need to get so goddamn aggro?

I got back on this list to keep in touch with friends. not watch
thread after thread about "FUCK BUSH!" "FUCK BLAH BLAH BLAH" "YOU DO
DRUGS OH MY GOD!!", etc. It's hypocritical.

I want to know about raves, listen to mixes and songs that people
make, and crack jokes with friends. you're all taking this shit WAY
too seriously. For fuck's sake, it's email. stop it.

Oh, and btw:

Raves were dead long before I started going to them. Good thing the
music's gotten better.

Marco, before you get sand in your vagina again, I have a few words to
say to you. I think you take yourself WAY too seriously. You're
forgetting that you're living in the bay area, one of the most
culturally diverse cities in the united states, let alone the world.
You preach about equality and diversity, but yet I've yet to see you
NOT jump down someone's throat because someone has a different opinion
than you do. You and I might never agree on politics. In fact, I can
guarantee that we won't. However, you seem to be the first one to
ALWAYS jump down someone's throat when someone has something different
to say than how you think. That's not showing much for diversity.
Calling me a suburb kid without even knowing my family history, or
where I came from? not cool. And even if that be the case, everyone's
entitled to their opinions, and has the right to open their obnoxious
noise holes just as much as you open yours. Again, I have nothing
against you. I really don't know you and I think I've only met you
maybe a couple of times. However, the elitist tone you take with
others, and the drama-mine way you go about it, intentionally stirring
the pot with people when they state their opinion really bothers me.
It's just hurtful and mean, and I think you should really think about
what you say before you say it.

Ya'll are in the slacker capital of the world. Why the hell do ya'll
need to get so goddamn aggro?

I got back on this list to keep in touch with friends. not watch
thread after thread about "FUCK BUSH!" "FUCK BLAH BLAH BLAH" "YOU DO
DRUGS OH MY GOD!!", etc. It's hypocritical.

I want to know about raves, listen to mixes and songs that people
make, and crack jokes with friends. you're all taking this shit WAY
too seriously. For fuck's sake, it's email. stop it.

Oh, and btw:

Raves were dead long before I started going to them. Good thing the
music's gotten better.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Troll alert! Re: [sfraves] NRR: Nastiest BART ride ever...

Well, I had some time to ponder Mr. Dee's remarks on my (masturbatory free) 
BART ride home...and this is what I've come up with.

Bear in mind that I've already responded (civilly I should hope) to John 
off-list, so this is sort of an "in general" response. (please correct me if 
I'm wrong about being civil in my response John)

1st off, on the subject of me taking myself seriously. I kind of find that 
funny, as I tend to see myself more as the "class clown" or "smart ass" more 
than I take myself seriously. Nine times out of ten, I am in fact (as he 
pointed out) "stirring the pot" just to see what people say. I have to 
actually take my hat off to John for having the cajones to actually stick it 
to me and not come off sounding like a twat. Do I agree with his 
observations? Not really. Do I respect him for having his opinion? Fully. Is 
he right? That's a matter of personal taste. I'm sure folks like Steve and 
Giles, whom I gave loads of shit this week were doing cartwheels after 
reading that - and good for them! As much as I don't agree with any of what 
they spouted off, they deserve to have a laugh at my expense too.

One of the things I keep noticing being insinuated about me though is, that 
I'm a liberal. I'm actually not. I think most liberal opinions or ideas are 
just as silly as most conservative ideas. I'm way more "middle of the road", 
at least in my own feeling. As far as my stance on equality and diversity - 
you're damn right I believe in both. Does that mean I'm a hypocrite for 
shit-talking people of opposing opinions? Well - when their opinions are 
neither pro-equlaity or pro-diversity, I would say not. Just because I 
believe in those ideals, doesn't mean I then support people who DON'T. That 
would make me pretty fucking wishy-washy, now wouldn't it? But again - it's 
only my crappy opinion. I'm not telling anyone to buy into the horseshit 
that I spew, lol.

Now - John wants to hear about "raves" and "music" and whatnot. That's 
fine...but then he might have taken the time to point out that I happen to 
comment on those subjects quite frequently. I'm one of the VERY few DJ's I 
know that actually takes the time to be courteous enough to thank the people 
that book me, and review their parties. When someone asks for sources for 
buying music, who's one of the 1st folks to spout off LISTS of places to 
find music? When discussions of gear happen, I try and throw my limited 
knowledge in. John - if you want more music talk - by all means, start a 
thread and let's do it to it!

Are you seeing a  basic pattern emerge here though? Well, I'll spell it out 
- I comment on EVERYTHING!!! Life interests me! Politics, music, raves, 
cooking, living, breathing...you name it, I comment on it all, because I 
live life as fully as I can. I'm interacting with people - for good or for 
bad. But I'm not going to apologize for that, and I'm not ashamed of it.

On that note - I'll leave you all be for the evening, hehehe - have fun 
doing whatever you all are doing tonight and this weekend. Tonight I'm 
taking it easy, and getting ready for a good long 6 hour tattoo session 
tomorrow at Temple Tattoo in Oakland. Rest assured next week my political 
commentary will be at least minimized in favor of gushing about my new ink 
and the upcoming New Year's festivities!!!

ez folks,
Marco

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."
-Don Juan

"A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves."
-Edward R. Murrow

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

i have to agree wit both of u.... the only time i have seen any "Candy  
Kids"is when i go every once in a while to the events where they spin happy  
hardcore.  i use to be all into the "candy" but i sort of faded out of that  
faze.... but i still go i guess u would call it "candyed" out for like special  
occasions or like on the day wen my first rave was.

Together as One in los angeles.
The lineup isn't quite as bomb as I'd like -- the main room is all trance,
which is great to listen to but phhhbt for dancing :(

anyway, the lady friend whinged and whinged that she wants to go to
something huge for new years, and if huge is the primary qualifier... well,
it doesn't get much phatter than that. on this coast, at least.

actually, i was just skimming the lineup. All the drum and bass is like.
Tech-step. And.. buh. Maybe I should just stay in the bay area. I haven't
bought my tickets yet....

...but who wants to spend NYE in a grimy warehouse? I mean, grimy warehouse=
s
are great and all but.... /AND/ the ravers in LA are so refreshingly naive
and tarded out, as compared to the drunk and disorderly jadeatorium up here=
.

there's got to be another option.

i think im channelling geri. or osteen.

with no point,

sean

i think something like that could be very fun!  and maybe there  
wouldn't be too much talking going on, which is just fine by me!

btw, karina, how many people are on the list now?  i, too, think it  
would be interesting to see a few people maybe we haven't seen post  
before, or maybe some old timer that we thought disappeared but  
actually has just been lurking!

Just come out of the closet, dude. Your friends can tell and they
accept you. I can tell and I accept you. The only difference between
your friends and myself is that you're nice to your friends, so you've
earned their affection and their patience. You haven't been nice to
me, which means you haven't earned my affection or my patience, but I
feel kind of generous, so you can have both anyway. Merry Christmas. I
wish you the best.

Closet cases hardly ever think precisely, because most of their mental
energy goes towards avoiding the obvious, so, for the record, I never
threatened your golden boy. I described a series of horrible
transgressions against him and then asked him to imagine how he would
feel if I committed those humiliating transgressions in *public* and
apologized to him in *private*. That was all I did. The "threats" came
from his imagination, and his inability to read an entire sentence and
hold the whole thing in RAM at one time. The sole purpose of the
exercise was to make him pay attention to how vile, corporate, and
irresponsible he was being. That's all. That's it. I'm no threat to
him. He has less to fear from me than he does from the common
doormouse.

"Why riddle his body with bullets when I can set his soul on fire with
a slanderous mambo?"

Those of you who *did* read the original e-mail precisely may remember
I intended to unsubscribe. You may wonder if I still hold that
intention. I assure you, I do. I just needed to be sure sfraves would
permit me to leave.

If you've been here a while, you might have noticed that I've left
before, and just been drawn back, as if sfraves were the Death Star
and it held me in some kind of tractor beam. Even when dwelling miles
away, I've been unable to make an unsub stick. This time around, it's
different.

There's a bit in "Animal House" where John Belushi is utterly appalled
by his comrades' acceptance of defeat. His eyes bug out of his head,
and he goes, "Over? Did he say over?! NOTHING IS OVER UNTIL *WE*
DECIDE IT IS!"

We have decided: it is over.

We are done.

We sincerely apologize for the mess, and particularly for all the
smoking craters in the landscape.


Giles








ps -- we give you permission to interpret that as the royal we, if you
wish. it isn't quite how we intend it, but whatever. you may wonder if
we have gone completely insane. to be fair, we have certainly wondered
the same thing.

















pps -- sorry, I do have to add, "NRR" belongs to the mid 90s. all
modern e-mail applications can perform much more sophisticated
automated filtering than that. your request, Mr. Allen, is somewhere
between five to ten years behind the times. Thanks.

I would love to measure the noise to signal ratio at a hermitage social :)

Terry would be able to better answer the number of people on this list.. 
Last I checked, which was in 450+ people....

It would be nice to know how many people "read" this list...

i'm lurking. and usually watching pretty closely, too. But these last 
few months i've just feeling the need to follow more than contribute. 
However, i'll speak up if the need ever arises. That said, I'll use my 
delurking status to say HEYYY YO to everyone :)

were only about like 80 people there @ most.. but it was Dope!!  2
rooms... an outside smoking area... it kinda remeinded me of Overworld the
way Overworld was set up.. if some of u remember that place :)

Music that played was ummm.. OK.. we got there.. there was some like kinda
deep housey stuff playin.. Ummmm.. breaks followed after that... Jungle
after that a la The Doctor... Ummm... the big room opened up... hard nrg
played, Trance... oh oh oh.. then there was this like Slide show goin' on

wearin my top hat & I was in the room ('cause I wore my top hat on Friday
night), then people started like yelling & shit.. LoL... It was funny,,
Hello 2Day :)

Overall, it was a Groovy night.. caught up w/ alota people I Love & MIssed
so much, danced my ass off like there was no tomorrow, and just had fun!!!
 Probably more fun than i shoulda had, but fuck man.. it was just a wicked
time & when im Rome :)  LOLOLOLOLOLMAO.... HELLO 2DAY! :O)

OK.. lastnight night was interesting... like the day b4, Mz Kitty & I were
planning our Sat night plans... so when Sat night rolls around.. well.. I
ditched out of a house warming in the City i planned on being @, but
'cause of the rain & walking 2 the bus stop, I didn't go :(

But night time came around, I had a ride 2 the bus stop.. hoped on BART,
got 2 Berk, Adrianna mentioned she was gonna nap until i got 2 Berk.. but
when i got 2 her place, no 1 answerd.. so i figured she needed her sleep &
went 2 the City by myself...

OK.. not this is a trip.. like there was a gas leak or something on the
bart train & it hella smelled in my train... this was all like announced
on the train intercome thingies when the BART train was stopped in the
middle of the tube underwater got like almost 20 minutes or something like
that!  Freeeeeaky shit!  Then there was ths fight between two dudes in the
next train over.. interesting!!!

So Logistics over @ El Ricon was fuckin' Dope!!!  I mean.. it was Wicked
bein' w/ the Jungle Fam.. YAY!!  Needless 2 say.. the energy of the whole
night was just fuckin' Sick as Hell!!!  Loved it!

When i got there... Mal & Sharp were on the decks tearing up spinng hella
hard jungle, some liquid, alota yummy dubby stuff I Love!!  Logistics went
on next!!  OOOOH MY GOSH!!!  He well.. from what i remember, started out
light i guess, w/ the Atmo Jungle, went hard & just pretty much stayed
hard the rest of his set & went Raga a bit!!  Loved Loved Loved it!! 
Gridlok went on next & spun this fuckin' Awesome set.. he did some live
shit off his computer, spun records, & played CDs... WOW... & it was
Sick!!!  Method one went on after him & played oh gosh.. it was a yummy
set!

After El Ricon.. went over 2 the the Timevala warehouse & watched vid,
after that, went 2 Al & Maz's pad after.. then instead of waiting 4 bart 2
open from their pad, I thought about getting food & hangin' out @ Shadow 4
the Sunday morning thing :)  So i cut outta there around 4:30ish then
ended up @ 1015.. LOL.. ok.. it was Trance on all floors.. LOL.. so
funny... yeah... kinda etarded out like in the club.. LoL... so i just 1st
kicked it w/ a few bar backs & security homies there.. then I saw my
homegirl Mina there, so we just kicked it & talk shit 4 like 2 hours:)

around 6:30, i went over 2 Shadow 4 the Sunday thing... LoL.. met soem
Groovy people there... hmmm... I dunno.. i wasn't really diggin' the house
there, so i just took out my notebook & wrote... but it was Dope!!  Saw
Vlad there & we talked 4 a bit !!  Love U Dude :)

I've been lurking on and off since 1992 when the list was hosted at
Stanford.edu

My partying days are long over but I still like to keep in touch with what
the kids are up to and the occasional funny links that are posted here.

Been lurking on and off for about 5 years. I'm doing well, taking care of my 
two little ones. I read SFR during lunchtime or breakfast while I eat. It's 
my 10 minute break.

Wow - I'm sorry the ten minutes you take to read SFR is probably spent 
deleting my onslaught of emails...hehehe.

My apologies!

How was everyone's weekend?? I got my left sleeve (tattoo) started! Almost 
all the outlining is done, I go back in a couple weeks to start the color!!!

I've been casually lurking (meaning I don't really
read all the e-mails)for a couple years.  And i've
been working and learning and stuff.  And things.

I lurk here, but I'm chatty on the raverg list. I just find I have more in common over all with the self-identified 'older' ravers. 
   
  I do enjoy the music and scene information here, and I learn a great deal. But I also find the labels and endless subgenres limiting in terms of what people are 'allowed' to enjoy. It seems that if you admit to liking a particular sound or person, it sparks some pretty passionate naysaying that I don't think really encourages honest opinion sharing. So while I appreciate the suggestions on the music, I'm not enticed to go out on a limb and share my feedback, particularly as I find I'm often on the opposing side of show reviews here.
   
  How am I? Pretty damn good and looking forward to a 'grate' 2006. 
  Happy pagan holidays, KFH

I hope to see you stay Adriana, I understand why you might want to leave, 
but know there are people here who love you just the same and who always 
appreciate your anecdotes and kind words...

Good to hear that you've been all right!!! Working mad hours is definitely 
rewarding but can be equally tiresome and draining.  It is good to hear 
from you (yes 1.5 weeks of lurking counts :)!!!! I hope you have a happy 
holiday and send you lots of love and smiles...

:)

Karina

Woah! For some reason I didn't realize that was you. I love your mix from 
10.24.93, I was bouncing up and down to it yesterday and was playing it 
over and over again. Do you have any more mixes ... from that era and do 
you still have the vinyl from those days? Much love!!!! Thanks for the 
awesome beats...

Love

Iy, chi hua hua..  I mean, the funny thing is that in a group like this, calling somebody, to paraphrase, "a faggot" is hardly worth doing.  Should I be insulted?  Should I laugh?  
 
 Shawn's a quality character that I make music with, and I'm sure I'd copulate wildly with him if we had different sexual preferences, but that's beside the point, really.  He is good people.  I have found some of the things you've said here to be offensive at worst and flamebait at best (and yes, I did RTFOP).  I know it's not terribly good netiquette to poke or prod flamers but I understand you're jesting, I'm jesting, none of this is real, so who cares, really?
 
 You seem to have taken on the mantle of demagogue, Shawn is a take-no-sh*tter online, and me, well, I like to laugh and point.  ..and find new ways to cook tofu.  We all have our roles.
 
 I've read my Anton Wilson, my Adams, my Malaclypse the Younger.  I know where your particular brand of tomfoolery springs from, and far-be-it-from-me to keep you from turning SFR into your own personal stream of conciousness.  Be my guest.  It's just that when you make scoffing threats at friends of mine, I get to scoff back, capice?  Share and share the waste of electrons alike.
 
 Lately this list has turned into a study of how to marginalize onesself, then flip the situation to make it appear that one is the victim.  Too funny.  I think I've hung out in Emi's back yard with you, Giles.  I think we might have talked about music or something.  You're more entertaining than insulting and you seem to be a smart cat.
 
 The internet is a tremendously effective way to garner attention for onesself, and I think you've found your forum!  All of this sturm-und-drang is just another layer of me-me-me-pick-me-*waves hand*-ism, and I suppose that's perfectly alright, and in keeping with your pattern.  
 
 Cock!  It's what's for dinner.
 
 Fnord,
 -GC

Just come out of the closet, dude. Your friends can tell and they
accept you. I can tell and I accept you. The only difference between
your friends and myself is that you're nice to your friends, so you've
earned their affection and their patience. You haven't been nice to
me, which means you haven't earned my affection or my patience, but I
feel kind of generous, so you can have both anyway. Merry Christmas. I
wish you the best.

Violet,

We share a number of things in common !

Where do you go to College? Untaken opportunities are some of the best - 
photography rocks (I'm never anywhere without my camera); must be that I 
come from a family of photographers... Horses rule! Do you have one 
yourself? I have two of them and have had 16 at one point in my life 
(gotta love equines), swimming is fun too... I also love to travel.

Hope you are having a serene day :)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Winter solstice marathon on KZSU NOW!

So I slacked in letting folks know about our special today.  24 hours of 
house in celebration of the Winter Solstice (Go bean king!!) on 90.1 FM, 
KZSU.  We're over half way done though!

Right now it's Jon Barnes on the decks, and he'll be followed by 
Stevian.  After that, I'm not sure!  (I didn't do the booking this time 
around.)  So help us celebrate by listening in!!  90.1 FM here by the 
bay and http://kzsulive.stanford.edu online.

Oh, and since it's xmas and the economy kind of sucks, BUY MORE CRAP! 
(or not.) ;)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] paging dj darwyn

lol.. i do. both the mixes and quite a few of the
recs.. even HIS recs, haha! i think i have the first 2
cassettes, funky theory and uh.. sugarcrappy beets? no
no, it was something else.. anyway, whatever that 2nd
one was.. also, believe it or not, i actually have a
few archive tapes of the endless practice sessions of
those early morning hours in my dinky box garage
apartment thing... in those days, chris would rock out
3 tracks, i would trainwreck 3 tracks, he'd rock 3
more and i'd screw up 3 more... it went on for hours,
and silly me, i recorded it all. lol. I learned all I
could from him before actual playing out experience
took over.. and then he turned all techno on me..
bleh.
Oh well, good times Obi-Wan!

Subject: [sfraves] SFR phantom search (whatever happened to ...?)

just off the top of my head ... i'm curious whatever happened to a  
few listers that just sort of disappeared and we never heard from  
them again.

maybe they're lurkers?  i doubt it.

mr. nstuff
dank smoker
ecko
ken stuart
larry ching (you still around larry?)

oh yea and what's up with geri dahl?  i was just starting to get used  
to those random ass posts of hers ...

anyway ... a couple of these people just like dropped off the face of  
the earth or something.  i feel like going around with a sign at all  
the airports and yelling their names.

anyone know anything?  cough it up!

oh man ... stop making me feel guilty.  actually 'read' the list ... =]

397 isn't bad but it's definitely down from the 600 or so we used to  
have.  i don't know how many are on dcraves, which i'm also subbed to  
but there's like sometimes upwards of 250 posts per day, that's  
probably double the amount this list used to achieve.  but there's no  
way i could read all those posts.

you know there was a time when i used to feel like i had to read (and  
perhaps reply to) every post?  wow!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] paging dj darwyn

Rather than just bash two of the greatest EDM talents to come out of the bay
area, why not make a suggestion??  I suppose that might actually take some
thought, eh??  Or are you one of these Super DJ whores?  Jockin PVD, Tiesto,
Oakie or some other random asshat.  Wait.  Who the hell are you to insinuate
that Freaky Chakra and SCO are washed up has beens??  Obviously someone who
doesn't have half a clue..

Psssssh.

CJ

I never knew Freaky Chakra was a "Washed up has been."  You don't have to
like the man or his music, but at least give him the respect he deserves fo=
r
helping put SF on the global party map.

    Where is this Freaky Chakra  single cell orchestra going down...
otherworld?  When was the last time Single Cell put out a record/CD?!

but DJ Mag sez they're the best DJs in the world!

i met a couple guys at Burning Man that were going to pants Paul 
Oakenfold while he was playing at the Opulent Temple, but the way the

like the man or his music, but at least give him the respect he deserves for
helping put SF on the global party map.

    Where is this Freaky Chakra  single cell orchestra going down...
otherworld?  When was the last time Single Cell put out a record/CD?!

I was going to throw skittles at Jokenfold, but for some reason
(I think some dude broke into our RV that night) I wasn't able
to.  :(

I also wanted to pull out my weenis and wave it at Tiesto, but
I decided to sleep that night.

Subject: [sfraves] Regarding Lurking . . . .



I've been continuously on this list for over a decade . . .
granted I don't post that often, but I try to get a word in, edgewise
from time to time.

I will forever be grateful to this list for helping us launch Frequency 8
in 1995 - hard to believe that we did a $3. party, every 2 weeks,
on the beach, from May to October of that year.
Everyone who helped out, everyone who came - came because
of this list.  Some of those people became lifelong friends.

I feel that I know a lot of the people who post with current
regularity probably far better than you guys know me.
That may be changing, soon.

My admiration/respect/gratitude for what Brian, Terry and Katrina have
done to keep this venue vital is lifelong.

Namaste and I hope everyone has the best holidays, possible!

Jim Cyr

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Attn EDM-based artists of all types

This goes out to all of you who are involved in this "scene" of ours in one
way or another...

I've recently added new section to the newsletter, a monthly spotlight
featuring various artists associated with dance culture. This includes DJs,
producers, designers, writers and even dancers who feel they offer a unique
perspective - basically I'm down to feature anyone who feels they have some
creative offering that revolves around the dance community.

What I provide.

4 week full-page spotlight in D'Fly News. (Bio, featured work, pics, etc)
I offer to host the material during the feature period (music, photos,
writings, etc). Unfortunately, streaming video is too large for me to host
through my own server, but if you are a visual artist and have video online
then I can push the link instead.

Most of all you get lots of free, wide-spread expsosure (well over 3000
heads now, globally).

Interested?

If so, then drop me a line at feature@djdragnfly.com and tell me what your
all about.  I've broken down what I'd need from those wanting to submit
material for consideration. 

DJs - 60 continuous mix. Mix should be clean (no trainwrecks please) in the
form of a CD or high quality mp3.

Producers - at least one original track that is audience-ready in the form
of a CD or mp3.

Designers (clothing, flyer design, event decoration) - got a portfolio
showcasing what you've done to create those unforgettable environments? Send
me a sample of pics or a link where I might find some of your work.

Dancers - Liquid, breaks, poi, glowsticking. anything goes... Have a source
of streaming video featuring your abilities? Again I can't provide hosting
for video, but if you have streaming video up already, then I can include a
link to that if you're featured.

Writers - people have inspired to write some great stuff as a result of a
great party. Have something you'd like to share? I'd like to hear it and
pass on your stories.

Well that's about it.

If you're looking for an example of what a feature looks like, then the last
page I had dedicated to GAMMA. http://www.djdragnfly.com/feature/GAMMA/ 

If you have any questions just shoot me an email or through myspace at:

Subject: [sfraves] Someone looking for Thomas Trouble?

Somebody mentioned that TT had gone overseas. While looking for Linux 
ISOs, I found this torrent, which appears to be the '50 besten Tracks' 
in Germany. Check out Track 8:

8__Thomas Trouble And Blutonium Boy - Alarma (Thomas Trouble Mix)

You know you want to seed it....

Er..  Yes, FC playing at OW is a semi-annual occurance sometimes..  The reason for that is he always rocks the party, brings a lot of vibe, and is a long-term favorite of much of the bay area's most clued-in dancers.
 
 Motherfucker is somehow able to do this garganuan live set running Ableton Live with a pretty decent number of tracks on an age-old iBook- that's magic, in my book (Macs don't run Live well).
 
 ..and SCO is a legend!  (for good reason)
 
 Who would you rather see?

yup!  we'll have at least 3 shuttles running all night
from a parking lot next to the 19'th street bart. 
this parking lot will also have security all night.  
so we ask everybody to take the shuttles and not drive
to the venue.  at the last event we had a lot of cars
broken into and we'd hate to see that happen again.  
also it helps the venue not to have a ton of people
and cars out front. 
   
anyways we're doing everything we can to make this
event as safe as possible, so please work with us and
take the shuttles even if you know how to get to
OtherWorld.
the shuttle parking lot is only 1 mile from
OtherWorld, so it's just a couple minutes drive and
there should be little wait if any. 

more info coming on that.  check the website for
updates... 
                                           thanks, Mike

Vanuatu, etc!) to be there with us.

THANK YOU ALL FOR AN AMAZING 2005!!!

Maybe that story got messed up... maybe it's a different story.

I was um... out of my frikking mind, and with an entourage, running around 
swearing I was gonna pee on Oakie (bm2000).

Pantsing someone at Burning Man is like putting on a wig at a clown 
convention.

-&e->Dancers - Liquid, breaks, poi, glowsticking. anything goes... Have a source

Partygoers consider rave class action suit

Alan Choate DAILY HERALD

Legal proceedings against Utah County officials over two law enforcement raids on large raves this summer could expand to include allegations that officials violated the rights of all the people who attended the parties.

"We're considering filing a separate lawsuit for the people in attendance," said Brian Barnard, a Salt Lake City attorney who is representing the plaintiffs <http://adserver.harktheherald.com/adclick.php?n=a1d19a67>
[]
 in the case.

The organizers of the raves, which took place July 16 and Aug. 20 in Spanish Fork Canyon, and the owners of the property where they occurred already have filed suit in federal court, alleging the Utah County sheriff's officers went too far when they shut down the rave and forced everyone off the property. 

"The current lawsuit is on behalf of the landowner and the promoters," Barnard said. "It essentially asks the sheriff to leave them alone."

As for the attendees -- about 350 at the first event, and 1,000 at the second -- "most of them are law-abiding citizens who paid money to see a concert and got scared out of their wits and chased away by SWAT officers," said Barnard.

"An ordinary citizen has the right to be left alone."

In court filings, Utah County has said that the events weren't properly permitted and that law enforcement officers witnessed "rampant" drug use, which prompted them to shut down the raves.

The filings also contend that the actions of law enforcement did not violate anyone's rights and were reasonable given 
the situation. 

Named in the pending lawsuit are Utah County, Sheriff James Tracy, Lt. Grant Ferre, county attorney Kay Bryson, and county commissioners Jerry Grover, Larry Ellertson and Steve White.

Attorney Peter Stirba, who is representing Utah County, could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

The plaintiffs have set up a Web site, www.utahconcertraids.com, for people to report their experiences at the events.

The new suit, if filed, would be a class action seeking monetary damages for the attendees. A class action allows a court to address the claims of a large group of people without the need for hundreds of individual lawsuits.

"The class action is for everyone who was there at the show," said Brandon Fullmer of Uprok Records, one of the promoters of the events. "Their rights were violated. ... Especially the ones who got harmed, and there were quite a few of them.

"You go to a show, you don't expect to be there for a half hour and then get shut down because of what 'they' wanted to do -- because 'they' don't think it's right."

Barnard said officers could have dealt with any illegal activity less intrusively.

"You punish the people who are doing something wrong," he said. "You don't throw out a dragnet and go after everybody who was there."

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

Subject: [sfraves] Are you symmetrical?

A study of Jamaican teenagers done at Rutgers finds that people who are more symmetrical are judged to be better dancers, "The new study involved 183 Jamaican teenagers, ranging between 14-19 years old, who danced while their movements were captured using motion-capture cameras similar to those used in video games and movies to give computer-generated characters fluid movements.  Women watching the recordings preferred the dances of men who were more symmetrical, while men were more impressed by the dances of more symmetric females."
 
 I'll also note this little tidbit, "While most people don't go around measuring and comparing body parts of potential mates, it's thought that we pick up on these cues subconsciously. The idea that there is an association between body symmetry and health comes from various animal and human studies. Peahens and barn swallows prefer males with more symmetrical tails. One study found that women experience more orgasms during sex with male partners whose features are more symmetrical, regardless of the level of romantic attachment or the sexual experience of the guy."

What you need is some Lagunitas Brown Shugga. That'll put a veil on your 
thoughts.

This is what happens when I kick it with some old non-electronic oriented 
highschool friends and bring recording gear....  We just drank and 
progressively got wasted while picking names out of a hat for who records 
the next track..  I must say I'm impressed in getting the 1st track that 
plays out of a trio of "normal" girls.  check the pictures.. heh heh...

Herbal is one of my favorite clubs ever..  Super tasteful yet unpretentously beautiful little downbeat lounge upstairs, great views, cheap booze..  Go down the stairs a bit and you can duck into a really wonderful big room, great sound, beautiful vibe.  The people there have been some of the best crowds I've ever hung with after stumbling out of a club at 4:30am.
 
 Fuck I miss London.  (someday I'll live in Shoreditch, I tells ya)

It only takes 20 years for a liberal to become a conservative
without changing a single idea. In an evolving universe,
who stands still moves backwards.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] rumors there will be an ATLANTIS 2006

the last atlantis i went to, the entire ambient mafia spun at. 
we snuck in water bottles full of vodka.  i'm talking like 10
water bottles.  

the mafia got seriously CRUNKED.  there was throwing up,
passing out, underage girls on e rolling around on the floor
like pigs in a sty.

thugs were giving the love to harken.  someone threw a
half-full can of redbull at superstar DJ keoki and hit him in
the head.

good times.

Subject: [sfraves] "It's All Gone Pete Tong"    (DVD review)

In this mockumentary fable set in the dance scene, a pathetically arrogant (yet loveable) Ibiza
superstar blows out his brain on drugs and liquor, and his eardums on the music.

Gone completely deaf, our hero battles his manager,  the industry,  groupies (including his wife),
and the dancers that become demons when he can no longer mix for shit.  

In some of the film's funniest moments of idiocy , it's hard to tell if our superstar
vinyl-slinger is deaf or stupid, or both.

In the saddest, he describes the familiar passion that lead to his broken eardrums:  "I love them
both:  DJing, and hearing."

In terms of film production, there are many aesthetically-pleasing moments of audio-visual play
centered around deafness and hearing; at the same time toying with our concept of  "feeling"  or
"seeing" the music.   And aof course, it wouldn't be a rave movie without a double-meaning in the
theme of becoming isolated in madness from overconsumption of the scene.

It's not an award winner, but it should be a decent semi-cult, semi-classic when we are all
shouting at each other like 90 year old war veterans.

I'ver never heard of this movie until last week.  And no, this is not a film about Pete Tong.  The
title refers to an expression from British rhyming slang.  

But there are cameos by superstars like Tiesto (the techno antichrist), Whathisname Van Dyke and a
bunch of other industry stars who thankfully I have never heard of but apparantly play their own
real badass selves.  Available on DVD.

peace,
boomerang

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Regarding Lurking . . . .

Hey Good Lurkin!

LA RULEZ!! (Very good UG scene here actually ... like the wherehouse parties
I've been going to lately... downtown LA wherehouse district with all partiers
shuttled in via Vans from places with convenient free/cheap parking... even
the UG's are big parties... big enough to have the Mutaytor perform...
The massives are completely over-the-top here. Check out
http://www.giantvillage.com for example.)

Why is SCR dead? I wonder if other So-Cal folk are going to show up here? Or
have we given up on email and are all on tribe??

-- Niels
    http://nielsmayer.com

PS: by the way, this is fucking cool -- http://www.pandora.com -- it even
knows who John Tejada is (I'm listing to "John Tejada" radio, which is basically
a playlist of songs it things are like John Tejada). Sometimes it's actually 
dead-on. For example the Lawnchair Generals can be Tejada-like & in-fact it 
suggested a L.G. track I often play alongside a Tejada track... kinda cool that 
it thinks like I do ... this could be a useful DJ tool ... if you need hints on 
songs that might mix well with a given track or artist currently playing.
(It would be cool if this was a plugin into Reaktor or Traktor 3.0 :-))

yes, but pantsing a "superstar" DJ in front of a huge crowd, during  
his set, would be funny.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Something to keep in mind

There are scores of hangover cures advertised on the internet, from Dr Ralph's Monday Medicine to Nux Vomica, a homoeopathic remedy that claims to do just what it says on the tin. But few if any of them work, researchers say.
 
                                                  The authors of a study in the British Medical Journal said: "No compelling evidence exists to suggest that any complementary or conventional intervention is effective for treating or preventing alcohol hangover."
 
 
  Taking a couple of paracetamols and a pint of water before bed is too simple for most seeking relief from a night's hard drinking. Bananas, barley grass, cabbage, charcoal tablets, eggs, exercise, green tea, hair of the dog (more alcohol), kidney dialysis, milkshake and Vegemite on toast are among recommended remedies.
 
 
  A search of the medical literature revealed 15 trials of hangover cures, from the blood pressure drug propanolol to a herbal treatment containing extract of artichoke. Most of the trials, which tested eight agents in all, showed no beneficial effect. However, the researchers, led by Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter, found encouraging results for borage, a herbal remedy with anti-inflammatory properties, a product based on dried yeast called Morning Fit and tolfenamic acid, a painkiller. Professor Ernst said a major problem preventing development of an effective cure for hangovers was the lack of information about the effect of alcohol on the body.
  "We don't understand the mechanism of what a hangover is. We know it has to do with the toxic effects of alcohol and dehydration but we don't know how it works."

Would you prefer I swilled Budweiser? Because I do that too...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] "It's All Gone Pete Tong" (DVD review)

Time Warner Cable here in New York City has this flick as a freeby
right now on their 'on demand' but they won't let you record it for

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

wow, is it already friday?  since i leave my computer on all the time  
i had this as one of my background windows i didn't even know it was  
there.

enjoy!  merry christmas if you celebrate it.  or perhaps even if you  
don't, as the quote suggests.

--

I am sure that I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has  
come round...as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant  
time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when  
men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely.

- Charles Dickens

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Roll Call

I'm not a big fan of patron, myself. I have a problem with tequila. It
seems to uhm... want to leave out the same door it came in.

Would definitely go for a maker's mark manhattan. I like maker's mark.
I'm also a big fan of cutty sark, which is a great sipping whiskey on
the rocks.

i used to be a bartender at a tequila bar in SJ.  boy, those were some 
fun days.

my faves are

straight:
Gran Centenario Anejo
Jose Cuervo Reserva de la Familia

for mixing:
Cazadores Reposado

at the end of my shift, i used to take my Nalgene bottle and make 
myself a gigantic 32 oz top shelf Cosmo. i'm surprised my liver even 
works anymore.

Good tequilla is one of the few things I can drink these days.
 
 There's supposedly a new tequilla bar in SOMA, Tres Agave or something and the bar is run by the same guy that does Tommy's out in the Avenues.
 
 In other news, my coworker just retunred from a tequilla tour in Mexico with Sammy Hagar.  I'm not joking.
 
 Regards,
 
 Peter

Sammy Hagar's music might suck - but I love that Cabo Wabo tequila of his. 
That shit makes a perfect margarita or Tequila Sunrise...

HardDesertTrance is the shit.  I fucking love that mix.  I like 2 as well, =
3
i dont really remember so it must not have been that good i just remember i=
t
having that damn pistolwhip track on it.  But 1 fucking owns me.  That is
what trance is for me.  That shit takes me on a journey to the dark
netherworlds of psychedelia.  Whe my car got broken into in Halloween, the
one bright side of it was, on the way to the party my GF asked that i put i=
n
something else before the party so i took my harddesertrance cd out and put
in STP thus saving my fav mix from being stolen along with my stereo.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: The Surface of the Sun

"The composition and  mechanical inner workings of the sun beneath the visible photosphere have  remained an enigma for thousands of years.   There are a whole host of  unexplainable phenomena related to the sun's activities that still baffle gas  model theorists to this  day because they  fail to recognize the existence of an iron alloy  transitional layer that rests beneath the visible photosphere.  Fortunately  a host of new satellites and the field of  heliosiesmology are starting to shed light on this mysterious  transitional layer of the sun that is located about 4800km beneath the visible  photosphere.  In addition, studies of solar wind suggest that  solar wind also originates on the same transition layer under the photosphere.   NASA's SOHO satellite and the Trace satellite program have both imaged this  transition layer of the sun that sits beneath the  photosphere.  These 21st century satellites and  technologies now enable us to peer behind the outer plasma layers of the  chromosphere and photosphere and  allow us to study the rocky, calcium ferrite transitional layer with incredible  precision."

Hello,

Thought someone might be interested in this.  It's currently in Sac, but I

If you're interested, reply to this email address or call me at

Thanks!

i'm just going to go ahead and post this just because i don't really  
understand it.  is it derogatory in some way?

maybe some of you SFRavErs, who are probably much smarter than i, can  
explain to me, and the world of SFR-ness, the deeper, more subtle  
meaning of this quote, and perhaps the original origin.

because i'm too lazy to look it up and i'm in a hurry to pick someone  
up from the airport right now.

Hey gang.  This is for the mid-90's crowd from the sounds of it.

 

I've uploaded a sample of a track that is a remix of an old piece originally
done by Philidelphia 5.  The sample is here: 

http://djdragnfly.com/Orgasm.mp3

                                     

Can anyone id the track and who remixed it?

Subject: [sfraves]nrr: How to get Final Scratch Software??

Hello All,

I know there are some final scratch users out there. 
I FINALLY got my hands on final scratch via Ebay, and
it is complete except the seller did not include the
software!  Any idea on how I can obtain a copy?  I
will be happy with 1.0, 1.1, or 1.5.  I just really
want to get this thing fired up.  It seems to be in
great shape, but you never can tell.  

Things are kinda on hold anyway cuz my needles are
totally shot.

Anyway, I can only find upgrades online and no full
software...

If you might be able to hook me up with a copy, I
could drop a twelve pack off at your house, or slap a
cool 20 bucks in your palm...

Thanks All.

fable....

PS...What is even worse is, I need some new needles
before I can even get started...argh!  TWO
obstacles!!!  At least the needles are easier to come by.

Hey where did you get that BSP from? Why is Hardcore For The People shorted

If you could put it the way they have it on the flyer that would be awesome.
Thanks

Nick

Some of the money that was donated ended up getting pocketed by the people at the gate too.  It was all very chaotic and I personally saw one person pocket the money I had handed her.  I decided not to make a big deal out of it at the time, but I am pretty certain I wasn't the only person this happened to.
 
 Next year that entry gate needs to managed better if you guys want to keep this thing going...
 
 Regards,
 
 Peter

Tequila actually tastes better as it gets shittier.  Like, Jose Cuervo 
Gold > 1800 > Patron.  Patron sucks, I think it's actually an elaborate 
scam.  Herradura + Tres Generaciones + and that crap Sammy Hagar makes are 
good, but in general, like, cheap tequila is tastier and less likely to 
taste like a sour ashtray.  Tequila should ideally be drunk when already 
shitfaced, have nowhere to be for like 5 days, are with your coworkers, 
and forced down your throat in large quanities, and then head shaken by 
crazy people blowing whistles while your new best friends all cheer and 
laugh knowing you're gonna puke soon.  A lot.  But only if God is merciful 
and doesn't let your body keep doing things while your brain is on 
[f|s]iesta.  In fact, it should be a tagline...

Cheap Tequila is Just Better - 1,000,000 unplanned pregnancies after three 
day weekends in Tijuana/Mexicali/Rosarita Beach/Ensenada can't be wrong.

Um. Please tell me that's sarcasm. PLEASE.

Cheap liquor is made for bums. Anything below top-shelf is a waste of time

Better than on a DJM600.

So yes. It's entirely possible to scratch on a Xone...

Does depend on which fader caps they have on the fader(s) though.

As much as those mutherfuckers cost - it better be!!!

Oddly enough, I checked out some shitty looking American Audio mixer the 
other day at a friend's house. It looked like the atypical bargain mixer. 
But holy fuck - everything about it sounded great, felt great, the faders 
had the most bitching curve adjustment, etc.

I was so blown away I am honestly considering selling my mixer to get 
one...for $200 - it makes Pioneer look like a Gemini kit mixer. No shit.

Hmmmm....NYE and a Xone:62 mixer you must be playing on the SWATSound
System...hahaha, that silly Marshallllllll.

No you can't really scratch on the Xone:62.  It has a very smooth curve on
the x-fader.  I don't know if you ever met or seen my friend/former roommat=
e
scratch.  He's very good, Bad Boy Bill-ish good, and he could barely scratc=
h
on that mixer.  The problem is you have to flick the fader so far over just
to get enough of the sound to come through that a lot of the times
you basically cut all the way across.  If you're really damn good you can d=
o
some fairly basic scratching, but nothing fancy like triplets or crabbing o=
r
anything like that.  It's purely a studio/trance mixer....nice and smooth
from side to side.

Also, make sure you dont accidentally hit the x-fader button or it gets eve=
n
worse, as you move the x-fader across the side your playing will get quiete=
r
as you get closer to the middle rather then staying the same volume until
you get to the middle.  There have been times we've listened to some DJ and
for some reason the mixes were sounding funny, the music would get quieter
and then louder and back n forth during the mixes and we'd walk up and sure
enough they hit the x-fader button thinking it would make it a shaper cut,
which it doesnt.

Oh and one last thing....use the pretty blue lights sparingly.  The PCF
curve tweak knobby thingies get annoying real quick.  Specially when someon=
e
doesn't know how to use em and have the knob turned the wrong way and they
think they're gonna do something cool and in fact it does the exact opposit=
e
of what they wanted to do.  Oh and beware of fader flicking on the x-fader
and the lateral faders as the knobs like to fly off at high speeds.

Other then that it's a pretty solid mixer.  it's held up to lost of parties
and still works like a charm.  I wouldnt buy one for myself as it's cost to
feature aspects are severelly out of proportion, but it's a solid mixer non=
e
the less.

The fader is nice. I think it's the same thing I have in my Rane. I'm 
sure it has a curve too. Although I think it's the kind you'll find on a 
Pioneer DJM600. Not a dial you can adjust any way you like. I think it's 
a switch with three curve options. Fast, slow, and somewhere in between.

Hmmmm....NYE and a Xone:62 mixer you must be playing on the SWATSound
System...hahaha, that silly Marshallllllll.

No you can't really scratch on the Xone:62.  It has a very smooth curve on
the x-fader.  I don't know if you ever met or seen my friend/former roommate
scratch.  He's very good, Bad Boy Bill-ish good, and he could barely scratch
on that mixer.  The problem is you have to flick the fader so far over just
to get enough of the sound to come through that a lot of the times
you basically cut all the way across.  If you're really damn good you can do
some fairly basic scratching, but nothing fancy like triplets or crabbing or
anything like that.  It's purely a studio/trance mixer....nice and smooth
from side to side.

Also, make sure you dont accidentally hit the x-fader button or it gets even
worse, as you move the x-fader across the side your playing will get quieter
as you get closer to the middle rather then staying the same volume until
you get to the middle.  There have been times we've listened to some DJ and
for some reason the mixes were sounding funny, the music would get quieter
and then louder and back n forth during the mixes and we'd walk up and sure
enough they hit the x-fader button thinking it would make it a shaper cut,
which it doesnt.

Oh and one last thing....use the pretty blue lights sparingly.  The PCF
curve tweak knobby thingies get annoying real quick.  Specially when someone
doesn't know how to use em and have the knob turned the wrong way and they
think they're gonna do something cool and in fact it does the exact opposite
of what they wanted to do.  Oh and beware of fader flicking on the x-fader
and the lateral faders as the knobs like to fly off at high speeds.

Other then that it's a pretty solid mixer.  it's held up to lost of parties
and still works like a charm.  I wouldnt buy one for myself as it's cost to
feature aspects are severelly out of proportion, but it's a solid mixer none
the less.

wow, i can't believe you're actually good for something!

so i checked the AH site and you're right.  the crossfader adjust has
two settings:  cut and dip.

and as Gavin said...that crossfader can either have the standard fader
cap or that annoying wide and flat cap that you see on some volume
faders.

I'm completely with AndyW on this one. You've been served (no pun intended)=
.

There's only one type of tequila, and that's the type that makes you
vomit uncontrollably after drinking too much.

Oh, and patron sucks balls. I hate it. makes me sick.

Normal people puke after drinking too much of any kind of alcohol, not sure 
what planet you're from!

Good tequila doesn't taste like ass. Cheap tequila tastes like ass.
Therefore, Good tequila is not Cheap tequila.

Patron is so-so for me.  Cuervo is grate after Brita X 5.

I think its important to keep in mind that a Welsh man died earlier this year afer winning a tequila drinking contest.
 
 But if you choose to ignore these facts, you may bow down before the tequila priestess.
 
 Of course everyone has their own tequila story.  
 
 Peace,

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Monday Night/ Tuesday Monrning Adventure

So I got this job on like Sunday night... & started Monday morning... the
boss/ owner/ CEO dude picked me up in his car, bought me coffee that
morning.. Mind u, this job's in Campbell in the South Bay & yes.. we
discussed my commute & all that prior, so it was all good.. but the whole
picking me up my 1st day kinda threw me off, ya know?

Anywaze.. work day came, went, la la la... the CEO dude was away in
meetings all day, gets back, the 1st thing he asked me when he got in (no
lie), "So how you getting home tonight?"

I mean.. i understand that i shouldn't assume that just cause some1 picks
me up, that don't mean they wren't gonna take me back home... but usually
they tell me right away that they can't & I usually make my way.. but
yeah...

He drops me off @ the Cal Train Station around 7:30PM... I wait 4 like 2
hours... OK.. i know i'm lame 4 this.. but i didn't have the CEO's cell #
on me.. i kinda left it on my comp @ home... & well. i didn't have any of
any1's like phone #'s who live in the Southbay... I mean.. i didn't think
I was gonna need more than like well.. I dunno... but well.. i just didn't
think of preparing myself w/ anything extra that what i already had w/
me... well.. i guess it would be a good idea to bring around an address/
phone # book w// me in my bag...

So after several attempts of calling people & my parents, I was like fuck
it.. then i saw that strip mall across the street & decided that i should
go there where it's well lit & not stay out in the dark where the station
was... as soon as i got 2 the strip mall, this homeless dude asked me if I
had 50 cents so he could make a phone call... I told him i had 50 cents,
but i needed it 2 make a call.. then he gave me this long ass story about
like how he had to talk to his ex girlfriend's cousin about goin' 2 her
house to talk 2 his ex about his Mom who was is a coma.. well.. I dunno
man.. i was like thinkin' & kinda sympathized & i had some cas i could
easliy change, so I gave it 2 him... he used the phone, called, then we
talked somemore.. i told him my whole missing Cal Train thing & how my new
boss la la la... then i asked him if i can like kick it w/ him & he said
yeah... so we just hung out!

So we end3d up going 2 his ex girlfriends cousins pad arund the corner
from the strip mall... soh yeah.. this guys name is Jack.. the ex-gf's
cousin, her name is Jessica, so she meets us outside, calls her cousin,
Jack's ex-gf, & they talk on the phone for like 1/2 hour... he cries &
laugh.. this whole time, I talk w/ Jessica, pick well.. what i thought
were really deformed awesomely huge lemons off a tree, & well. talk 2
Jessica more!  Then the 3 of us chiull in her car for a while talking...
they asked me about my life, they told me about theirs...

Jack suggested we go kick it down town if i got hella hours 2 wait 4 Cal
Train 2 open up again & he needed 2 go down there anyway.. so we walk over
a mile to the lightrail station...

OK... so for the next several hours, we visit some of his friends, go to
like the 24/7 resturaunts donw there 2 talk 2 people (& there really isn't
much), we went 2 these abandoned houses & kick it there, hide from cops, I
mean, it was a fun fuckin' time & I was pretty safe 'cause Jack made sure
i waws OK the whole time!  By the time like 9 PM hit, we went
WinerSnicitchel on ummm... 1st i think & just say down & talked somemore
b4 I went my way & he went his...

By 9:30 i was on Lightrail & started the whole commute thing... I got back
2 Hercules around 2 seomthing, almost 3PM... LoL.. but it was the best
fuckin' time I've had in a long time!  LOL!  YAY!  OK.. just thought i'd
share!

---OK.. u don't have 2 read this... I"m just venting now, but Hello
2Day!!! ----

Oh yeah.. so anywaze, this new job thing... I didn't get fired, but my
employment is frozen w/ the company.. reason being that when me & the CEO
dude spoke on Sunday night, I told him the soonest i'd be able to make it
out was during the latter part of the week, like Wed-Friday to start
training.. but he insisted I come out on Monday for training, but we
agreed that I couldn't come in on Tuesday so i could do a day of homework
& come back in on Wed... well.. when he called me on Tuesday evening, i
told him the whole story about Cal Train & la la la.. OK.. he got pissed @
me.. he told me I wasn't using my common sense, he said i was very
irresponsible, he told me I used poor judgements on my decisions in
handling being stranded, he said my family was lame & worthless if they
weren't even gonna come & pick me up like ummm, 80 plus miles away from
Hercules (I did call my house like 3 times from the pay phone 2 try 2 tell
my Mom what happen w/ Cal Train), & he called me stupid basically... but
honestly.. everything he accused me of not doing, i did or i tried, well
granted, I didn't have anyone's phone #s of the South bay people...

But i thought he would understand that my school stuff is important 2 me &
i do need time 2 do this stuff 4 my school, ya know?  I mean, it'snot my
fault he was a high school drop out & never looked back & doesn't
understand those of us going back 2 school 2 get degrees & shit... & I
wanted 2 help himn out as  afavor 'cause he is always streesssed about not
having enough help & all this shit...

But when things went the way they did & I did have alot of failed attempts
@ like tryin' 2 cover my ass 4 being stranded... I mean.. I did what i
usually do when i'm stuck & just roll with a train of thought & survive
somehow 'cause I alwasy seem 2 get in these situations.. no biggie 4 me...
but apparetnly the CEO dude had a problem w/ that.. so i dunno... although
my employment w/ his company is on hold rightnow.. I'm not sure i wanna go
back actaully... I mean... this CEO dude is so fucki'n self centered that
he thinks he always right!  He excpeted me to be on his frame of
mentallity throughtout this whole ordeal or atleast be prepared 4 it... I
mean... I do what i can when I situation calls for it & it's usually just
liike whatever i can find what to do, ya know???  It kinda hurt when he
was putting me down 4 my sttempts @ atleast being safe the whole 13 hours
I was kinda going along w/ the flow.. many people who have hung out w/ me
on the weekends know about this!  LOL

So yeah... my 1st day w/ that company is sadly my last!  I mean.. it was
set up so that I would stay in the Southbay like 3-4 nights outta the week
'cause he set up an apartment for me 2 stay in & shit.. but I dunno... i'm
gonan look for a different gig now i guess.. LoL.. Hello2Day! Wow!

I guess lesson learned.. HELLO 2DAY, bring in a list of phone#'s of every1
I know just I"m stuck in your part of the world :)

Wasn't referring to Love Parade.  I was talking about your whining in
regards to the abbreviation of your crew.

Hey where did you get that BSP from? Why is Hardcore For The People shorted 
on it down to HFTP? We often put HCFTP, but that is just for affiliations.
If you could put it the way they have it on the flyer that would be awesome.
Thanks

Nick

wow, i can't believe you're actually good for something!

so i checked the AH site and you're right.  the crossfader adjust has
two settings:  cut and dip.

and as Gavin said...that crossfader can either have the standard fader
cap or that annoying wide and flat cap that you see on some volume
faders.

Alright so I love SF and all I can't ever see moving and the diversity of
music is great and all, but, was back home for Xmas and in ONE FUCKING
WEEKEND I got to see: Heather, Diz, Little Louie Vega, Gene Farris,
Derrick Carter, Dan X, Justin Long, James Curd from Greenskeepers, and
some other locals I love but SF folk probably wouldn' know.  Haven't
danced that much in one weekend for a lonnnggg time.

I don't know how many househeads are actually on this list but talk about
a reneducation, I really wish this city had more of teh straight up jack
and funk and jazz and soul in it's house music. :(  Too much electro and
glitch in the scene for me right now, I like a bit of it but I'm on
overload out here.  Still better than anywhere else in the US though so
whateva.

Deep house is the devil, it's the worst music in the world. I'm all 
about some bangin' funky house, though.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] chicago

No shit - I want to murder BBB for shitting all over good house and making 
people think they have to play 600 records in an hour to be "cool".

But it's wierd to hear people talk about SF not having good house. I mean, 
when I think deep, dubby, tribally house - I think SF.

H-Foundation, Dano, Tony, Garth, Dubtribe, Red Melon, Tango, Siesta, SWAT, 
M3 ....

I guess I don't go out and listen to that much house these days - but I have 
a hard time believing that NO ONE plays that kinda house here anymore. I've 
heard it out at Club 6, Butter, Lingba Lounge and some other spots here and 
there...but is that it?

Has anybody on here ever had to deal with some lame-ass codec called "Spyaxe?" Can't get the damn thing off my comp, and the only removal tool I've found so far wants $39.99. . . . 
   
  HELP!
   
  (Thanks)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] chicago

How ironic! I'm new to this list - I just joined a few weeks ago when
I arrived in Chicago for new job training and in my spare time started
immediately missing the familiar SF dance vibes I had come to know and
love.

I thought about asking for advice on where to start looking for
fantastic danceable music (some house and breaks would be lovely) but
somehow never got round to it. I guess that's why you have to speak up
on these things!

Lesson learned... Advice then, on where to find out what's out there
in this new-to-me city? I'll be back in SF for New Year's, but staying
in Chicago after that until mid-February.

sunshine day!
teresa.

I'm a proponent of having as many genres in a night as possible. I can't 
stand it when I go to a party and it's nothing but breaks.

 Yeah- the passing of IDR hit me nearly as hard as the shit-ifying of the Top.  Two institutions that meant "San Francisco" going down in rather quick succession.  With the advent of mega-coke-culture and the bleep-bloopifying of the music to the detriment of its musicality, the ug house club scene has begun more and more to resemble the ratty, bratty cousin of mainstream clubbing, instead of the primal, connected experience it had been at IDR, Come-Unity, and related parties.  This has been either a revelation or a curse, depending on who you ask.  Your shoes *will* get more attention now, if they're fly.  Just don't expect to stumble out of 6 as the sun comes up having made 4 new friends and danced your ass off all night.
 
 I love bleepy house, don't get me wrong, but it feels like there are some social changes neccesary in the cold, hard electro-clashy culture it seems to be coddling.  When I go to rock or punk shows these days I see much the same thing.  Posturing poseurs flaunting elaborate getups and even more elaborately practiced sneers and goose-step crack dancing.  Who wants that on the dance floor?  Does anyone here get a charge out of that?  Am I missing the point?
 
 I read someplace recently that Pink has replaced The Top for a lot of people.  I wish I could understand why.  $400 bottles of bubbly proudly hocked from mirrored signs, fashion-centric vibe, less than inspiring soundsystem, dj up on a pedestal, the whole place being too clean and modern-design-y to inspire any level of kickbackery..
 
 To me, on a good night there are many many small clubs in the city that could have taken that mantle.  Hell, UGSF itself could have learned from its mistakes and regained its crowd instead of fracturing off into whatever it's doing.  Anu can be downright cosy and vibey on a good night.  Even Wish, Butter, etc have their good times.  Oh well.
 
 I feel like I'd better get a prison tattoo of an eagle with lightning bolts in its mouth across my arm if I'mma be cool right now..

 Deep house as it's been co-opted by the supa-vocal-smooth-R&B-but-wait-it's-got-a-weak-house-beat-let's-call-it-house crowd, I'll agree, IS the devil.  Makes me unproud to call myself a house producer.  Deep house in the Chicago, SF, even London (sometimes) tradition is, well, pretty damn sublime.  Without the deep you wouldn't notice how bangin' the funky shit is, anyway.  You'd be at 100% all the time- that's no kind of listening experience..
 
 (unless you're into hardcore, which actually IS the devil..  ;) ;) ;) ;) *wink* *nudge* *j/k*
 
 Argh,

Any warehouse with high ceilings and a big sound system.  I'm not really
partial to any clubs but I would prefer to go to places with top notch soun=
d
like 1015, Mighty and Mezzanine.  Primal/Get Underground used to have some
sick parties at Club 6, but when the lower room gets going, the ceiling
starts dripping with sweat and it starts to feel more like a steam room tha=
n
a club.

Fav party at the moment, albeit it only happens about 1-2x / year is
Markie's Alumni Parties, althought I just wish he would do it somewhere
other than DNA Lounge.

Raindance has done some crazy parties in the last year as well, even though
they tend to cater more to a breaks audience.

The things I like about SF House: the trippy psychedellic, acid, funk
driven, deeeeep organic stuff mixed in with funky, acid and electro breaks.

The things I dislike:  bouncey bounce house from texas that has infected SF
which caters to a more yuppiefied house audience; ie Joey Youngman + others
have totally infected SF and ruined one of my fav labels;
Tango/Nightshift/Detour
And Om Records!  I used to like this label- and they do still put out some
decent stuff, but the majority of deep house on there now totally boooores
me.... like kaskades stuff.. zzzzz

NO SHIT! I cannot stand the "faux hawk" massive. I realize music and fashion 
go hand in hand - but fuck fashionistas. The whole concept of styling 
yourself to a musical genre is just LAME.



"I love bleepy house, don't get me wrong, but it feels like there are some 
social changes neccesary in the cold, hard electro-clashy culture it seems 
to be coddling.  When I go to rock or punk shows these days I see much the 
same thing.  Posturing poseurs flaunting elaborate getups and even more 
elaborately practiced sneers and goose-step crack dancing.  Who wants that 
on the dance floor?  Does anyone here get a charge out of that?  Am I 
missing the point?"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] your favorite house nights, venues, djs

I don't know enough about the house scene here to say - but...

DJ's/Producers:
M3
Iz & Diz
Garth
Mark Farina (I still love him - u can all fuck off)
East Coast Boogiemen
Dano
Jeno
Danny Tenaglia

and on the techy/electro-y or proggy tip(s):
John Tejada
John Acqaviva
Lee Burridge
Craig Richards
James Zabiela


I like those sorts of folks cuz they tend to really work mixes. Take your 
ears and feet on a journey. That's why I can't stand DJs like BBB - it's 
just this relentless pounding with cheesey "quick" mixes. And WAY too fast. 
I like my house at like - 128 bpm's tops. None of this 130 and up crap. 
That's for breakbeats dammit. I like DJs who bring a groove to the floor. If 
I wanted pounding beats - I'd go for straight up techno....

That's why I love Markie's Alumni parties.  Before EDM was completely
splintered into all these subgenre's you could hear a mix of house, techno,
trance (the good shit IMO!) and breakbeats all being played in the same roo=
m
over the period of the night.  That's also why I love dj's like Jeno, Garth
and Francois K, they're not scared to dig deep into the crates and shy away
from what the crowd expects a dj to spin.  Which just reminded me I have a
mix of LTJ bukem from 1991i found recently spinning straight up house  :)))=

All the NYE fixins and a sanctuary of music, vibe and people on NYE.

9pm- till you stop dancing
DNA Lounge
375 11th St. @ Harrison St.


Main:

9-10 Shanti
10-11 Fred Funk
11-12 Hoj
12-2 Lee Coombs
2-3:30 Dylan Rhymes
3:30-4:30 Bassbin Twins
4:30-6 Aaron Jae vs. Bam
6-? Open for whatever happens...

Up:

10:30-11:55 Ethan Miller v. Viajay
12:05-1:15 Melyss
1:15-2:30 Scott Carrelli
2:30-4:15 Jondi & Spesh
4:15-5:30 Syd Gris


Light Dancing and other performance art, midnight ceremony and
countdown, complimentary champagne toast, 2 rooms of breaks, house,
progressive and trance, lounge areas, ins and outs all night, visuals
by On the Fly Films, outdoor smoking area, NYE party favors, free
breakfast at 5am, decor by the Opulent Temple and Analogia.

The NYE tix update: If you're still undecided take note our party is
guaranteed quality in terms of crowd, vibe, and price. Other all-
night NYE parties with this much to offer are anywhere between $70 and
a $100, ours is $50 and will stay there. There's still around 20 $40
tix left at BPM. Their hours today are 11-7. They won't last long!
Then they're $50 there, as well as on line but getting them at BPM
saves you the service charge if you can make it down there. On line
tix available   HERE.

Pre-sales are recommended. You are guaranteed entry anytime even if we
sell out (and we might, actually), and you use your own VIP express
line (not the general admission line). If you already have tix well
done! If you're spending midnight with us (we hope you are!), give
yourself plenty of time to park and get in.

We're seriously going to rock it.

-&e-> 
-&e-> I feel like I'd better get a prison tattoo of an eagle with 
-&e->lightning bolts in its mouth across my arm if I'mma be cool right 
-&e->now..

OMG, did what I've been doing the last like 10 years just become cool?  I 
TOTALLY WRITE BLIP!  I'VE WRITTEN SOFTWARE THAT WRITES BLIP FOR ME EVEN!!  
Now I just need to get a bad tatoo of an eagle holding a bleeding heart in 
one talon and crushing a beercan with the other?

"what does your tatoo mean anti-w?"

"it doesn't mean anything to me baby, just like you. just keep sucking 
and try not to move your head up too much, it skips the decks"

Pickup lines like "nice shoes babe, they'd look great next to mine on the 
floor of a cheap motel" and "hey baby, you look kinda tweaky... you know 
what takes the edge off that TOO MUCH COCAINE feeling baby?  More 
cocaine... you know you want it, I'm Hollywood actor Beck Bristow".

News flash... the trance and techno scene grew in the SF underground out 
of the vacous and superficial house club scene of the time.  Ask anybody 
who was there... when I came into all this it was almost antifashion.  A 
raver was visually identified as less a fashion and more just a couple 
little cues (their pants a little wide, the ball chained wallet, the hoody 
and the crooked grin walking home at 8am).  Someone wearing designer this 
and that out the ass was actually seen as somewhat of an outcast.  All 
things in cycles.  The 16-19 year old cheese kids have now left the trance 
massives and are the 22-25 year old beautiful people of the clubs.  
Enjoy.

We identified with E cause we hated coke.  Now E is passe, people have 
more opinions on beverages in an average night than meaningful encounters 
aside from hookups and comparing notes on that girl that just walked by.

As for dark music, well... I love my music minimal, it opens up the places 
that mean the most for me, let's me walk around inside my head.  I miss 
music being a bit more tracky, but the sound you're talking about and what 
I'm referring to a little bit different I think (I'm thinking like "No 
Way Back" by Adonis).  Repetitive, simple, hypnotic, yet funky... very 
electronic and angular with little in the way of "real" sounding strings 
or bass or horns or anything.  But still mostly house.  Like 4am jack 
business.

Golly, wish I was playing house somewhere next month... *whistles*

Turns out the stars are like with me and I got a favorable slot for what I 
play, on a sound system I love playing on.   I'm still deciding on whether 
I should have more fun and play records, or be a little bit more original 
and play live... if anybody is going and has a preference lemme know.

I'm not sure who the Usual Suspects are but as far as I've always known, 
Jack Dangers IS Meat Beat Manifesto.

I have to admit, that's one area where moving from LA to SF has surprised
me...
the lack of deep thumpin' house on the weeknights. In my mind I have this
expectation of the "San Francisco Sound" and yet most of the house I've
heard has been way techier than deep.

>From door to door, my commute takes approximately 90 minutes, perfect for a
nice 90 minute set. Tuesday I listened to a friend's set from an innerweb
radio show I listen to dated 7/22/02 and realized how much of it was what
I'd classify as "San Francisco" house... a few Greyhound tracks, and of
course the classic "hangin' out" jam from Jay-J that I love so much. And
then I thought, hmm. No naked. In the four months I've lived here, I have
not heard a *single* Naked producer/dj spin out. Come to think of it, very
few OM djs either, and none from Moulton or Loveslap. I must remedy this.

Could it be that the sound of San Francisco House is changing?

I thought OM did a weekly or monthly gig at DNA Lounge.

I have seen Miggs and other Naked dj's/producers on fliers - mebbee yer 
missing them?

I do notice the frequency of acts like Garth & Jeno seems to have gone 
down - but I was under the assumption they were kinda laying low these days 
anyway.

Househeads?!?!?!

I have to admit, that's one area where moving from LA to SF has surprised
me...
the lack of deep thumpin' house on the weeknights. In my mind I have this
expectation of the "San Francisco Sound" and yet most of the house I've
heard has been way techier than deep.

>From door to door, my commute takes approximately 90 minutes, perfect for a
nice 90 minute set. Tuesday I listened to a friend's set from an innerweb
radio show I listen to dated 7/22/02 and realized how much of it was what
I'd classify as "San Francisco" house... a few Greyhound tracks, and of
course the classic "hangin' out" jam from Jay-J that I love so much. And
then I thought, hmm. No naked. In the four months I've lived here, I have
not heard a *single* Naked producer/dj spin out. Come to think of it, very
few OM djs either, and none from Moulton or Loveslap. I must remedy this.

Could it be that the sound of San Francisco House is changing?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] your favorite house nights, venues, djs

The Liquid:
One place I used to be totally addicted to was the
Liquid (near 16th), but that was a few years ago when
DJ Dave was resident (and there was another white guy
dj-ing with him but I don't know his name, if anyone
knows please tell). The type of music played was
house/progressive house (but not the funky type, more
like dark or tribal). The crowd was also very varied
and fun.
Then the Liquid got bought by new owners (French I
believe), and the atmosphere totally changed (it feels
snobish now, I could develop why), the DJs have
changed and the music I learnt to love at the Liquid
seems to not be played anymore there. 

If anyone knows where DJ Dave (and his white buddy
whose name I don't know) are now mixing I would love
to now !!!

The 1015:
Never really liked it, feels like a fitness center to
make asian kids jump. The music is rather commercial
in the big room and pretty much sucks. The other rooms
are sometimes better (and more Housey !) but quality
varies and there's no real consistency.

111 Minna Street Gallery
Sometimes there's some good house and good crowds
there (Qool parties).

Club6:
The place is event based, so it's a bit a hit or miss,
I went to some exceptional parties with hypnotic
progressive house ruling the night with a packed dance
floor. But then I also went to parties other there
with boring music and empty dancefloors and very
little people staying...

Since the dot com era I am having a horrible time locating reliable and
responsible staff. All I ever seem to locate is thieves, con artists,
drug addicts, flakes, irresponsible adults that have less of a clue than
most 13 year olds. Does anyone know where to locate good  reliable
technical staff that actually know what a job is, and the
responsibilities they must uphold. I am now really beginning to
understand why many of my colleagues have gone solo! Is there any light
at the end of the tunnel?

=20

I have used Craig's list, but seem to notice the only people on there
that are not employed..... is because there is a very good reason, THEY
SUCK!=20

=20

What's everyone's opinion of interns from local schools and
universities? Do they often work out for long term positions? I am so
tired of the new-hire and employee retention headaches. Maybe it's time
to start doing more outsourcing and use recruiters again :-(=20

The military has already achieved this.  I forget the name of the hardware,
but they've achieved success by attaching sensors to the head of the testee=
,
and then the testee was able control a flight simulator simply by thought.
I believe they were simple auronautical maneuvers, nothing too incredible a=
t
this point in time.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR> Where do all the good employees exist?

because, according to your last post, the Mafia has a contract out on you?
I'm not working for you!

;)

Interns?  IMO, everyone in the IT tech industry (as opposed to IT 
support for another
industry) is treated like an intern.   So much work == mandatory 
overtime, rotten pay,
the threat of H1Bs taking your job (because they're happy to be 
treated like an intern)
The tech industry is basically slave labor and the idea of a union 
for tech people is a good
one, but won't ever fly for various reasons.    Anyone with any sense 
becomes a contractor

And recruiters are evil.  The last one was using NLP on me to beat my 
ego down so I'd accept
a $35 / hr job.   And I have a goddamn Master's

At least in the UK, I get a month's vacation right from the start, 6 
weeks after a few years and
some respect for my master's from one of the top 5 unis in all of Europe.

try offering people a month's vacation and ignore most everything but 
their attitude.   There's
too many tech people in CA with a bad attitude.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Fri)

Tomorrow's quote of the day will be a Special Saturday Quote of the  
Day, the final one of 2005, and it will be brought to you by Will  
Penna!  *PSST*!  Will, I just volunteered you!

Anyway, I arrived at SFO at 10:15 AM this morning, taking the new  
United Premium non-stop service from JFK to SFO.  All the seats are  
Economy Plus, meaning you have more leg room, and you get two meals!   
Yum!

Unfortunately, as Gatekeeper of our fine city, I will be writing  
scathing letters to all the powers that be with the BART to SFO  
Caltrain connection.  Look what happens, I leave for a couple years  
and the whole place falls apart!  Sheez.  So don't worry about that,  
fine citizens, I will take care of that for you, and then pass on  
information for those that are interested in participatory, rather  
than thin democracy.

Yea, yea, I know.  Choose your battles.

Anyway, I'd like to hear from you while I'm in town.  Yes, you!   
Reading this email.  So get in touch, and we'll see what's up!

Don't ruin my whisky with ice! I'm not a bloody American!

We dance for laughter, we dance for tears, we dance for madness, we dance for fears, 

we dance for hopes, we dance for screams, we are the dancers, we create the dreams.

Love,

Many thanks to all of you sfravers for the b-day greetings.  Haven't seen most of you for quite a spell.  Miss you.  This has been an Annus Horribilis for my partner and I...and for lots of other folks.

Every time my birthday comes around one tune fires in my brain and takes over for a day or two:  "Sixteen Tons."  I can sing all the lyrics from beginning to end...a literal description of the coal miners' plight and a metaphor for "workers" with blue or modern white collars.  The "company store" is now the mortgage and credit card bank :-)

And so the chorus:  



You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store




Merle Travis wrote and released the song in 1947 and Tennesse Ernie Ford popularized it.  "Sixteen Tons" almost immediately began to generate controversy causing Travis  problems in the anti-communist Cold War hysteria of the late forties. Some in government saw songs dealing with workers' woes, and folk music "activists," as potentially subversive. It made no difference that Travis was a patriot. Veteran Capitol producer, Ken Nelson, who worked at WJJD radio in Chicago in the late forties, recalled in a 1992 interview that FBI agents advised the station not to play Travis' records, because they considered him a "communist sympathizer," which was, of course, completely untrue. 

My father was an old-school country and western fan and I suppose I picked up the lyrics, like many other C&W classics, from listening to them with him.  Still love Hank Williams and, of course, the great Johnny Cash.  

This is probably more than you wanted to know about me and "Sixteen Tons."

Wish you all a New Year full of light and love!!

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] chicago

having too many different types of music can be just as annoying if  
not more.  i've always liked the standard configuration of 1 feeding  
1, 2 feeding 2 and 3, like house or whatever the main type of music  
and then a side room with ambient chill out music, and mayybe some  
jungle in a small room as well.   any more than that though, you're  
standing in some dumpy warehouse and all the music coagulates in your  
head and you want to go jump off the nearest bridge.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: How many of you are lurking?

Hello,
De-lurk for a day ON!  Been on this list about 4.5 years now.  It is fun and 
at times informative as to what's going down.  Been partying for about 9 
years now and DJ'ing for about 8.  Some of you know me, some of you may not. 
Happy New Year everyone.  Be safe.

Much Respect,
Darrell

Subject: [sfraves] Available: 3 tix for Opel/DNA tonight

Hi - we have 3 tix for the Opel party at DNA tonight (NYE) we can't use - 
they are " will call" so we need to get 3 people in with them.  If you need 
them, they are $45 each (it is $50 at the door, unless they are already sold 
out) and please call me on my cell at 650-576-3296.  the phone message will 
sound like a business and I won't answer, but leave a message and your phone 
number and I'll call you back so you can meet us at DNA, probably around 
10:30 pm tonight.

Thanks!
Becky

Subject: RE: [sfraves] OW NYE 2006

Presales sold out at Skills too - apparently there was a line waiting for 
the replacements that my roomate took down earlier today.

Seriously - if you haven't concreted your plans for tonight, do yourself a 
favor and head to the Otherworld - it's gonna be off the freakin' chain for 
sure.

If anyone cares - me and my boy (The Mario Bros.) will be reppin' it in the 
upstairs room from 10:15 or so till about 12:15 - 12:30ish!!!

Tech - funk - house - breaks....OH YEA!

HAPPY NEW YEARS TO EVERYONE!!!! RING IT IN SAFE AND HAPPY NO MATTER WHERE 
YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!!!!!!!!!!

Peace & respect,
Marc(O)

as long as we're plugging ourselves...

i'll be on deck after Andy W scares everyone out of the upstairs 
room... and i'm *NOT* playing breaks.  imagine that if you will.

come to think of it, i can't really figure out what to call what i'm 
playing tonight, so if you happen to catch my set, feel free to let me 
know what you think it is... :-)
