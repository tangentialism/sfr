I checked it out this past Friday and bought some good records. Granted, their selection is not huge, they do have quite a few good new releases if you are looking for house/prog stuff. It was right up my alley.

Nope, that wasn't it. People just weren't that into it, in either room. I've
seen hardcore rooms bounce for hours without stopping. Same with jungle. It
wasn't that people were tired from dancing their asses off. It was that it
was crowded, and the HC room had a lot of cross traffic leaving little room
to dance, while the other room was pretty hot. Not too bad though, it wasn't
like the last Imagine. I remember thinking, "Hmmmm, maybe I should have
dropped a pill; I would probably enjoy the party more." But then I thought,
"No, I just need to go to the right parties." This wasn't bad, and I did
dance my ass off, but I did miss the vibe.

    Side Note: I've been learning how to spin, and had a couple of
observations tonight. One was how much more critical I am now about the way
a song sounds, now that I'm used to being able to adjust it. Someone spun
one of my favorite tracks in my miniscule vinyl collection; the label just
says "Holligans of the New School 2." When I heard the beginning of the song
being mixed in, I knew it instantly. The only problem was that it was being
spun waaaaaaay pitched up, like on 45 at the top of the pitch range, while I
spin it on 33. It's a breaks track. It sounds like shit played at HHC speed.
The vocals could shatter glass, and all the sounds of the song are smashed
together. I felt very confident that it was being spun wrong, and that I
knew how to fix it! Lol!
    Also, I was watching someone in the trance room, and within about 10
minutes I saw him NOT mix twice. Meaning, he let one track run out then
started the next one. I felt like that was cheap and that I, as the
audience, deserved more! What makes this all important is the realization
that before I started to learn how to spin, I wouldn't have noticed some of
these things, and while at some level ignorance is bliss, I find that I
enjoy the music so much more now that I've begun to learn the secrets of the
man behind the green curtain.

Happy  :-)

Yah Devotion was jammed packed.

It was good talking to everyone though.  Even though the cops came and let
the party keep going, it was alright. I'm guessing it's because my car got
broken into which is why i'm dampered into my mood.  Not a lot was taken
though because the car alarm was going off.  I guess the music prevented
anyone from hearing it.  It's all good..shit happens.  Either way my vinyl
is still in my hands and nothing is missing from there..

My guess is that the dj you saw let the track run out was Tracer.  He had an
intro to the song he was playing to be heard..hence he let it play out. The
one set i have to compliment is Majerie.  Always giving the "I want to kill
you and put you in a blender mood" type of dark trance.  Made me wanna pound
something and grind it to a pulp.  God I love dark trance..hehe.. anyway
long night.. goodnight. see ya all in the morning.

Pictures are up though..

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Nuked Pot (True Story...LoL)

Over the weekend so far... I was in Guadalupe/ Santa Maria 4 Thanks Giving & 
Fam time (which really annoying @ some points during the trip).  But in 
Santa Maria, they have "The Sun" which is the Free publication there...

anywaze, here's the a small lil' story taken from there:

"Nuked Pot just isn't the same

Chattanooga, Tenn., police had told the city's WTVC-TV in October that they 
had arrested Rudy Raines for possesion of about a pound of marijuana, after 
Raines had allegedly walked nonchalantly into a Fast Food and Fuel 
convenience store, past officer David Sshly, and uninhitedly placed a stash 
of marijuana into the stores microwave oven because, he said, he needed to 
dry it out.  Raines was arrested, along with another man sleeping in his car 
in the parking lot."

LoL.... I told Shane about this story already when I was in the car still... 
lol.... funny shit man!

Grrrrrr... I have to admit though... last week was tough 'cause I didn't go 
dancing all week long man!  So hard!



Take Care,
Later {8O)
Peace-=->Just Me~=~>O§bY

Subject: Re: [sfraves] good record stores in SJ area?

Well as being a long tim patron of Solid and friends with most of the 
co-workers and owners I will try to give an un-biased opinion.

in terms of timeline I could be off here but I dont think solid was even 
around 9 years ago.. I could be mistaken. But I use to buy records from 
Brandon when solid grooves, at that time called "Outer rythm" was run out of 
his own home with Andrian and Joe Harp. And Im thinking it was more like 7 
or 8 years ago? But at anyrate he had a solid underground selection at that 
time even selling lots of tracks from his own personal collection which is 
fucking Awesome I might add. I remember picking up lion rocks Packets of 
Peace remix.. when most other stores couldnt even get it. Or the awesome 
aresnal of Nation 12 records etc.. as far as now.. you have to understand 
business and demographics.. San Jose is a backwaters dip shit city with a 
bunch of dick wads running around it. So they have to take lots of 
consideration when ordering on what will sell etc.. also current trends (I.E 
Happy hardcore etc) and try to order a wide array of music to suit everyones 
needs.

I personally think they do a decent job considering the area and wide 
assortment of music they sell. Yes people may say "They are No clear 
records" or They are no "Frequency-8" but you also have to understand that 
stores in the city or other areas only sell one type of genere. And in the 
southbay that would kill your business cause there isnt enough traffic to 
sustain a certain genre I don't think.. And I do alot of shopping in various 
areas (I.E Online,SF,Berkeley SJ etc) and compared to most other stores 
stock or online it isnt half bad.

So just cause they didn't have your paticular records or Genere doesn't mean 
that a store sucks.. Hell I think Sub Sonic underground sucks a Fat dick 
cause they sell a bunch of Happy hardcore crap.. Does that mean the store 
actually sucks? No im sure it is a Damn good store stocking some of the best 
in HHC. But I don't like that genre does that give me the right to condemn a 
store or it's business NO.


OK im done babbling...

          This is just to funny. I swear to God Macadio, by the way you stick up for Solid Grooves you would think you own the fuckin place. Do you have like stock options or something (kidding)? Dude get a fuckin clue Solid Grooves sucks ass. They try to stuff so many different styles and genres into that tiny store that they they don't stock a DECENT selection of any of them. I'm sorry but personally I think that store is a bad joke.

P.S. Sorry Kieth , nothing personal dude just being honest.

i know that's why i said "about 9 years ago" not exactly, ropughly. could have very easilly of been 8 considering it's almost 2003 now.
the selection was bad both times for what i was looking for. the buyer didn't have much in either. that's why i also said small selection, just like another listee mentioned as well.

co-workers and owners I will try to give an un-biased opinion.

in terms of timeline I could be off here but I dont think solid was even 
around 9 years ago.. I could be mistaken. But I use to buy records from 
Brandon when solid grooves, at that time called "Outer rythm" was run out of 
his own home with Andrian and Joe Harp. And Im thinking it was more like 7 
or 8 years ago? But at anyrate he had a solid underground selection at that 
time even selling lots of tracks from his own personal collection which is 
fucking Awesome I might add. I remember picking up lion rocks Packets of 
Peace remix.. when most other stores couldnt even get it. Or the awesome 
aresnal of Nation 12 records etc.. as far as now.. you have to understand 
business and demographics.. San Jose is a backwaters dip shit city with a 
bunch of dick wads running around it. So they have to take lots of 
consideration when ordering on what will sell etc.. also current trends (I.E 
Happy hardcore etc) and try to order a wide array of music to suit everyones 
needs.

I personally think they do a decent job considering the area and wide 
assortment of music they sell. Yes people may say "They are No clear 
records" or They are no "Frequency-8" but you also have to understand that 
stores in the city or other areas only sell one type of genere. And in the 
southbay that would kill your business cause there isnt enough traffic to 
sustain a certain genre I don't think.. And I do alot of shopping in various 
areas (I.E Online,SF,Berkeley SJ etc) and compared to most other stores 
stock or online it isnt half bad.

So just cause they didn't have your paticular records or Genere doesn't mean 
that a store sucks.. Hell I think Sub Sonic underground sucks a Fat dick 
cause they sell a bunch of Happy hardcore crap.. Does that mean the store 
actually sucks? No im sure it is a Damn good store stocking some of the best 
in HHC. But I don't like that genre does that give me the right to condemn a 
store or it's business NO.


OK im done babbling...

Amy and Rudy, great job with the party, and a big thanks to arnie and his
crew for single handedly going threw the venue and picking up every beer
bottle in sight...they are the main reason the party kept going. I had a
blast spinning, the sound in the first room could have been better, but it
worked out just great. I met a lot of great people and saw a lot of old
faces, haven't been to the crack house in about 2 yrs. I have the mix up now
for download, and stream should be up by tonight...for those who missed part
of it when we turned the volumn hella down...you can hear it fine in the
recording. Oh and you can also here all the anoucements about the cops and
smoking bomb from arnie! A big thanks to Casper and Cliff for Mcing and
being crazy all night!

go to http://www.mollymush.com/mixes.php for the mix

enjoy:)

 i figured that fish must have been getting rave
 reviews or something, which obviously brings you
 back
 today...so, what is there to do? well, we thought
 we'd
 change things up a little bit and bring you fish

 anything like that. we just want to make sure you
 get
 the quality that you apparently are seeking. so,
 thank
 you, thank you, thank you...love and lots of kisses

I'm getting ready to attack SF with my music and if anyone would like any

Subject: [sfraves] I want my beanbag back! (Paging Devotion venue owner)

Hey, I'm the guy who showed up at your party with the
World's Largest Beanbag (tm).  I sort of forgot to
pick it up as I left, and, well, I'd like it back =)

Can you email me and let me know where you guys are
located so I can come by to retrieve it?  I remember
how to get to the map point, but not how to get to the
venue.

Great party, by the way.  First event I've been to in
three loooong years, since a UVT party at the very
same venue  (tha crackhouse!) in Dec '99.  Rock on. 
Oh, and once again, thanks Arnie, you rule!

i've told people on a few occasions "you know, it's kinda rude to stand in

Subject: [sfraves] OT: East Bay Public Transportation?


Hi again,

Hope this isn't too far off-topic, but this group includes
resourceful people from all over the Bay Area.

I'm wondering what public transportation options might be
available to get from San Jose to Richmond, ideally for
commuting. Perhaps it isn't feasable, all the bus, train and
maybe Bart changes....maybe it would take all day?

Any comments on or off list appreciated. 

Thanks,

--Paul

to richmond.
one way takes about 2 hours or so.

I would say take a VTA express bus from San Jose to the Fremont BART station and then take BART to Richmond. There's a direct Fremont - Richmond line.

--0-754305905-1038870851=:73164
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

one night, little fishy, fish (this is a story, by the way)...one night, little fishy fish in pure innocence and a poke-a-dot tie went out for a little swim in the sea. it was a very cold night, so little fishy fish was cold and had the oh-my-gosh-the-shivers in the cold, icey green sea....little fishy fish was hungry too, and as you know, there are no cafes in the sea, so little fishy fish was really happy to see a smaller fishy fish waving around on the little line and hook that was being lowered into the sea by a big mean fisherman...little fishy fish took a bite out of starvation and destitution and the fisherman yanked hard on the line, and SUDDENLY, little fishy fish had a shreded mouth, but managed to escape, and the fisherman had to eat those starch and fat filled potato chips instead like he usually does. :)

yeah, BART to san jose ?  not for another 10-20 years when half of the 
penninsula residents croak.

amtrak is unfortunately the only semi-feasible way - 1hr 37min - 9 bux one 
way

Totally Idiotic Americans

By Ted Rall, AlterNet
November 27, 2002

The official seal of the Pentagon's new Total Information Awareness Office=
=20
(TIA) bears a spooky eye above a pyramid =96 you know the one, it's on the=
=20
back of the one-dollar bill =96 peering at the globe. The fact that the TIA=
=20
was quietly funded under the auspices of the bill creating the new=20
Department of Homeland Security suggests that its mission is a vital part=20
of the war on terrorism. But Europe and Asia, the two main continents of=20
the eastern hemisphere, which appear on the TIA logo, are not in fact its=20
principal targets. You are.


Rear Admiral John Poindexter, the scandal-scarred Iran-Contra figure who=20
heads the $62.9 million "data mining" operation for the Defense Department,=
=20
says that the TIA's mission is "to detect, classify and identify foreign=20
terrorists =96 and decipher their plans =96 and thereby enable the U.S. to=
 take=20
timely action to successfully preempt and defeat terrorist acts." Sounds=20
like a magnificent idea. So why do such unusual allies as the American=20
Civil Liberties Union, The New York Times, William Safire and Republican=20
senator Charles Grassley say it's dangerous?


According to the TIA's website, Poindexter's new office will "develop=20
architectures for a large-scale counter-terrorism database, for system=20
elements associated with database population, and for integrating=20
algorithms and mixed-initiative analytical tools ... invent new algorithms=
=20
for mining, combining, and [refining] ... revolutionary new models,=20
algorithms, methods, tools, and techniques for analyzing and correlating=20
information in the database to derive actionable intelligence."


In English: Total Information Awareness will use sophisticated=20
computer-modeling programs to search every database they can get their=20
hands on. They'll scan credit card receipts, bank statements, ATM=20
purchases, Web "cookies," school transcripts, medical files, property=20
deeds, magazine subscriptions, airline manifests, addresses =96 even=20
veterinary records. The TIA believes that knowing if and when Fluffy got=20
spayed =96 and whether your son stopped torturing Fluffy after you put him=
 on=20
Ritalin =96 will help the military stop terrorists before they strike.


Most of this raw data is already available to businesses trying to market=20
their products. The TIA represents the first full-scale attempt by a=20
government agency =96 the Department of Defense =96 to collect and analyze=
 that=20
information. "There has obviously been a growing problem within the private=
=20
sector over collection of information for targeted marketing," says David=20
Sobel, general counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.=20
"What's different now is the government is putting major resources into=20
getting access to privately collected data."


Critics are understandably anxious that the TIA is merely the Bush=20
Administration's latest effort to emulate the most unsavory aspects of=20
Soviet society. "If the Pentagon has its way, every American =96 from the=20
Nebraskan farmer to the Wall Street banker =96 will find themselves under=
 the=20
accusatory cyber-state of an all-powerful national security apparatus,"=20
warns Laura Murphy of the ACLU.


Is Poindexter more interested in digging up dirt on Bush's political foes=20
than fighting Islamist terrorism? Should we believe him when he says that=20
he respects the Fourth Amendment? Short of running a TIA profile on the=20
man, there's no way to know whether he's hoping to turn the United States=20
into a police state. For the sake of argument, let's assume that the TIA=20
plans to respect our privacy rights and that it won't yield to the=20
temptation to use its findings to smear political opponents.


Even if Poindexter and his domestic spying operation means well =96 and=20
that's a big if =96 the TIA is a classic case of fighting your last battle=
=20
all over again.


Like Attorney General John Ashcroft's Operation TIPS (Terrorism Information=
=20
Prevention System) =96 the Orwellian Justice Department program that asks=20
cable installers, postal workers and meter readers to turn in their=20
customers if they see any suspicious behavior =96 the TIA assumes that the=
=20
next big attack will be committed by members of Arab "sleeper cells" living=
=20
in the United States. Why do we assume this? Because that is what happened=
=20
on Sept. 11, 2001.


Presuming there will be an exact replay of Sept. 11 has led to long=20
security lines at airports and no screenings whatsoever at train stations=20
and bus depots. Which targets would you go after if you were a terrorist?


As proven by their ability to elude arrest, Osama bin Laden and his allies=
=20
are no fools. As Al Qaeda operatives plot their next attack against the=20
United States, they will exploit the weaknesses we aren't aware of or have=
=20
chosen to ignore. Another plane hijacking is unlikely, at least for the=20
foreseeable future. So are strikes carried out by illegal-immigrant=20
operatives with a fondness for strip joints living in the United States.=20
Terrorists are opportunists, not serial killers predictably utilizing=20
identical methods for each act.


Whatever you least expect: expect.


Since most of the data the TIA analyzes relates to loyal American citizens,=
=20
Total Information Awareness creates the potential for abuse of governmental=
=20
power on an unprecedented scale. Because it won't track the most likely=20
future terrorists =96 people who live in, for example, Pakistan, Egypt and=
=20
Saudi Arabia =96 it's a waste of money that furthers the illusion that our=
=20
government is protecting us.


Since Sept. 11, George W. Bush has asked us to trade our precious freedoms=
=20
for a little security. The TIA forces Americans to sacrifice privacy for=20
nothing.

Damn, I guess I better start playing all my records at 0 pitch. Since
that was the way they were made, and I don't want to play it slower or
faster.......

Please please please be creative with music happy. Do everything
different you can with what you have. Because there are too many people
out there doing the same thing......

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Devotion

now i never said at 0 pitch, but playing something @ 33 when it should be @
45 is a little different...

Actually, playing a record on 33 that is supposed to be on 45 is the
equivilent of playing the record on 45 at -26.6 pitch... Andy, how do you
think your music would sound at -26.6 pitch?

  Racine, Wisconsin: "Disorderly House" Citations First Day in Court

On Monday, December 2nd, the first 206 of 441 persons cited for
attending a November 2nd, benefit concert in Racine Wisconsin were
scheduled to enter pleas in court.  In an attempt to dissuade
individuals from challenging the $968 citations in court, Daniel Wright,
the City Attorney for Racine, offered to reduce fines to $100 for anyone
who pled "no contest."  Mr. Wright made it clear that the deal would not
apply to anyone who challenged the citations in court and subsequently
lost, they would have to pay the full $968 amount.

But only 19 people took the city attorney up on his offer and pled "no
contest."  More than 70% (147) of those who appeared in court pled "not
guilty" and demanded trials!  Another 40 individuals failed to appear in
court and were found "guilty" by default.

Last week the ACLU of Wisconsin urged the Racine City Attorney to
dismiss the disorderly house citations "in the interest of resolving
this matter quickly and avoiding a tremendous waste of public
resources."  If a similar percentage of the remaining 235 persons
scheduled to appear in court on December 9th and 16th plea "not guilty"
the City Attorney's office will face the logistical nightmare of having
to prepare and try hundreds of cases.

The City of Racine will likely be forced to hire a special prosecutor to
work full time on the disorderly house cases, police officers called to
testify in court will likely be paid overtime - unless police services
in the community are to suffer, and additional court staff may have to
be hired.  In all, the City of Racine may need to try 300+ people.

EM:DEF STRONGLY URGES ALL THOSE CITED TO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS AND
CHALLENGE THESE MERITLESS CITATIONS.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

i was just thinking, since there isn't and never will be enough jail space for all of the people who belong in there, do you think shows like dr. phil might do the trick? for example, there are tons of people on that show who have abused their children, and then their children who are in their 40's show up on the show with the parent. the adult child is in pain still and the abusive parent is suddenly just realizing that what they did wasn't the right thing, because of some isolated time that they were actually able to hear their child in adulthood...oh, i didn't know that if i hurt my child that the pain would carry on way past the moment! wow, here's to rehabilitation! how about those child development programs too? do you think if someone who has repeatedly commited criminal offense against a child watches child development programs that they will be rehabilitated and therefore, maybe it will be alright for you to stand next to that person in line at the grocery store without being subjected to some random verbal attack at some point? do you think if someone represses their hate so that for all practical appearances, via silence, that everything might be okay? like maybe you could eat breakfast with this person and not feel a hint of tension? i probably shouldn't be watching dr. phil, but i can't help but wonder about this kind of thing, because these are the people who are also on the roads driving next to the people that i care about....also, since i am now on the road, i see that you can send e-mail from you cell phone now. that is a nice option, however, i hope that no one will send e-mails while driving. pay attention to the road your on. :)

Talk about a totally over-played track.. Sandstorm is the downfall of  
mankind as we know it..

There is that whole line of "Skills Recordings" out by Tom Slik.. They  
are made for 45, but when I play them at 33 it brings out the life in  
them :)

down with that 'Sandstorm' sound!!

Subject: [sfraves] EDM and music in general (was: Devotion)

I've been at this DJ thing in various levels of involvement for almost three
years now... I've been through the "I only spin trance" phase, the "I don't
spin that trance crap, I spin jungle!" phase, I've been through the "I'm a DJ
on hiatus" phase.

Through it all, I ask this of DJ's:  What is the point of music (especially
dance music) if it doesn't make you shake your ass?  Who gives a rat's ass if
it's the "correct" speed is 33 1/3, 45, or 78?  Collage makers don't care if
the face they just cut out came from a perfume ad when they glue a military
helmet from an army ad over the top.  Who cares if it's progressive house or
progressive trance?  Wet'n'hard or just a novelty version of trance? 
Happycore, terrorcore, minimalist... It sounds like a recipe for musical
jambalaya for cryin' out loud.

If it sounds good, spin it.  If it makes you shake your ass, spin it.  If it's
your favorite digeridoo (sp?) and it sounds good in the middle of your set,
shit man, let the record play out for your digeridoo solo!  Genre, genre,
genre.  Play your sappytrance back to back with that kinda-evil sounding breaky
stuff you've got, and then explain to me why some Kraftwerk would not work? 
Sound is painting emotions that one perceives with the ears.  DJs are the
performance collage artists of the world of sound.  Why would you blow such a
wonderful gift on these notions of formula and rules that are frighteningly
reminiscent of recording industry chart strategy?

And as for you dancers... expand your damn horizons.  Seriously.  I hear
stories about happycore freaks booing non-happycore DJ's off the tables at
house parties.  C'mon guys - that's not just rude, it's narrow-minded.  There
really is as much music out there as there are emotions.  Man, you don't even
have to stick to EDM!  Try some Sinatra, some Benny Goodman, or Dave Brubeck. 
Shed your fear of disco and kazaa yourself some songs, just so you know what
people your age were listening to in the 70's.  Look up "Northern Soul" on the
web and get a taste of UK Raving's great great grand-daddy.

I'm by FAR not the greatest DJ in the bay area, and let's not even talk about
beyond that.  But I take my records with me, I play 'em, and I dance to 'em. 
And folks seem to like it.  And if they don't, they go to another room.  I
still wreck on a somewhat regular basis, but DJing isn't all about
beatmatching.  It's about your collage.  It's about the whole thing when it's
said and done.  That said, may I quote the great and wise Obi-Wan Kenobi: "Let
go, Luke!  Trust your feelings!"

Oh... and PLAY IT LOUD!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: webcams and posting nude photos [was RE: [sfraves] Why sooooo sloooooow??]

Hmmm, I have something off-topic that is somewhat interesting. I visited an
old friend over the holidays, and he is new to the computer scene, having
just bought a PC about 4 weeks ago. Now, he is totally depraved and hooked
on the latest and greatest time-waster, web cams and dirty pictures.

Apparently, there are several web sites where you can post pictures of
yourself (live or still) and everyone else can see you. Moreover, you can
share pictures through email. Fun, fun, fun--but everyone lies like hell.

He actually got an old nude photo (not of himself)--just of a hunky guy, and
aimed his web cam towards the shot. Now he gets hundreds of emails every day
from guys all over the globe, talking about how "hot" he is and wanting more
pictures.

All I could think of this entire aspect of the Internet was: how perverted.
Although, I have not minded the few photos that he has forwarded to me! It
is just that I cannot help but think about how saturated we are with visual
imagery, versus real life.

I bet that these guys would not do such a thing if there were no Internet
anonymity. (No one knows who you are). Well, actually, some of the dudes
were bold enough to include a face shot! I guess they just want to show it
all. Who knows what they want. My friend says that many of these peeps are
just straight guys getting their thrills. He said that once, he was watching
a live web cast where a guy was "getting off" (while IMing/chatting) and the
dude thought that he was a girl! (Then my friend said his name, whereupon
the other guy immediately terminated the Internet connection). Man, this is
just a crazy world of peeping toms.

Well, that is my take on off-topic threads today.

Greg

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Devotion

Back before I had any breakbeat tracks I would play my trance 45's 
on 33 RPM to teach myself how to scratch. Much easier to learn at 
that speed. Sandstorm was one of those records :-p
I think it sounds better on 33 than 45!

Talk about a totally over-played track.. Sandstorm is the downfall of  
mankind as we know it..

There is that whole line of "Skills Recordings" out by Tom Slik.. They  
are made for 45, but when I play them at 33 it brings out the life in  
them :)

down with that 'Sandstorm' sound!!

Amen. 

The way I see it, and for whatever that's worth, the
most innovative people and artists are the ones we
respect, the ones that all of the other people
emulate.  What would this scene be like without
pioneers like Kraftwerk, Underworld or even 808 State?
 Why not play with the genre? Who likes big white
lines anyway? Record Companies and glossy magazines
(ecstacy pop?) who can market big divides! Isn't
change the only way the scene will survive without
being co-opted? If not, we will hear the same 'four on
the floor' or the same 303 bassline over and over and
over again in those damn car commercials. Take the
chance of being booed. If it happens, ah well, genius
is never recognized immediately. 

And why hasn't someone made a Jungle/D&B remix of Take
Five by The Dave Brubeck Quartet?  It's the right
rhythm for it...up the tempo and damn...

Still?? I need a job that affords me that luxury! Monday came crashing in
and spanked me all the way to the office. Actually it wasn't that bad given
that we had to leave the office for 2.5 hours for a fire inspection.

I think everyone is just busy, bored with sfr, or studying for finals.
Perhaps all three and then some...

probably really fucking cool with some hip hop beats mixed over it.  Go 
listen to a ztrip album.  do you really think he's playing metallica at the 
standard speed to mix it with two other tracks?

be creative.  make music where there is none.

Ya...I'm gonna' be so 21st century and get with the tap dancin' 'n 
things.  Or is it swing?  Nope.  God, I don't know what fashion to turn my 
soul over too.  Eighties?  I hear disco is back.  Lordy, staying on top of 
things is so exhausting.  Think I'll be unfashionable this century:)  Rave 
on....

Subject: [sfraves] EDM : tempo (and we don't mean Fords !)

slow it down, speed it up, do what you want.

but the real deal is slowing down *v o c a l s*

it can extenuate subtleties that are almost entirely lost at real-time...   
a perfect example is Puretone's Addicted To Bass... even if it's not your 
bag, compare the orig to the Different Gear mix and you'll see what i mean.  
it's not a very interesting remix to say the least (except maybe for the 
awesome bassdrops at the end) but the slow down turns an already compelling 
voice into a raw sultry calling with sibilance that just haunts you to the 
bone.  yeah, recording female vocals at +5-15% then tempo them down that 
much for the final... *fans himself*

Has anyone ever slowed down daft punk's Homework album?  I re-burned a slow 
copy to CD it's so fucking cool.  I can't take complete credit tho, my homey 
rybones first started it.

Subject: [sfraves] SFLNC Bumper Stickers

One of the best ways to show Bay Area politicians that there are a heckova 
lotta dancers in this city that care about club closings, curfews, permits, 
etc. - would be if the San Francisco Late Night Coalition made bumper 
stickers, and made them available at their booth at clubs and raves.  I 
actually took a regular SFLNC sticker and put it on my car, till it fell 
off... just an idea.

SFLNC did make *Dancing Is Not A Crime* bumper stickers. They were black
with a rainbow gradient in the writing. I remember a girl I know making them
into a bra at a party. Pretty funny.

Anyone in SFR land a lawyer? I am in desperate need to ask a few
family/divorce law questions of one and can't afford to actually make an
appointment with one. If anyone is practicing law or is a law student up on
such topics would I be able to ask you a couple questions?

Much gratitude if anyone can help!

Jennifer

Isn't hardcore a genre that started out as classic 33 rpm rave records
being played at 45?

Who cares what it's supposed to be spun at if it sounds good?

If it's a breaks track, but at happycore/hardcore speed is it not a breaks
track? This is where genre classification falls apart. I was there and
remember hearing breakneck speedbreaks that were bouncy as hell. Happycore,
yes. Breakbeats, yes. Perspective makes all the difference. I always find it
cool when I hear a remix of a track done in another genre (assuming it's
done well and has a good spin on the original). Yes a *core label released
this track, but if Happy can spin it at ~75% of it's original speed and make
it work, well, that's great because it's different. Much in the way that
pitching up Metallica to 170bpm is amusing and fun to mix in for a moment.

keep it fun and different!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Devotion

But if it's spun upside down using the duct tape trick and flipping the
cartridge is it still the same genre? Aight I'll shut up now. I feel like
I've ignored the list here and focused on VW's again. Nothing like
rebuilding a Corrado from the ground up! Who had the yellow G60 at Devotion?
Clean exterior...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SFLNC Bumper Stickers

Yeah exactly!!! : )

Remember the "I have a dog and I vote"    bumper stickers.


When you and I speak up they wont bully us anymore.

**Curfews**club closures** fucked up permitting process**
that is all an infringement on the pursuit of MY LIBERTY.


Don't make me exercise my rights, bitch.


Oops, pardon the anger.


This is the main issue. Property owner's rights are paramount within the
present political values system.

If we as a community remain silent and inactive, we will forever be clubbed
to death, (with property owners rights).

I am willing to work together to make this world livable for us all.
And I am truly sorry for the people  who bought condos right next to a
thriving club district.

But I am not going to let these slightly ignorant people throttle the very
life out of our town.
Can I define ignorance as not knowing the damage that they do?


Okay, sorry, decaf, please. (Hey wait a minute I don't need to apologize!)

One of the best ways to show Bay Area politicians that there are a heckova
lotta dancers in this city that care about club closings, curfews, permits,
etc. - would be if the San Francisco Late Night Coalition made bumper
stickers, and made them available at their booth at clubs and raves.  I
actually took a regular SFLNC sticker and put it on my car, till it fell
off... just an idea.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SFLNC Bumper Stickers

I think the best way to deal with all of this curfew shit is to just stop 
partying.  Sit at home, do nothing, pick your ass, check out those nude 
sites on the net so you can waste more time doing nothing...then all the 
politicians/cops/catholic priests will wonder....
"remember those days when all we did was worry about kids trying to have fun 
rather than focus on all the important issues?  Like unemployment, health 
insurance to those who can't afford it...ya know?  what happenned to those 
people who danced for fun?"
Then we could pop back out of nowhere, like a deer on a dark mountain road 
and we could dance like we never danced before.

but then they would notice us more than before and it would be back to 
square one again...fuck

check out my new nudie site  www.myassgrowswhennobodygoesdancing.fucked
Hot new facial pics of my ass getting bigger by the second! (.)
Sorry, I work way too much.
Danny

Or we can spend more time trying to unite people and getting them all 
"organized" over the internet to make bumper stickers that say,
"Live life to the fullest,
beat off and dance at the same time"

Repo Steve

1) This list is beyond the scope of Karina Powers

     reply: I do know that Karina post on SFR and often read messages on
SFR. The scope of your mind is about the size of a dime.

1a) Email or call *her* - not the list.

      reply: I have emailed her with no progress in getting my jacket back.
I do not have her phone number. So if any of you have her number, please
call her.

2) Include more then one line in your post.

    reply:  If you learned to count there are actually 4 lines of text in my
last post.

3) If you set it free, and it dosen't come back to you, it
wasn't meant to be.

     reply: What kind of bullshit statement is this regarding material
property? Yes it might be a good quote for those who are in love but we are
talking about a material object here. If you left something valuable like a
wedding ring at my house , would you try to get it back? If that is the
case, please come leave valuables in my car.

     I am unemployed currently and that is my only jacket that I wear
everyday. I cannot afford to buy another one with similiar thermal
properties.

Steve

I'm gonna be there the weekend of the 14th and want some ideas of what
to check out.  I'm not sure there is the equivalent of sfraves for there
so if anyone knows the deal on parties there, hook me up!   Suggestions
on good clubs will be great too.  I know our Miguel Migs will be up there
that weekend, but I don't feel like heading to an ultra packed event.

thanks

You can find lots of deep voiced women on Polk street...

I know what you mean though, especially when you have tracks with women
with really high voices... I used to play Revenge of the Number by
Portishead in my ambient sets a bit, always blunted the fuck out at like
-6 or -8 on the pitch slider.

there is a sound on the other side of this wall,
a bird is singing on the other side of this glass.
footsteps, concealed.
silence is preserving a voice.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: A kinda morbid, but interesting, thought for the day

What do you think people will say about you at your funeral?

Would they say something that would truly reflect the way you wanted to
live your life? Are you living your life the way you want to? 

Just a little brain candy for the day... No replies are necessary, but
definitely welcome.

For me: The best I can hope for right now is the wonderful comments:
"Well, life around her was never boring" or "Dude, remember the parties
she threw?" LOL!!

Have a great day everyone!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] EDM and music in general (was: Devotion)

> Through it all, I ask this of DJ's:  What is the
> point of music (especially
> dance music) if it doesn't make you shake your ass?

as a dj-in-training (slowly but surely), and as an
ardent music-lover of many different genres, i'd like
to argue that there is so much more value to music
than just moving people to dance.

there are a number of songs that i really enjoy just
listening to, i call them my "will-to-live" songs.
some of them are great dance music but nonetheless i
also enjoy lying in my room with the lights out and
the headphones on, feeling a connection with the
artists and the inspiration that moved someone to
create those songs.  

in fact, call me a big corny cheesehead because i am,
but some songs make me want to sit still and just
listen.  and when i go to a party and i get to hear
those songs played on a big booming system, all the
better.  nothing against dancing, i love to dance as
well but dancing to music is such a different
experience for me, i tend to alternate between dancing
phases and listening phases depending on my mood.
 
> Who gives a rat's ass if
> it's the "correct" speed is 33 1/3, 45, or 78? 

as someone who also loves to study and discuss
philosophy and psychology, i often get told by my
friends, "who cares what you call it, it is what it
is!  why do you need to talk about all this shit, why
not just go out and live your life, JUST DO IT instead
of wasting all these words and moments trying to
dissect and analyze and verbalize etc etc etc??"

the truth is, i enjoy talking about the bits and
pieces, that is me living my life and loving it just
as much anyone else going out and just doing what
other people are talking about.

while learning to spin, i've gotten lots of technical
pointers from friends, that take a lot of the effort
out of trying to "feel" your way around to the right
speeds.  intuition is an important factor, surely, but
not everyone knows how to be intuitive (i most
certainly didn't at first), and skills that are
learned and practiced, using logic, memory, and reason
are as equally invaluable as intuition.  

i think you make many excellent points, graham, which
i am not trying to overlook - most importantly, to me,
that guidelines are helpful, especially for relative
newcomers to the dj arena like myself, but it is not
all there is to know.  "let go" is good advice, to
that i would add "know when."  

;)sooz

Subject: [sfraves] This is Not a Rave by Tara MacCall

hey West Coast peeps!

stocking stuffer for ravers  :)

i am falling in love with this book for the intelligence, research, pas=
sion
and love that clearly went into it, and the photography.

large square paperback (8.5" x 8.5"), $19.95

it has a bit of a canadian spin (there needs to be some homegrown ameri=
can
books written about our scene, yo! :), but rave is universal in experie=
nce
and this is closer to home than "generation ecstasy" and "altered state=
."

big up to Tara MacCall.  nice job!

respectfully,
mary  :)

press release below:

THIS IS NOT A RAVE
IN THE SHADOW OF A SUBCULTURE
Tara McCall

The word "rave" instantly conjures a multitude of images, attitudes and=

reactions. It is a scene that is ripe with dichotomies: beautiful, utop=
ian
moments that exist in tandem with accusations of underworld criminal
activity. Raves have been accused by some of enticing society's youth t=
o
mass-scale "crack houses," with the drug ecstasy as the Pied Piper of t=
he
decade. Others have praised this dance playground as a creative space f=
or
youth identity and exploration.

Raves are the modern party scene with ideal locales ranging from tents =
to
empty, large warehouses decorated with swirling lights and fluorescent
paint. These are the places where teenagers and young adults come to un=
wind
and release all of their pent-up energy in wild dancing, swaying and
jumping to the feeling that the power of the music gives them.  Because=
 of
the unique role they play in the lives of young partygoers, rave cultur=
e is
a worldwide phenomenon of unprecedented mass-appeal.  Its catalyst drug=
,
MDMA/Ecstasy, its fashion of defiant adolescence, and its unofficial cr=
edo
of Peace, Love, Unity and Respect are typical features of the atmospher=
e at
raves. In This is Not A Rave, Tara McCall explores raves from their ear=
ly
underground days in places like Ibiza and London, to the emergence of
commercial mega-raves that now attract tens of thousands of revelers in=

every corner of the globe and illuminates the wild fashion, drugs, and
hypnotic music and most importantly, she discusses the hedonistic dance=
 of
a subculture that is now being driven back to the underground.

The voices of hundreds of young dancers who tell their own stories
supplements McCall's personal tour of rave culture as well as exclusive=

interviews with well-known DJs and producers like Juan Atkins, David
Mancuso, Larry Heard, and a Guy Called Gerald. Challenging and
entertaining, This Is Not a Rave makes room for the many voices of this=

global phenomenon.

Tara McCall wrote her masters thesis on rave culture at McGill Universi=
ty.
She has taught dance for several years and now works in television.  Sh=
e
lives in Toronto.

Subject: [sfraves] my neulight blazed!

So there I was driving down once again to sf on a friday evening.
All excited ,all charged up for the weekend once again!
there was virtually no traffic at all just because it was the holiday
weekend. I was very keen and excited about this because it was supposed to 
have some really fine techno and then psy trance for the rest of the 
evening!
Oh my gosh, what more could I ask for:)
I got to the map point and then took the shuttle from over there.
While on the shuttle, I got to talk with the drivers, and then while
introducing themselves, one of them goes, I'm Andy. And I say, the same
Andy as in the one playing there later on. He smiles & says yeah!
Him & Megan were very nice, we had a fine but short conversation till they 
dropped us off. They never really got to be there for most part of the night 
since they were in charge of the shuttle.
It seemed to be like some office complex where we went into. It seemed
very posh & I was quite impressed that they had managed to find something 
like that. It opened out into a huge hall, it seemed like a warehouse but 
not quite like it , only better. A better version of one:)
And then, the restrooms were sooo nice too.
There were quite a few people there already. But as expected, every single 
one of them was sitting down on the couches and chairs spread out all around 
the periphery of the hall. The decorations consisted of some drawings pinned 
on the walls all around and then there was a giant screen off to the left 
side where they had the usual graphics that were supposed to add to a raving 
atmosphere heh heh.
I went and sat down on one of the couches to soak in the whole ambience
before I started off my night. This short haired blonde comes to sit by me & 
immediately starts speaking to me. Later on, I ask her name, its Susan.
And I did not connect it to anyone either. Till she posted about the party 
the next day. Another fellow sfraver! :)
Mike Liu also came over to me & we started talking. Maybe he recognized me 
from the couple of emails I had sent him. He was also very friendly and he 
pointed out the various people who would be spinning later on in the evening 
and introduced me to some of them.
And after dilly dallying for a few minutes, I decided to get up and start 
dancing on the wide empty floor. I went right up there to the front of the 
decks & then I realised something. Ah ha, this time I did buy some earplugs, 
I had them in the bag but never thought of putting those on.
Chris the Neoangelic had told me about those. I knew I would not get a
piar in time if I tried to get it online. So I tried my luck at a Tower
record store. And voila, they did have some, under the brand name of
Hearos. It seemed the same as the etymotic earplugs that I had seen
online. These are rated at 12 db noise reduction and are supposed to
attenuate equally across the entire frequenct spectrum more or less.
Yeah, they did seem to work pretty good. But then, I do this other weird
thing, if I inhale in suddenly & sharply, I always manage to sort of close 
my ears to a certain extent. And then I can make them pop if I exhale fast. 
I'm sure some people know exactly what I am talking about.
So anyway, combining both this & the earplugs, for the first time in my
raving life, my ears felt fine at the end of the night!
I really, highly recommend to everyone to get a pair, because even if you 
dont feel it right now, that damage is taking place, & the scary part is 
,that process is kind of irreversible.
Back to the rave,  I went up to the decks, asked the guy who was spinning, 
who are you. He was nonplussed and then I clarified, like what name do you 
play under. He was Atum, one of the thump radio dj's; several of whom would 
be playing for the night.
Yes, the cycle repeats itself, I stood there, slowly getting into my
groove and then I broke out with my trademark crazy legs heh heh.
He was spinning some fine psytrance! For a while, there was just another
dude who came up & started dancing a little bit after I started. And then, 
people eventually started getting up from their (warm?) couches and came 
over to the floor too. Not a big crowd at all, but I loved it. The few 
people that were indeed dancing, they were so much enjoying themselves.
A good vibe existed! And there I was, wondering earlier, like uh oh is
this going to be like my prvious Sac experiences?  My fears were pretty
much assuaged.
The clock hands crept up to half before the witching hour, and I was
waiting so anxiously for Chris Jackson. I had such an INCREDIBLE time when 
he spun for an hour. I wanted him to go on for way more than that!
He was his usual cool self, totally concentrating on spinning his music.
But I'm sure from the corner of his eyes, he was watching everything else 
around him. Fine, wicked, dark, complex strains of melodies flowed and I was 
in rave heaven. He also got into this breaks section for part of the mix and 
that was awesome too. That was when, he was kind of grooving away too:) Too 
bad, very few people were up and dancing. They didnt know what they were 
missing out on or perhaps they were so overwhelmed by the beautifulness that 
they forgot to get up heh heh. whatever it was, I danced my butt off. I was 
spinning round and round, contorting my body into crazy angles and just 
being so wild in general. And I could not help yelling out now & then during 
the downtempo parts to show how much I was loving it. Though, I did not yell 
out full blast. For some strange reason, I was wondering if that might be 
too loud (because I could not tell the volume since I had earplugs) Quite 
funny heh heh.
I was so exhausted with the frenzy that was all Chris J's fault that I had 
to take a breather. I went over & flopped down on the couch, too bad I could 
not keep up my frenzy, because Dutch was spinning some neat psytrance too!  
Sometimes I wish, I had a piar of reserve legs, which I could put on & 
continue on without a break:)
While sitting there, I spied a pair of glowing green pants with a familiar 
design on it. It sparked off something in my brain & then I knew it was 
neoangelic Chris!! I was so pleased to see him, I had to get up & drag my 
tired butt over to say hi. He wondered when Chris Jackson was coming on, I 
said he had already missed him. Too bad, he said he was driving with someone 
who drove like a grandma hahahaha. I wonder if he had known when Chris J 
spinning, if he would have gone out of control & taken over the reins ahem 
wheels heh heh.
I pretty much stayed on the couch for most of his set, there was this guy 
roaming around , checking up on people to make sure that no one was
smoking.  No offense to any smokers but yes, the smoke kind of bothers me 
when I am dancing in there. I mean its alright to do their thing, but they 
could always do it in a seperate lounge or something, and come back inside 
to dance some more. That guy was really taking his task seriously, when I 
happened to glance at him. He would be shinning the light now & then, 
wherever he thought he should. Too cool! I saw him on my way out, and by the 
time I was out, I realised I should have stopped & lauded him on his 
efforts:)
I got over some my exhaustion and then, I went back on to the floor to
dance to the last few minutes of that set.  There were actually way more
people than the last hour. Obviously they must be very familiar with that 
strain of electronica or the thump radio parties. I really, really hope 
techno becomes a big & viable part of the scene. I dont see why that wont 
happen. Its only a matter of time...
Mike was trying to decide when he should have Mr Steve Ronan spin. He
wanted as many people to see him, hance the reasoning. Steve came on after 
all, at half past one.  Yeah, he was the other big part of the night that I 
had been looking forward too!!!
He is a short bloke & he looked like he had stayed up too long & had been 
drinking too much coffee heh heh.
He lived up to his reputation too(whatever that be, I have no idea:) I
just loved the music so much. He did not man the turntables, instead
choosing to bypass that with cd's. At the end of the night, he said he was 
just feeling a wee bit lazy heh heh.
People were falling away like flies as his set and the night went on.
Maybe a handful of us were dancing away and we were going strong.
During the set, there was this tall, thin girl with tiny pigtails whirling 
in front of the decks in a swoop and dancing away wildly & then swirling out 
of sight. Yeh, she had the groove alright!!! Naturally, I talked to her, 
she's Franceska?  And then, there was this other curly haired brunette 
dancing oh so smoothly. I would almost say that she was doing the Liquid, 
but it was quite close. I was like, wow, I want to learn how to do that! She 
was Nicole.
And then Chris had said he would come right to the very front to dance
when Steve spun. He did try alright, but only for a while. He had
unfortunately not brought his ear plugs along. So he stayed a fair
distance for the rest of the evening. Though for the instances when we
danced around in proximity, I had fun. I always have fun, he goes into all 
kinds of exotic moves, and I imitate that. And then, I do something & he 
follows. Its too cool kicking it with him! Ooh he told me about the rave 
store where he bought his pants, I need to ask him again because maybe some 
time I might be able to afford getting something fancy like that. I like 
dressing up when going dancing!
This gorgeous ravishing readhead was taking pictures left & right, I went up 
to ask her if it was for some website, & she says sfraves. She said her name 
is Karina, and then I recognized her from that.
All of Steve Ronan's set was a delight, I dont know how I managed to keep 
dancing all the time, but how could I resist!  He must have stopped at maybe 
a little bit after 3. I thought, Mike and Andy would come on next.
But Atum came on again, he was spinning so good that Mike let him come on 
again. I groaned to Mike, I thought you were coming on next. And he's
teasing me saying that if he did, the rest of the people left in the room 
would flee heh heh. He did come on for a very few minutes, Andy did not at 
all. I guess I will have to wait till the next time.
It all ended at 4 (because they could not get the venue for later than
that time)  I still hung around for maybe another half an hour.
I had fun speaking with Steve some more. He said that he had played in
Bombay when I said where I was from.
I did not want to leave even though it was over. I still wanted to be
around them. Hang around & talk with them forever. Though I knew every
single person in there just like that night, they were all so nice, it
seemed like I had known them forever.  Sigh, I am getting sentimental.
I ws about to go off to the restroom and Steve asked, you leaving?
I smiled and said no, I'm coming back. And I said, I'm going to tell you
when I go.
And yeah, I came back, I talked with them even more. Its kind of a blur
about exactly what we talked about. But I will remember the feeling, it
was so wonderful. It was with an ache in my heart that I realised that it 
was finally time to go home. I shook his hand, said goodbye and started 
walking away. And when I reached the entrance, I knew I had to do this...I 
went back, I said i want a picture with all of you. And so, there we were 
sitting all in a bunch and smiling away. Me in the middle, surrounded by 
Steve, Dutch, Atum and Mike who was crouching above my head to be in the 
pic. Click!!! went the camera and yet another moment was captured on print 
locking up an entire chain of memories that shall be triggered time after 
time when I look at it.
And then, I took the shuttle back to my car, I was the last one. Megan was 
saying she thought everyone had already left. While she was driving me back, 
we were talking about our dreams of travelling all over the world.

Subject: [sfraves] my Devotion  (aka  discovering hardcore)

Saturday evening crept up & started passing by, I tried calling the info 
line for Midnight recess and there was nothing at all. I actually pulled 
over & thought for a few minutes before getting on the
freeway once again. OH boy, what a dilemna.
And then I still did not sense anything concrete. the next best thing was to 
be rational & choose what was certain:) I mean there would be hardcore 
there, but I saw it this way..maybe it was time for me to give it a try:)
And besides I could check out Molly Mush.
And then I flew away to Oakland, I actually got lost trying to find
Skills! I really & truly got lost due to some stupid block numbering. down 
that street(Telegraph ave) So I went the wrong way and then it was almost 9. 
Like 10 minutes to 9. And I was literally crying, I mean I wanted to go, I 
did not want to be stranded & go to some stupid club in the city!
In sheer desperation, I kind of stopped every couple of blocks & asked
every person I encountered about Skills! See I did not have their phone
number either, silly me.
And then, I saw this internet cafe, I thought maybe I could try there.
The girl managing the store was so nice! She said, yes I could use her
account & look for it. My fingers flew over the keyboard....and the
strange thing was that Skills does not have a website with a phone
number! 5 minutes to 9 & ticking....(the shop supposedly closed at 9)
And finally, where do I find a number, in one of lines listed in a hit
result on some random website which had a comment on Skills!
Relieved, I rushed over to her, again she was so awesome. She let me use
the phone and I dialed the digits. The clock said 9, and I was relieved
when I heard someone pick up. I said everything about me & they gave me
directions, & said they would wait for me. Putting down the phone, I was
so relieved, I had a huge sigh of relief and there was a big big smile on my 
face. If it werent for the counter behind which that girl was, I would have 
given her a big hug. So all I said was thank you so much & skipped out of 
the cafe.
They gave me my ticket, & then there was this other guy there, he was up
here for Thanksgiving & was trying to figure on what party to go for.
The Skills guy said there was exactly one more ticket left(for Devotion)
if he wanted it. He started thinking hard, & then he says but how do I get 
there. Automatically it came from me, sure I can take you there & then drop 
you off for your greyhound bus.
He made up his mind & got the very last ticket. There was even more
confusion to follow. When we called for directions from his cell, we
could barely decipher it. The girl was speaking way too fast for us to
pick it up. And then, he had this idea of going over to a coffee shop he
had been to around the uc berkeley campus. His reasoning was that there
were plenty of people there and someone should know! He was going to make 
someone listen to the directions and then ask them to help us heh heh.
And then, we get a hold of one of the guys managing the shop. He is all
serious & then he goes gets someone else. So he kind of understands &
tells us how to go about the first half.
Truthfully, when I listened to it again (for a few times) it did become
clear to me. I dont know who was recording on that, but they better not
carry the theme of a hardcore party too far, making the directions stick
to that speed is not nice:):)
Yay, we finally got there, only to find that this was a map point. And
there were tons of people already waiting to be shuttled. People was
desperately even looking for tix but there were none to be had.
We somehow could sneak past the whole line, because when they called for
people to start getting in the back of one truck. No one started, & then
the girl in there looked at me & motioned us to go ahead. Haha , as we
were getting in, she says if they dont start getting in, its their fault.
We had to lie down low to avoid being seen since there like 8? people in
the back. Oooh, that was so exciting. I was day dreaming that hopefully we 
might see some action as in a cop chasing us. I am just kidding.
We arrived at the venue and we were quickly ushered inside.
Oh yeah, it was a proper warehouse. There were tons of people, the
lightening was quite garish. There had been a feeble attempt at
decorations. I dont mean in a bad way, it just added to how the ambience
in there was. Yep, happy hardcore was ripping out of the speakers in that 
main room. I did not see a lot of people dancing. Almost all of them were 
standing around & hanging out. I went on to the other room, I figured this 
was the trance/house room. It was even more crowded. Was it Majere spinning 
when I got in? We must have got there like a little bit before 11. I wanted 
to know who was playing when, but had little luck in finding that out.
Though I did get to know about some of the sets I really wanted
to see. Miss Molly Mush was going to come on an hour or so later on.
Yeah, I knew I had to check her out. Her mixing and of course her:)
Frankly I have never been to any party which did have hardcore. This was
my first time, I did not know how it would go. I really thought it was not 
meant for me. But anyway I wanted to try it out.
I danced for a while in the house room, I got on the elevated space at the 
back, to my delight I found the floor was wooden and it was truly springy.
Oh joy! this was the best floor I had been to. It had the right amount of 
the tiniest spring which was good for jumping around.
I had a good time dancing away on that platform till I somehow knew it was 
time to go to the other room.
I was really excited & agog with curiousity about my first exposure to
hardcore. I slowly edged my way through the crowd(a very still standing
crowd) to kind of in the front as someone before Molly was finishing up
his set.  I have been to her website but did not care to glance much at
pics so I did not recognize her till she stepped up.
Everyone around me erupted in a cheer, I joined in. And then the music
started flowing, the beats started building up, faster & faster. And wow, I 
was actually dancing to it. Moving in time to the beat, equally fast. I had 
always, always thought for long about how it would be insane to keep up with 
that tempo. But this was wonderful, my body was just doing it automatically. 
I did not really have to make too much effort.
So there I was, my feet not doing much(they would wear out so fast
otherwise!) while from the waist up, I was a mini tornado. Twisting &
turning & writhing & gyrating. My brain was overflowing with the lovely
music and I was smiling. And at this point, I had an awesome realisation.
Yes!! I indeed do like happy hardcore, I fell in love with yet another
style of electronika:):)!!! The music spun on, a couple of guys were mcing 
while Molly spun. Oh yeah, they were so totally enthusiastic and trying to 
urge the crowd on to some serious dancing. Too bad, still most of them were 
just standing there. A handful of us were indeed dancing though, that was 
cool. I found to my wonder, that I could just keep going, I mean keep 
dancing at that tempo for as long as I wanted. How fun! One of them(Cliff) , 
pointed at me and something about how I was dancing so much and that I was 
hardcore. Something like that. I was pleased.  Yep I was the dude dancing 
out there, in my "leave no trace" ethics dark green t shirt.
The cops came(they always have to huh) and for a few minutes the music was 
turned down as they announced that they would shut the whole thing down at 
1! And then, they said they would let it go on if everyone disposed their 
drinks, smokes,etc.  How cool, I mean I did not have to deal with that, but 
atleast getting rid of the smoke in the air, I would like that(not that I 
have anything against those people, its just their own thing!)
A collective roar went up from the crowd as the music started thumping &
shaking the room once again!  Oh yeah I did forget my earplugs that night( 
how very dumb! I forgot to take em in a hurry)
I loved Molly's set, it was too bad it was over quite soon. I hope I get a 
chance to see her again sometime ! And there's another thing, the way I was 
located, when she had her head slightly bent down while mixing.
I thought it was cool, the way I could not see her eyes, but only her
eyelids and eyebrow. I aint being weird, that pose just struck me:)
I cheered as she got done, I was going to go up say hi, but she
apparently was in a hurry and so I did not go up as she headed out.
But anyway, thanks to her, I am into happy hardcore!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That I think was the best part of my night, the highest note.
I left the room feeling so high. I went back to the other room and stayed 
there for the rest of the night. I did want to see Valerie Sparks, I dont 
think she did come?
Back on the springy floor, I was jumping around, when this guy comes up to 
me. I did not place him at first though he seemd familiar. It was Dustin 
from my very first rave, ETA Neo Tokyo 3000!! It was grand to see him.
He had this kind of a turban hat on heh heh.  One of the tnings that came up 
as we talked...I happened to ask if he knew who was spinning right then. And 
he says, "I dont know, I am not here to see someone specific spin, if I like 
the music, I just dance. I can dance to this music anywhere, but raves are 
special because its only there that I can
experience the exact kind of atmosphere which is so perfect for listening 
and dancing to that music."
Maybe not his exact words, but that's what I kind of remember. I said how 
true....how can I not keep going back; where else could I ever find the vibe 
that existed there. And the whole ambience or aura or atmosphere.
Only to be found at raves like this!!!:) And I guess that's why I keep
coming back time after time, from far, far away.
My life would definitely have a void if I stopped or if I cant go anymore.
So, there was this girl dressed up like a cheerleader? I am bad at
recognizing costumes. The people who were there will know what I mean, the 
redhead in a white shirt & blue tie, a teeny weeny red skirt & sexy laced 
white stockings. She was part of the crew & oh yeah , she was so cheerful & 
playing her role to the hilt & loving every moment of it. She would flit 
around from room to room, always smiling always yelling out , shaking her 
lil butt & then flitting to another corner:) I didnt even ask her name heh 
heh.
Yeah, I met more awesome people, again I'm bad with names so dont remember 
too much. There was this guy who maybe recognized me from my postings & he 
says, are you crazy legs?  I said yeah, & he laughs & says, I cant believe 
it, I met Crazy legs. He kept going on with that for a few minutes. Neither 
sarcastically either, that was nice & funny heh heh. Oh yeah, if he gets 
this, he better email me back because we were talking about possible 
software jobs in Berkeley. Hey, write me asap!!
And from him, I came to know this was called the crackhouse.  He had
bought a large couch kind of thing. He said he always brought something or 
the other with him every time he went raving & left it behind.
I started tiring out as the night wore on, though I had to keep dancing
because I was also waiting to hear the hard house spun by Denise.
That was a fine set, she was mxing along with someone else. I dont know
his name but he was good too. I really did try to dance hard, I guess
somehow I carried on for that entire hour. Arrrgh, I really wanted to
dance, but my body could not keep up the frenzy. I crashed down at the end 
of that set, it was 3 in the morning.
The crowd was thinning out, & I decided to take off. I knew I could not go 
on anymore! I crashed in the car as usual, snuggling beneath my sleeping 
bag. Then, I heard a knock on the window, it was Jeremy, he was back too.
There was a house party going on somewhere in So SF . I said let me sleep & 
maybe I will be up for driving. Never happened heh heh, I could not get up 
till like 6 or so.
I dropped him off at the bus station and then headed over to The End up.
Once again I had fun dancing in there, this time getting worn out even
quicker at maybe 2 in the afternoon.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SFLNC Bumper Stickers

Ya know, this thread brings back some memories...

When I first got involved with DanceSafe, one of the things we were thinking of
at the time was getting volunteers certified to register people to vote (like
they do on those clipboards at rallys and such), and actually having voter
registration at the booths.  Eventually, IIRC, tho we determined that doing so
would be too political of an action, and therefore jeopardise our 501(c)3
status.

Sometimes, tho, I've toyed with the idea of spinning off a seperate group
myself to so so.  After all, wouldn't it have been nifty if all 10K 18+ ravers
at the last Skills party had walked out of there registered to vote?  I know in
a city of 700K, 10K is only a small blip.  But every little bit would help, eh?

And, of course, a part of that would be to hand out stickers that say something
like: "I'm a raver, and I VOTE!".

The optimisic part of me really does want to believe that that would put a bit
of the fear of god into the pigs.

Anyway, my main contribution to the discussion on the topic at DanceSafe was a
hold back from my punk rock days and to suggest thet we use the sticker guy:

http://www.stickerguy.com/menu.html

I think better than half the punk rock bands in the US get their stickers
through him.  Of the cliche: "Fast, good, cheap; pick two", he is good and
cheap.  He's just a bit slow.  Good people too... it's a small, independant
company, not beholden to the big corperate players.  And they really do top
notch work.  And they even donate a fair bit of their profits to charity:

http://www.stickerguy.com/charities.htm

(Is it obvious yet that I think pretty highly of these guys?  But wait...)

What else is nifty, is that in addition to your standard black, white, and red
vinyl stickers; they also have metallic foil backgrounds, GLITTER backgrounds,
brushed chrome, prismatic, and even GLOW IN THE DARK vinyl!  All of these are
the high-quality stuff that could be used for bumper stickers!

Would it not be nifty to have a GLOW IN THE DARK "voting raver" or SFLNC bumper
sticker???


cya,
john

I concur - I've dealt with stickerguy a number of times, and their work is
the SHIT for what you pay. High quality silkscreened artwork on vinyl, and
stupid-cheap if you want black & white in a predetermined size.

Ahhhh, this reminds me...
of a party called shuffle, 
the lineup downstairs included Re-ach and Bre-ad
(WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?!)...

Re-ach is insane and mixed Pantera in with oldskool
darkstep. What a nutter, it was as good as mixing in
classical with jungle. 

memories, memories, *sigh*

Subject: Re: [sfraves] my Devotion  (aka  discovering hardcore)

So would this be the 1st time that cops have come to the crackhouse? I 
mean, is it a common occurence, because last time I was there I don't 
remember any po showing up.

Dear Crazy Legged Vishal --> Glad you had a good time at Neulight :) 
give me a copy of that picture you took of me dancing!

and don't forget the "man over-board" dance move I taught you ;)

peace,
Chris

The cops have shown up all but once when I've been there.  They showed up 
once and stopped me in the middle of my set.  The cop stopped and asked if I 
had any country western in my bag.....thought that was odd.

Remember when the swat team/riot police showed up once? I think that was
pretty amusing. I'm still amazed that space is around.

soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sore today....soooooooooooo totally and completely sore.  don't let anyone ever tell you that:

 A) it will cost too much to do X to you hair or that: 

B) it will take too much time...

seriously, whatever you want barely costs anything once you know what you need to get the job done and takes little to no time whatsoever to achieve.....afterall, no matter what condition your hair is in, 

whether it is human, horse or synthetic weave, there is very little you can do to it once you've done it...i haven't even so much as run a comb through my tresses since monday night, and it looks stunningly stunning just the same. so does yours...

i love french people, by the way. all of the french women i love to talk to have the best sense of dress and makeup, and we get to speak french when we focus on things of that nature on top of it all, so it just makes life worth living.....french people know that people don't truly become their finest until they reach at least forty...it is not vanity that drives esthetic in france...it is simply good taste for fine living. :)

Some art pieces I spent a lot of time producing are in a robotics show
tomorrow. Naturally, after all the time I've spent on the damn things
and with other people in the same class, we need to go celebrate. We're
thinking about hitting up DNA to drink a few drinks and relax a bit
before finals come through. 
 
Anyone else going? 
 
I think the Industrial/ Techno will be just what the doctor ordered.

If you have a birthday you want to make sure nobody forgets, or you want to 
throw a rave, trance party, or any event you want, if you need a licensed 
company with equipment, and dj's to do just that, for cheap, please give me a 
call or email me.

Mr Party Planner
Hey, I was wanting to throw a going away party for my sister. She is going to 
away to college soon and we will all miss her. She loves going to those 
trancey raves. I have never been to one but she tells me a lot about them. It 
would make her soooo happy if you could get like Mars, Mystre, or Dyloot to 
play some disco trance.  What about free PLUR giveaways? Do you also supply 
partiE favors? please let me know ASAP. 
P.s.  Can you do a Massive? She tells me those are the best.

I saw these guys a couple of times at Barneveld, both a lot of fun. They

second the recommendation.

If you're looking for somewhere to buy toys, visit www.givingtree.org 
This is The Salvation Army's online Giving Tree program.  Here's how it works:  you buy one of the toys on the website, then WalMart.com ships it to a Salvation Army community center in your neighborhood (based on your zip code).  From there, the toy you buy will be given to a needy child.  It's that simple. 
I don't know if SFRaves is planning any sort of toy drive of their own, but I couldn't resist this chance to plug givingtree.org.  It's a great program, and it's our first year doing it online.  
Happy Holidays!!

I saw these guys a couple of times at Barneveld, both a lot of fun. They
know how to rock the dance floor, heh. If you haven't seen 'em yet, I
second the recommendation.

The Ambient Mafia's Sinful Sag Soiree
Friday, Dec. 6

Jezebel's Joint
510 Larkin St. @ Turk, San Francisco

9:30-2
$3
21+

Hey kids!

Come celebrate a buncha Sagittarius birthdays with us as we unleash the
Ambient Mafia's Sinful Sag Soiree! Don't let the name fool ya - there
won't be much ambient this night, more like an assortment of deliciously
evil breaks, techno and house. And as anyone who's seen us in
all-too-rare action will attest, we know how to rumble ya ass!

For anyone who hasn't been there, Jezebel's is a really cool bar in the
city. Nicknamed 'the bar for doms & daddies, strippers & trannies' - a
perfectly decadent spot for the Mafia to celebrate all things Sag.

Hope to see you all there! Since this is a public party, feel free to
invite whoever you want ... especially sags!

Lineup:
Upstairs: Shane; Derek Fieldsoe; Michael, the Red Stickman

Downstairs Lounge: Zac, Harken, Boomerang Fidget, Skye, Speakeasy Ray

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: DJ Dar-Que & Oliver Orzal on An Epiphany Of Sound

Hi all,
On today's show, we've got DJ Dar-Que and Oliver Orzal as guests,
bringing their styles of SF House to the airwaves to get your Thursday
started off in a proper fashion.  Oliver is scheduled until 11, being
followed by DJ Dar-Que who'll take us until Noon when we had the reins
over to Eric for more beats on Poptronica.

Always giving you the goodies, so listen in an win too.  We're at 90.1
FM, and online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu (I believe the streaming
problems have been fixed after the Big Game fiasco.)

Talk to you.

Well, It turns out that DJ Dar-Que got called in to work this morning,
so he's being rescheduled for Jan 2.  So mark that date down.  Dar-Que
is new to SF, just getting here from Chicago.  Do keep an ear out for
him, and catch him on the air on Jan 2nd.

God Bless!    Love, your sister in Christ, Tami 

It only takes a spark, to get a fire going;  'that's how it is with God's Love, once you've experienced it.  You spread God's love to everyone; you want to pass it on.' "

Subject: [sfraves] Seeking DJ Andee

Hey all,

I'm trying to track down DJ Andee (I may have the spelling wrong as I've
never seen it in print).  Does anybody know him and know how to contact
him?  The only other piece of information i can give you is that he is
from Atlanta (I think) and he played a party at the Mothership in May.

Thanks y'all!!!

Subject: [sfraves] Faith Guest list?

Sorry, I know I have posted about this before, but I was wondering if anyone 
out there has the new website for the guest list for faith?  I wanted to 
take a few out of towners there tonite and don't want to pay.  I finally get 
off early enough to make it to a club before the designated guest list 
closing.  Can anyone help me out.  Much appreciated.  You can either respond 
privately or to the list.

Thank you,
Aaron

Subject: [sfraves] holiday makeup insanity nrr

--0-1466698183-1039129439=:23354
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


every year every cosmetics company puts out some holiday makeup.  what that means is that there are a bunch of new shades of both matte and sparkling girly things that are either not in your personal collection or just slight variations of what you might already have and shouldn't you have those too? or that brand too? and doesn't the case look nice too? and look at that! it looks like a museum display under glass with really pretty lighting...fine art for purchase! estee lauder has two such things right now...like two really nice collections with 2 or 3 three lipsticks in each set and each set has what you know you already have or don't really need but might like to try and some nice brushes which we could all use constantly and oh my gosh, how to pick just one and be satisfied? especially when one of the collections is soooooooooooooooo huge and is only $45.00 for all the stuff, but you have to buy a fragrance to get that one for that price, and i already have a few estee lauder perfumes and many other perfumes and oils, so i wasn't planning on buying any perfume, and i wasn't really planning on buying a whole bunch of their makeup considering that i have some things that i was planning on buying already from another makeup company...some basics that will cost me fine, but i will use them up at least and that is good.....oh my gosh!!!!! AND i was trying to talk myself out of the first estee lauder kit when i saw the second one today that comes in a little red bag too and of course really pretty lipstick and some other goodies. shit!  i was trying to talk myself out of it, and trying to convince myself that i don't need all of those eyeshadows, and then i found myself reading the french version of elle and i saw all sorts of pictures with THOSE colors or similar ones, and maybe i have those colors too, i probably do, but this is high-end makeup for cheap. SHIT, especially in the first package i was looking at...it has this shimmery beige/pink powder in there with a soft fluffy little estee lauder brush...SHIT. :)

well as a matter of fact, yes.  :)  we have 2 shows - one from february, =
2000, one from march, 2001.  the 2000 show is one they put together for =
us in the studio and showcases their frickin unbelievable production and =
technical skill.  the 2001 show is the live DAT recording from the barn =
when they set the place on fire.  listening to the first 35 minutes of =
the 2001 show today gave me goose bumps.  you can hear the crowd in the =
background going off and there's another hour and half to go!

2000 - studio: http://www.thumpradio.com/sunproject.cfm

2001 - live!: http://www.thumpradio.com/sunproject2001.cfm

you can hear the journey in these sets for sure.  these guys take it to =
the next level, especially live.  here are a couple of reviews about =
them off our site:

"I didn't know what to expect at this show. I just knew a DJ friend had =
said they are cool and more times than not, if it's a THUMP party, it'll =
be fun, regardless. Well first they came out wearing Sleestak masks =
which was great and started into a killer set that I was way into. Then, =
out of nowhere, one of them jumps to the front of the stage with a =
guitar and starts jamming out this crunch guitar and everyone FREAKED =
OUT!!!!!! Including myself. These guys are phenomenal. If you get a =
chance to see them live, DO NOT MISS THEM!!!!"  --ektropsykadelia =20
=20
"Gotta agree - these guys are amazing. We saw 'em at Thump back in =
January and have been bopping to 'em frequently since. 'Tho a bit harder =
edged than your standard trance, it's that edge that really =
distinguishes them. If you can't catch 'em live, grab their albums - =
fantastic stuff."--Chris Head =20

big smiles - can't wait!

Subject: [sfraves] [bsp] Flux this Friday with DJ Push + More

Greets...

First, the details:

Friday, December 6th:

FLUX @ Il Pirata
2007 16th St. @ Potrero
9:00pm - 2:00am.
$3 before 10, $5 after
***Check the new micro-site for info, audio sets from past parties, and pics
from the nights: http://www.technoelf.com/flux

DJ Push [Future Breaks FM, True Intent, XLR8R]
Checkoway [Fogdin, Flux, Gaarden]
Cubby [SDR, Flux, Broken]
Spivak [SDR, Flux]
Jason Knight [SDR, Flux]

Then the details for those who care to read:

Flux is going strong into its 8th month, and we're excited to bring in one
of the strongest forces in the SF scene as our guest, DJ Push [Future Breaks
FM, True Intent, XLR8R]. For the last umpteen years (that's a long time,
folks), this man has been quietly, methodically pushing the music scene in
all the right directions. Whether it be laying down the latest and greatest
breakbeat jams of all flavors for the KUSF radio airwaves (Future Breaks FM)
or rocking the crowds down at The Top for True Intent Saturdays or giving
you the latest dish in the ever-essential music rag, XLR8R -- Push comes
correct each and every time.  You know the deal: breaks vs. house/tech, low
cover, cheap, stiff drinks, patio, drunk people.

Man, you have to have a hardcore week of raving planned before you drop $50

Not so much a hardcore week of raving, but years of it. You just have to
change the batteries and get the same effects of glowsticks. It's a cost
over time equation. Yeah you could just keep buying glowsticks, but with
these you could buy a set, 4 rechargable NiMH 1800MaH batteries and have a
renewable light toy. A bit more eco conscious. I'm thinking of just getting
some to keep in the car and to take camping. A few of these in a tent or
EzUP would rock for all night long illumination at a campout...

Subject: [sfraves] bird shit, no forwarding to Mommy




So there's this party thta I went to and the funniest thing happenned...A 
bird tookk a big shit in my eye while I was dancing my ass off....My 
question to the community is this,  Why does this shit only happen at 
parties and no where else.  Do parties call out to the bird shitting gods 
and tell them to look for me?  Societal coinkidinks involved with mass 
amounts of chill heads alll trying to avoid the 'shit in the eye' phenomena. 
  Plus it's not like I was staring up into the stars either, so this birdie 
(who does not want to be identified so I will use the name "LSD, which is 
short for "Little shitting Duck" No, so ayways  LSD took a huge shit right 
into my eye while dancing...it came flying over and "WHAMMMY!!!"  Of course 
this halted my dancing fun but never the less I just wiped that shit from my 
eye and made some really cool friends that night.

"and this one time at band camp..."

Please note that anything that comes from anybody named Myself must be aware 
that actual events probably were never 'actual' in the first place

This is for entertainement purposes only and should not be fowarded to your 
mother unless she's is a really hip chick.
Time to listen to some "hard NRG"  :P

I'm not crazy yet, there are a few more people I need to meet.
Peace
Danny Picard
maybe it was me that shit in my own eye?
Moral:if you get shit on, wipe that shit off and go have more fun than you 
were already having damn it.

Subject: [sfraves] (BSP) Marvelous at POW!

Hey folks,
We're back in action tomorrow night with our monthly Marvelous at POW,
6th and Mission in SF.  There's no cover this month, so there's no
reason not to stop by.

This time around we're bringing in guest DJs H.O.P. (The Icons - hip-hop
and turntablism) and Kaution (hip-hop and house.)  Residents are Oliver
Orzal, DJ Balou and myself.  I'm planning on staying on the techy side
of house myself this time around, and it's hard to predict what Oliver
or Balou might be in the mood for any given time.

Hope to see you there.  More info can be found here:
http://www.sfstation.com/clubs/pow.htm#marvelous

"An Epiphany of Sound" - 90.1 FM Thursdays from 9AM-Noon Pacific.

Well, me n my grrl own a whole bunch of coltronix streetlights. They are 
battery powered LED based glowsticks. They use camera batteries, which I 
don't think there is any way to recharge, but they are much brighter than 
any krill light I've seen so far

www.coltronix.net is the manufacturer, they have links to people who sell 
them.

Conservative Leader's Son Jailed In Road Rage Case

(CNSNews.com) - The son of a prominent Washington, D.C. conservative =
leader is scheduled to attend a hearing in federal court later this =
month after being arrested and charged with shooting at a driver. =20

Federal Magistrate Judge T. Rawls Jones, Jr., Friday scheduled a Dec. 17 =
hearing for David Michael Keene, son of American Conservative Union =
Chairman David A. Keene.

U.S. Park Police said the 21-year-old Keene was arrested Wednesday =
evening and is accused of firing a gun at another motorist while driving =
on a suburban Washington parkway last weekend.

Keene is scheduled to attend a preliminary and detention hearing on the =
17th , according to Sam Dibbley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorneys =
Office in Alexandria, Virginia.

The preliminary and detention hearing will determine whether Keene will =
remain in his Alexandria, Va. jail cell and whether there is enough =
evidence for the case to proceed.=20

If there is sufficient evidence, the judge is expected to schedule a =
status hearing at which point, a trial date would be set.=20

Keene was being held Friday on federal charges involving "the use of a =
firearm during a crime of violence," according to U.S. Park Police Sgt. =
Scott Fear.

Fear said Keene allegedly shot a bullet into another car Dec. 1 while =
traveling along a stretch of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, =
shattering the car's rear window.=20

The bullet lodged in the driver's seat and came within inches of =
striking the driver, police said.

The driver of the other vehicle took down the license plate number of =
the car from which the shot was allegedly fired and called police, who =
later arrested Keene. Fear said a weapon was found in Keene's =
possession, but Fear declined to offer any information about it.

Keene's father, besides being chairman of the ACU, is also on the board =
of directors of the National Rifle Association, which said the group's =
thoughts and prayers go out to the Keene family, according to NRA =
spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.

"This matter is in the hands of law enforcement and if any laws are =
broken, it has to be dealt with just like any other case," Arulanandam =
said. "Celebrity parents have to deal with these issues all the time and =
during this difficult time, our hearts go out to the parents."

If convicted, Keene could face up to 10 years in prison.

Crooks, playstations at the bar and a comic book theme.  Best of all,
there's no cover tonight.

This time around we're bringing in guest DJs H.O.P. (The Icons - hip-hop
and turntablism) and Kaution (hip-hop and house.)  Residents are Oliver
Orzal, DJ Balou and myself.  I'm planning on staying on the techy side
of house myself this time around, and it's hard to predict what Oliver
or Balou might be in the mood for any given time.

Hope to see you there.  More info can be found here:

I got reimbursment tickets in the mail for ouroboros today
with a nice written note from Apollo.  

I will personally be missing this party as I've had a trip
to Seattle planned that weekend but I'm sending my cousin
Jordi who will do as my substitute for the night. ;) 

Just a note to say that Moksha Tribe is one class act!

Karina...an extraordinary woman who can recite French poetry in the 
original and translation while in the boys' room at underground 
parties.  Wishing you a new year of love and light, Karina.  Happy 
Birthday!!!!!!

Subject: [sfraves] nrr:sociopath president?

I found this really disturbing but still fascinating  I
shall be looking at Bush's verbal mistakes more
carefully. Interesting how he cannot verbalize feelings
that are not congruent with him to come out correctly.
It makes me wonder if I do that too.


Bush anything but moronic, according to author
Dark overtones in his malapropisms
MURRAY WHYTE -- ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER

When Mark Crispin Miller first set out to write
Dyslexicon:  Observations on a National Disorder", about
the ever-growing catalogue of President George W.
Bush's verbal gaffes, he meant it for a laugh. But what
he came to realize wasn't entirely amusing.

Since the 2000 presidential campaign, Miller has been
compiling his own collection of Bush-isms, which have
revealed, he says, a disquieting  truth  about what lurks
behind the cock-eyed leer of the leader of the free
world.
He's not a moron at all. On that point, Miller and
Prime Minister Jean Chretien agree.

But according to Miller, he's no friend.

"I did initially intend it to be a funny book. But that
was before I  had a chance to read through all the
transcripts," Miller, an American author and a
professor of culture and communication at New York
University, said recently in Toronto.

"Bush is not an imbecile. He's not a puppet. I think
that Bush is a sociopathic personality. I think he's
incapable of empathy. He has an inordinate sense
of  his own entitlement, and he's a very skilled
manipulator. And in all the snickering about his alleged
idiocy, this is what a lot of people miss."

Miller's judgment, that the president might suffer from
a bona fide personality disorder, almost makes one long
for the less menacing nbotion currently making the
rounds: that the White House's current occupant is, in
fact,  simply an
idiot.

If only.  Miller's rendering of the president is
bleaker than that.  In studying Bush's various adventures
in oration, he started to see a pattern emerging.

"He has no trouble speaking off the cuff when he's
speaking punitively, when he's talking about violence,
when he's talking about revenge.

"When he struts and thumps his chest, his syntax and
grammar are fine," Miller said. "It's only when he leaps
into the wild blue yonder of  compassion, or idealism, or
altruism, that he makes these hilarious mistakes."

While Miller's book has been praised for its "eloquence"
and "playful use of language," it has enraged Bush
supporters.

Bush's ascent in the eyes of many Americans - his
approval rating hovers at near 80 percent - was the
direct result of tough talk following the Sept.11
terrorist attacks. In those speeches, Bush stumbled not
at all; his language of retribution was clear.

It was a sharp contrast to the pre-9/11 George W. Bush.

Even before the Supreme Court in 2001 had to intervene
and rule on recounts in Florida after a contentious
presidential election, a corps of journalists were
salivating at the prospect: a bafflingly inarticulate man
in a position of power not seen  since vice-president Dan
Quayle rode shotgun on George H.W. Bush's one term
in office.

But equating Bush's malapropisms with Quayle's
inability to spell "potato" is a dangerous assumption,
Miller says.

At a public address in Nashville, Tenn., in September,
Bush provided one of his most memorable stumbles.  Trying
to give strength to his case that  Saddam Hussein had
already deceived the West concerning his store of
weapons,
Bush was scripted to offer an old saying: Fool me once,
shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me. What came out
was the following:  "Fool me once, shame ...shame
on ... you."  Long, uncomfortable pause. "Fool
me....can't get fooled again!"

Played for laughs everywhere, Miller saw a darkness
underlying the gaffe. "There's an episode of Happy Days,
where The Fonz has to say, 'I'm  sorry' and can't do it.

Same thing,"  Miller said.

"What's revealing about this is that Bush could not
say, 'Shame on me' to save his life. That's a completely
alien idea to him. This is a guy who is absolutely proud
of his own inflexibility and rectitude."

If what Miller says is true - and it would take more
than just observations to prove it - then Bush has
achieved an astounding goal.

By stumbling blithely along, he has been able to push
his image as "just folks" - a normal guy who screws up
just like the rest of us.

This, in fact, is a central cog in his image-making
machine, Miller  says: Portraying the wealthy scion of
one of America's most powerful families as a regular,
imperfect Joe.

But the depiction, Miller says, is also remarkable for
what it hides - imperfect, yes, but also detached,
wealthy and unable to identify with the  "folks" he's
been designed to appeal to.

An example, Miller says, surfaced early in his
presidential tenure. "I know how hard it is to put food
on your family," Bush was quoted as saying.

"That wasn't because he's so stupid that he doesn't
know how to say, 'Put food on your family's table.' It's
because he doesn't care about people who can't put food
on the table," Miller says.

So, when Bush is envisioning "a foreign-handed foreign
policy," or observes on some point that "it's not the way
that America is all about," Miller contends it's because
he can't keep his focus on things that mean  nothing to
him.

"When he tries to talk about what this country stands
for, or about democracy, he can't do it," he said.

This, then, is why he's so closely watched by his
handlers, Miller says - not because he'll say something
stupid, but because he'll overindulge in  the
language of violence and punishment at which he excels.

"He's a very angry guy, a hostile guy. He's much like
Nixon.  So they're very, very careful to choreograph
every move he makes.  They don't want him anywhere near
protestors, because he would lose his temper."

Miller, without question, is a man with a mission - and
laughter isn't it.

"I call him the feel bad president, because he's all
about punishment and death," he said. "It would be a
grave mistake to just play him for laughs."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] holiday makeup insanity nrr

i wanted to add more to this post....i don't want to
exclude anyone at all. so basically, i think what we
really need to do is have a scummy, stinky, sweaty,
oily dank smoking acid trippy ugly hippy girls only
party. someone get on it quick, because i can tell you
for sure that there are enough followers of that life
plan to keep you in business for life if your into
it...hey, i hear some of these kinds of people even
get laid and occasionally remember it...do they climax
half as good as i do though? doubtful....anyway,
didn't buy the kit, but hope you checked it out (the
estee lauder kit that is)...there's also a lot of
glitter and shimmer makeup being put out in several
lines, which is why, when you finally pull your ass
out of bed or your finger out of your ass and then go
out and keep your head out of there too, you might
notice that a lot of girls who actually shower in the
morning and have social lives are wearing this
stuff....glitter is in and for underneath, lacey
tanga's....which brings me to my current lingerie
collection status...yes, my panty collection has grown
again. of course, gotta dress up for "the" occasion.
have you ever thought of what makes a panty sexy or
sex worthy? i've been wondering for a while, because
usually, i am pretty good about finding out what types
of clothing drives the people mad, but really just
because someone likes lacey things or cotton or
whatever for arousal purposes, doesn't mean that i do.
i like to wear the pretty things, so to clarify my
personal fetish or one of them, it is not so much the
lace and the stockings that personally get me going.
it is the way my partner feels about it-them or reacts
to it-them. hope that clears things up a bit. naughty
or not. :)

Julie,

I'm glad to hear you climax good.

As for those hippie girls... maybe what sets them apart is that they don't
send off topic self indulgent drivel to the Phish list or where ever it is
they hang out on line.

Just a thought,
andyw

Why Julie, what a spite and prejudice-filled post! It makes the sender out
to be the truly ugly one. Thanks for sharing your holiday season cheer with
us this morning. You've earned my pity and finally lost all my respect. JP

I am from Jersey, Channel Isles. It is a small little Island by France, which is in Europe. You can see France on a nice day, and some of the old folk have these funny english/french accents. You can walk around the whole island in a day, it's only 45 miles square. The kids however are bang into dance culture, having plenty of nice old castles to set up raves in, and and a seemingly endless supply of cash to party with.  (thanks daddy)
Ross' top 6 list of famous jersey boys in house. 
1. Guru Josh.  Used to be called the Animal and was famous for his "Pervert's Ball's" long before his house days. Fed up of late 80's bored new romantic types, he decides to create the best sax solo on a house record ever, by releasing Infinity, and rereleasing it every year, until there are indeed, infinite copies. 
2. Lee Mullin.  Lucky Lonzo, the quiet kid in my class, once came skiing and broke his arm, upon return from the cruel slopes he was gifted the news his dog died. Bored with being the butt of everyones jokes he decided to become famous for wearing white suits and being the keyboard player for HYBRID. Then toured the world and won best live act 2001 for there performance in IBiza. He now only gets out of bed if the supermodel he shares it with decides that yes, $10,000 is Ok for a days work. 
3. James Reynolds. Forbidden to inherit his father's title "Lord Reynolds" by tony blairs UK government, James decides that London still needs him, so he remixes "a rose is still a rose" for Aretha Franklin and along with Mat Jam Lamont and freinds invents UK 2 step garage. 
4. Andy Chatterley. Always the pale kid, we certainly wondered what was going on with chatters at all times. Keyboard to Mark Laws guitar in local band Hunt the Dark Knight, the teenager discovers original acid house, turns left at greenland, then heads to London to be a part of the free party movement, and was envied by all. Turns up as engineer on Eddie Lock record after keeping himself busy by being missing for over 10 years. 
5. Ilker Ulkan (the turk.) Kept Jersey scene buzzing very nicely. Jealousy forces him to leave Jersey, so he goes to Slinky with Gaz White and get's job flying aroung the bloody world buying new trainers, so he can seriously flout the "No Sportswear" rule at UK clubs.Nice One.  

6. Me. After being gifted by god at being not good at really anything in particular, ross stumbles through life shamelessly self promoting himself and his freinds. This leads to interest from the majors, who set out to cut this rough diamond into a commodity with eventual corporate salary. What voodoo helped this publicist get cushty deskjob and plasma screen to boot? Could it be that his work output is minimal, yet done with a smile. Or is it simply that he is the luckiest lad in la la land.

Subject: [sfraves] Sac dances at ETD3!

Yeah, so the other people picked me up late as usual. I knew we would not 
get there before 10 haha. I hoped I would not miss out on who I wanted to 
see!
I slept most of the way in the car, because I had slept so little the
previous night, didnt go to bed till 4 or so heh heh.
Satoshi, the Japanese dude & Yong , a chinese guy were both hardcore
ravers. Satoshi had started way back, he has been all over the country
since maybe 6 or 7 years back while the other guy had started a little bit 
before I did.
They were very excited that they had met me , so now they knew someone
else who they could go with. Well, the feeling was mutual. Though I said , I 
did not know if I would be here next semester. But we'll be in touch, they 
insisted that I call them whenever I get back. That I definitely will! The 
car was built pretty rave ish too, it had blinking lights on the outside & 
more stuff. They played thumping trance all the way. Not that I minded, I 
was too busy sleeping:)
We finally got there a little bit before 10. It was soooo cold, as we
hurried to the venue. It turned out to be a huge ballroom, which was very 
nice. There was a good wooden floor to dance & jump on , all night long, 
yay!
The decorations were there and so was the crowd. Oh well, the crowd was
always there at Sac parties. This would be the clincher, I would know
finally whether Sac ravers actually wiggled their asses.
I saw the lineup, & I was pleased that the dj's I wanted to see had not
come on yet.
There was like 5 minutes left before it was time for Valerie Sparks!
I was sooo hyper about seeing her, after how much I loved dancing to Molly 
at Devotion!  Oh yeah baby, I was jumping up & down and moving in time to 
the beats that spun out of her magical fingers.
Every now & then, she would look up at the crowd & wave her hands in the
air and urge us on to dance even harder. She has a very lovely smile.
A couple of times during the hour she looked at me directly & smiled. And I 
melted away into the ground like the liquid mercury man does in
Terminator2. Except  I just flowed all around, dancing a crazy rhythm of
my own.  The intense feeling that raged inside me only served to make me
realise even more how much fun I was having. Hey, I also found that I did 
not have to keep up with the beat as long as I was in sync with it heh heh
Yeah, the other part of that hour, Micro was good too.
I glanced around me now & then, & who do I see. Someone very familiar...I 
keep seeing her at the Sac raves, it was Terri! She looked sooo hot:) I went 
over to give her a big hug. She was there, getting her groove on alright!
Too bad, the hour flew by so fast. But it was good it did too, because I
would have completely worm myself out otherwise.
I think the last one that Valerie spun was "love you down"? I think that
is a really neat song.  She walked off the stage & I went over to say hi.
I hugged her, & said I really enjoyed her set. She says, thank you for
coming out here. And then she was gone.
At this point, they had jungle/turntablism going on, this was my chance to 
catch my breath before Dina rips everything up once again!
I went and sat down on the stage where Terri was in a chair.
I was foolish once again to forget my earplugs in the car! so I wanted to 
not expose myself as much as often to the loud volume.
It was fun hanging out with Terri, she massaged my shoulders a wee bit as I 
sat there on the floor. She said she could feel lots of knots on my
shoulders. I said, yeah it must be, because I also dance so much ballroom, 
where I had to keep a frame. The jungle music was not bad at all.
Terri said she could totally get lost in the hypnotic rhythms it could
induce. I had to agree with that.
This is kind of funny, I always viewed jungle as something off limits to
me, the same thought as hardcore. But I was beginning to change, I could
see her point there. She went off to dance some to it, but I still rested 
for a while. The beats were pretty awesome, I just did not like it that the 
mc was shrieking over that volume. It hurt my ears at times. Maybe they 
ought to take a note of that.
Oooh oooh oooh, it was almost witching hour, I saw Dina come in & I went
up to talk to her a little bit. It was so good to see her again, the last 
time was Alchemy? Ha this time she had hair styled differently, it looked 
cool:)
I think at some point that night, she asked me what I thought of
Sac now, I said hell yeah, they do dance and this was a great party.
Soon, it was time for Dina & Denise. Ooh , this was going to be so
heavenly, I shot off straight to the bathroom so I didnt have to go
anytime in the next hour heh heh.
And then, it was time....Denise started it all off. The crowd adored her
as I did too. Even though it was my first time seeing her spin, I already 
knew I loved it. At different points where the music would fade a wee bit, 
she would raise her hands  and everyone on the floor would do that too. Me 
too!  Oye, & then Dina stepped up. Oh yeah, I yelled and I screamed as much 
as my lungs would allow me too. There she was, her agile fingers all in a 
flurry flying over the decks and her body grooving at the same time. Dead 
cool (& hard) beats pounded out of the speakers(there were a few speakers 
right there in the middle along with the usual left & right box of them) and 
I was dancing even harder.
I did not mention, when I was standing there right before Dina's set, I
had my hands plugging my ears as I stood there waiting for her to start.
I felt a tap on my shoulder, & this girl gave me a couple of ear plugs.
They were the ones that kind of stick when you press it against the ear
canal. I was so glad, I was very grateful to her for that. And I dont even 
know her name, didnt see her later on either.
Back to the music, they were throwing goodies into the crowd sometime into 
the set. So yeah, that made things even livelier. The crowd went crazy 
trying to catch everything out there in the air. They threw glowing rings 
first, I tried to catch some, but I didnt. And then, the guy who was 
throwing them, looked straight at me & aimed & I got one. Later on I knew 
this was dj scepter. I put this glowing ring on my head as in like a wreath 
or laurel and kept dancing. Someone later on that night, took it away from 
me because he said he would give me a buck. I said oh yeah, I'll take that!  
Speaking of that, I saw a recent post about battery charged alternatives, I 
thought that would be neat to get at some point.
Did I say something about the crowd, oh my gosh, the floor was sooooo
packed like sardines in a tin can. And everyone was dancing like crazy!!
They also threw more stuffed animals & other stuff. I was just dancing, I 
did not want any of that heh heh. One negative aspect of this was that, it 
drew some people out there in front who were just there to catch all those 
things. They were really rude & this one guy literally tried shoving me to 
the side so he could stand there & grab something!  No that could not make 
me angry, no way was anyone ruining my day, (rather night)
Well, all these people faded away once they stopped tossing stuff, and
then the floor belonged to the dancing fools:)
Everytime Dina came back or did something, I would be there, waving my
hands madly and shouting & cheering her on. I tried jumping really high at 
times, but found that it wore me out if I did it too often heh heh.
That hour was the best part of the night for me. I totally wore myself out 
dancing madly. Yeah, I could have paced myself for the rest of the night.
But how could I resist when Dina spun like that???
Oh yeah, while I was sittting there with Terri before Dina's set, I was
talking to her about nye, I didnt know what to do. I did not like the idea 
of Coolworld too much because I fear it will be too massive & anyway more 
importantly the vibe...it might be so different. Terri said go to Seattle! 
heh heh. And now I cant get it out of my head, contemplating the wild & 
impossible.
There was a roar that went up around the room when Dina & Denise were
done, & I joined in. After that it was Tom Slik & then Scepter. I danced
for a little while, and then I knew I had to take a break soon.
Dina was throwing rather sprinkling water on the heads that were dancing by 
the stage. Aaah, the cool water must have felt nice!
Which was alright  because Mystre/Dyloot were coming on. I went and sat
down at the very back of the room while they came on. I did not go dance
for any part of their set. It was exactly the same old stuff that I heard 
before at Wish and then some at Popsikle.
To quote Terri, its like pop
radio, they play the same songs over & over and there is this certain
group of people that never seem to get enough of it.  That's not me!
Yes, the first time was awesome @popsikle. That will always have a place
in my heart. here's hoping they will change sometime, even thought the
hope right now will be futile.
Terri teaches and it was so funny when she said, that she never sees any
of her students out there while she always dances. I think its awesome. I 
wish I had that life. That way I could be around school and still get away & 
party.
I saw Britty another raver from earlier raves, she slipped on yet another 
piece of candy onto my wrist:)
I went up in front to dance for the summerhayes, they were pretty decent.
Yes, the crowd was fading, I mean getting smaller. Still I danced, Dina
came up to me sometime during that set, to say she was leaving.
We bid adieu & I wonder if I shall ever see her spin again? Because I am
gone(maybe for a long long time?) after nye...I am really sad about that.
I was soo tired when it was 4 am, I could not stay for the last set.
The people with me felt the same so we took off.
Halfway back home, a tire went flat. they found that someone had slashed
it back there , when it was parked for the night. How weird, I thought
something like that would more likely happen in Oakland or something but
not there. And it was so silly, that the car did not even have a spare.
I didnt know whether to laugh or what haha.  We drove on that flat tire
for , I dont know maybe 5 miles or was it 15? I was sleeping so I dont
remember much except the constant rattling of the car. They managed to get
it fixed somewhere, lucky them that it did not screw up the rim.
So I got home at 10 and then drifted away....

The Benefits of Water
75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated.

In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often
mistaken for hunger.

Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%.

One glass of water shuts down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100%of =
the
dieters studied in a U-Washington study.
Lack of water is the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue.

Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could
significantly ease back and
joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.

A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, =
trouble
with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a
printed page.

Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by =
45%,
plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50%
less likely to develop bladder cancer.

Are you drinking the amount of water you should every day?


Of course, too much water may have strange side effects  =AD

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: The Benefits Of Water

Wow, great article.  I just got over some kidney stones so I've been doing 
alot more research on stuff myself.  From what my doctor said its not really 
how much you drink a day because some people retain more than others.  Its 
all personal.  Some can get by with 6, some need alot more.  Too much of 
course depletes electrolytes.

What he said is more important, at least in keeping your system running 
clean is you should be peeing 2 - 3 quarts of fluid a day.  Drink 4-6 
overall but if you're not getting rid of enough, drink more.

As for me, I've recently been having one of those Odwalla Superfood's every 
morning.  I have a can of Mt. Dew (used to drink a 12er or 2 a day easy) in 
the morning and then a superfood when I get to work.  This stuff is more 
amazing than coffee and red bull combined when you start drinking it 
regularly.  I've had more energy lately than I've had in years.  So now I 
have a soda in morning and at night for taste, then superfood and water 
throughout the day. :)

The Benefits of Water
75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated.

In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often
mistaken for hunger.

Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%.

One glass of water shuts down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100%of the
dieters studied in a U-Washington study.
Lack of water is the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue.

Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could
significantly ease back and
joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.

A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble
with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a
printed page.

Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%,
plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50%
less likely to develop bladder cancer.

Are you drinking the amount of water you should every day?


Of course, too much water may have strange side effects  ­

He does realize that the *ban* on glowsticks as drug paraphernalia  was
overturned? Any idiot agent that says anything relating to glow sticks or
pacifiers is full of shit. Call the aclu and emdef and let them know what's
happening. I'm not a fan of 1015, but I'm less a fan of ignorant law
enforcement using scare tactics. Next time the ABC shows up and pulls a
stunt like this make sure that 1015 has an attourney around. I'd like to see
the result.

"The agent stated that according to the DEA guidelines Ten15 is a rave due
to the late night operations, the presence of glow sticks, loud techno
music, the presence of EMT's and excessive sales of water."

I wish there was some way to figure out what the fuck the DEA is thinking
here, exactly. Get rid of techno music? That's a freedom-of-expression
issue, the government can't pull that kind of shit. Stop selling water?
It's as though no one can do right by these people - you drink too much,
they're on your ass for public drunkeness. Drink too little, you /must/ be
high. The glowstick thing is just absurd. I fail to see how any of this
doesn't fall under the category of "circumstancial evidence." Places like
1015 try to do right by their patrons by providing EMT's and water and
various other services, and they end up getting slapped down anyway.

Seems like the exective branch of the government has a bug up their ass
about people dancing all night and choosing forms of recreation that are
either outside the law, can't be regulated/taxed/risk-assessed for
insurance purposes, or don't represent a desirable target market for
advertisers.

I love the line about drinking an excess of water to counteract the dehydrating effects of ecstacy. Um, what about drinking water to counteract the dehydrating effect of dancing? Damn, with all the water I drink at work and the techno music I listen to on my computer, my work might get shut down for being a rave!

This is, of course, absurd and if I were the operators of 1015 and other 
public venues I would seek the advice of good attorneys as well as support 
from the ACLU.  The oppression has begun once again.  I have no desire to 
see the clubs go away, although my dancing these days is mostly 
underground.  But this is just "level one."  If they knock out all public 
dancing in this country using these guidelines, then they will move to any 
party where there is electronic music available at "unreasonable" hours 
(10:00 PM?).

BTW, I wonder what constitutes "excessive sales of water?"  Would they 
prefer people drink more booze?  Ahhh....it's all fuckin' crazy, and the 
direction of this country is really making me think about getting the hell 
out before the black SUVs arrive at my door.  Heil Bush!!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 1015/Circus visited by ABC... 1015 bans glowsticks

Oh my god that makes me sick.  Not only are they making normal things 
paraphenelia, they're the things I USE SOBER TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT!  This is 
such BS.  I'm not saying 1015 Circus wasn't in the wrong here, I mean hell.  
If you have employees having 10k pills confiscated then they deserve to be 
jailed and I'm surprised they didn't have door security at the club.  It 
sounds like they had it coming but that doesn't change the fact that us 
people who don't partake in illegal substances (often, I'm not saying I 
don't) on a regular basis need to suffer the lock down on the things we use 
to keep us going.

I go out sober from illegal things 95% of the time.  Hell, I only drink 
about 50% of the time. If I do choose to be on something when I go out, I 
take it before I go in or get to the party.  Not only do I not want to get 
in trouble during a search, I don't want the venue owner to get in trouble 
for me being caught doing it inside by someone who doesn't work there and 
have it shut down for them.  As for the smaller intimate clubs that look the 
other way for the bay areas non-drug drug Miss Mary, I still feel paranoid 
doing it in someone elses place of business for their sake.

And as nice a guy as I like to think I am I have no sympathy for dealers at 
events that get caught.  They endanger the party and state of the whole 
scene for us.  I'm hypocritical to a point because I have bought at parties 
before, just usually not for myself and I feel bad about having done it now 
as well because its irresponsible for the scenes sake.

Do not take this for me not liking people who go to parties blasted out of 
their minds, thats how they like to party and I can't judge them for that.. 
but please just be responsible and don't put the party and promoter in 
danger.  I don't hate the dealers either, its just when they have trouble 
with the man, it spills over onto the rest of us as well.

Be a scout.  Be prepared for your party ;)

Trinka Porrata is one of those names that everyone here should be very
familiar with.

I've been seeing her listed as a "national expert on clubs and raves" for
at least 5 or 6 years now - she's a retired LAPD officer, who is notable
for the size of the chip on the her shoulder, and the volume of
misinformation she sells to news agencies and government organizations on
the topic of club drugs.

This woman makes a living by fanning the flames of misunderstanding and
profiting from the chaos that follows.

Fuck 'er.

Why, is she hot?  ;)

Seriously, though, something needs to be done to shut these misinformants
up, or at least get the truth out there.  There's this incredibly
annoying-ass, yahtzee-playing, talks-way-outside-of-her-personal area
lardass bitch who's at my local Starbucks every night, spouting off about
some topic.  The other night, she was going off about drugs and "rave drugs"
in particular, spouting off one mistruth after another, all of it very
obviously derived from watching too much 20/20 and reading too much crap
like this.  Of course, she went even beyond by saying, "Don't go to a rave -
someone can dose you with Ecstasy simply by touching you with it."  I was
too shocked to even yell at her.

At any rate, THOSE are the kinds of misconceptions that Joe Public swallows
wholeheartedly, making innocuous things like bottled water and Red Bull seem
like the marks of the devil.  It's fucking ridiculous.

What I find wierdest about these kinds of misconceptions is that they
basically ignore all normal standards of human rationality. "Someone can
dose you" ... "A cooling off area staffed by EMT's" ... "too much water."

I guess it's fairly obvious that none of these people have ever had the
pleasure of dancing in a hot sweaty club, and the needs that it entails:
proper hydration, and a bit of rest once in a while. If they think our
motives are so out of whack, they must really think that we are in some
fundamental way /different/ from them, and therefore probably undeserving
of rights, respect, or human dignity.

Scary.

Just had one of my models cancel and I need a replacement.  The part is for

the show is on Sunday and would require the entire day due to extensive
body painting.  Please pass this on to any interested parties.

If all this could be addressed with reason and logic, Mike, there would be 
no oppression.  The roots of this social control lie far beyond the pale of 
reason.  Real issues in the country -- the economy, unemployment, poverty 
and the like -- are not being addressed efficiently.  Instead we have a 
government waging war on various folks, including us, to divert attention 
from problems they are not prepared to solve.  Corporations own most of the 
public press.  Corporate interests are more and more in line with 
government interests.  Mussolini defined Fascism as the merger of corporate 
and national interests.

Beyond this logic, there is the ongoing and deep fear in this Puritan 
culture of pleasure and any non-productive activity.  This is nothing new, 
and has served as the basis for much oppression and persecution.  We have 
merely substituted science for sin, and use unsubstantiated "scientific" 
beliefs and manipulated statistics and other data to recreate the Puritan 
state which, to my mind, was, and can be again, every bit as oppressive as 
the Taliban.

Fear brings suspicion of any deviation from the norm.  We have agreed as a 
nation to forgo freedom for security.  The results are just beginning to be 
manifest.

You said half-baked twice, so does that mean she is fully baked, like 
cookies? 8)

Thanks for saying all that I couldn't have said. In alphabetical order, 
too! Talk about self-absorbed!

P.S. Did you forget anything in your list of adjectives? I can add a 
few ;)

Do you LICK your envelopes ????

This is a true story reported on CNN
If you lick your envelopes...You won't anymore!!!! A
woman was working in a post office in California. One day she
licked the envelopes and postage stamps instead of using a sponge. That
very day, the lady cut her tongue on the envelope. A week later, she
noticed an abnormal swelling of her tongue.

She went to the doctor, and they found nothing
wrong. Her tongue was not sore or anything. A couple of days later,
her tongue started to swell more, and it began to get really sore, so
sore, that she could not eat. She went back to the hospital, and
demanded
something be done. The doctor took an x-ray of her tongue,and noticed a
lump.

He prepared her for minor surgery.
When the doctor cut her tongue open, a live roach
crawled out. There were roach eggs on the seal of the envelope.
The egg was able to hatch inside of her tongue,
because of her saliva. It was warm and moist.

Andy Hume wrote:
Hey, I used to work in an envelope factory. You
wouldn't believe the.....things that float around in
those gum applicator trays. I haven't licked an envelope for
years.

To All:
I used to work for a print shop 32 years ago and we
were told NEVER to lick the envelopes. I never understood why
until I had to go into storage and pull out 2500 envelopes that were
already printed for a customer who was doing a mailing and saw several
squads of
roaches roaming around inside a couple of boxes with eggs everywhere.
They
eat the glue on the envelopes. I think print shops have a harder time
controlling
roaches than a restaurant. I always buy the self sealing type. Or
if need be I use a glue stick to seal one that has the type of glue
that
needs to be wet to stick.


PLEASE PASS THIS ON!!!! STOP DOING IT




God Bless!    Love, your sister in Christ, Tami 

Light the Advent candle, one: Now the waiting has begun; We have started on our way, time to think of Christmas Day.  Light the advent candle 2; think of humble shepherds who, Filled with wonder at the sight of the child on Christmas night.

I once got roaches in my ears from hearing too much commercial trance at a
party.  The cheese in the beats attract roaches, who then lay their eggs
in the grooves (scientists have proven that the grooves trigger the part
of the abdomen that triggers egg laying behavior in female and type II
hermaphroditic roaches) and then those eggs are amplified over the sound
system, causing anybody within reach to risk infection.

This also happened (well something similar) in Pittsburgh at a party
called "The Journey Continues pt. IV".  Said Samuel Rollins, the promoter
"Mars was playing closing his set with that Pachabel track and everybody
started feeling antennae tickling around in their ears... we didn't
realize till later... that track is so cheesy that the roaches were
hatching at unheard of rates."  He continues, eyes growing wide from the
intensity of the memory "It was late in the party, some people had trouble
figuring out if it was really happening".  Similar complaints stemmed from
a playing of "A fifth of Beethoven", a popular classical dance music
remake from disco's dying days at an underground disco event in lower
Manhattan almost 25 years before.

In other parts of the world, changes in music and local flora and fauna
often result in strange distortions of this disturbing scientific
anamoly... like an outbreak last year of "kutiz", an indigenous Yemenese
insect with four sphincters around each of it's three eyes after a local
DJ played a Mushroom Jazz through Microsoft's secure IIS server after
eating Taco Bell followed by some herbal viagra at a local American hotel
complex that employs date rape drugged slave labor.

If you add your name to the top (do not cheat, break the chain and we all
lose!  Margaret Hemmins of Muscogee, Oklahoma did this and got hit by a
boat on a trailer in front of a bar just 32 days later!) and send five
dollars and this mail to the LAST five people on the list.

Lots of people have already won!  All you have to do is send your money to
the names at the top, put their names and your name at the bottom, and
wait for your millions to come in!  Practically the only thing you can do
to screw this up is send a crosspost message to several hundred people
warning of a silly urban legend!

(Tami, I think you meant well, but that story is a tad far fetched...
good ways to check up on a story like this before sending include
checking CNN's website, or looking up "roaches eggs envelope glue" at
Google.com)

Feh...  "lack of drug or weapon searches at the front door", my ass.  At least
they got the "extensive security" part right.  Last time I set foot in that
cesspool, the knuckle-dragger at the door did everything short of a
strip-search, even feeling up my crotch and sticking its grubby little paws up
under my t-shirt; all the while telling me that the place was wired for CCTV
and that if they even suspected that I was under the influence of "drugs" (And
just what the fuck is the alcohol that they sell (in large quantity)?  F-ing
hypocrites.) they'd haul me out and hand me over to the pigs on the spot.  (Of
course, that didn't keep the *dealers* out tho.  I was offered pills EVERY
single time I ever went there.)

Then again, it does appear that the cops, once again, need to be beaten down
with the cluestick.  But I really don't know who to side with on this one...

On the one hand, there's nothing in this world that's too bad to happen to 1015
and their merry little band of thugs.

On the other hand, a federal court *DID* rule that glowsticks, bottled water,
etc. are *NOT*, in fact, "drug paraphernailia".  And it WOULD be nice to see
the cops slapped down again.


cya,
john

"Porrata identified the club as a "rave" event due to the lack of drug or
weapon searches at the front door, extensive security, numerous patrons
under the influence of designer drugs, the type of music, laser lighting,
glow sticks, sales of water bottles and so-called power drinks with a high
concentration of caffeine such as Red Bull, an outside cooling off area, and
other factors"

So a lack of searches at the door makes an event a rave?  Laser lighting?
Shit, the Pink Floyd show I went to at the Rose Bowl was a megarave, then.
And the high-caffeine drinks?  Hell, then my engineering department is a
rave collective, what with all the Amp and Jolt they drink.

I could've sworn the outside cooling-off area was a result of anti-smoking
laws in the State of California, but I could be wrong.  ::shrug::

Fuckwits.

Subject: [sfraves] 1015 glowsticks nrr

1015 always had the best glowsticks. this is true: i
must have mentioned this before: i once had a 1015
glowstick that glowed bright for at least a
week....bright like the night sky before the
rain...one of my favorite colors....i can't and refuse
to believe that people who spend any time whatsoever
in san francisco don't notice anything besides what is
in the brain up there....it makes me think that people
go to the wearhouse and no where else, and that is
probably the case....the computer, the wearhouse, and
don't even look around and notice anyone or anything
but where the car is parked...maybe watch out for some
isolated bugs or something like that, and then head
directly for the nearest greasyspoon and wolf down
some sort of fair in routine mindless fashion. your
completely missing out, if this is the case...it is
also common knowledge amongst police forces
nationwide, the going rate for an ecstacy pill or an
eighth of maryjane, street value, that is.....i
understand and see quite clearly that many youngsters
(of course, i use that word in total nerdom.....give
me a frigg'in break...when does anyone get to the
point where they can use a word like youngsters and
not also simultaneously be wearing some sort of, oh,
mid-leg length shorts made out of polyester and maybe
some knee-hi athletic socks...it's the weekend attire
for the middle-aged, i suppose, and it goes with
youngsters...that and a baseball cap of some sort that
has a predominating color that directly clashes with
the shorts....young'ins)....anyway though, something
that you might consider is that your money goes a lot
farther than you might think, as i continually try to
put forth, and that you might consider some other ways
to gain satisfaction in your life that your current
group of friends might not....you don't have to paint
your face...how about canvas instead? have you ever
once stepped inside of an art supply shop? why not go
totally techie while your at it? do you see my
point?...if you can actually read and follow this,
besides the fact that i have a way with words, it has
a lot to do with the good fortune that your brain
chemistry is in good working order...shouldn't you
keep it that way? :)

Hey guys, i know this is completely off the wall... BUT.... I'm hoping there is a super-nerd lurking on this list...  I know there are sum heavy duty unix gurus on this list... maybe there are some other folks that deal with the crap that they call windows...

I'm developing some software for a chemistry lab.  At this lab is a windows 2000 server that runs the lan in the office as well as some more important shit.

Twice the active directory in this server has taken a dump, both times leaving no users with "logon from the network" rights.  A friend of mine found me a fix for this problem, but after applying the fix this time, the server was left in a strange state.

It thinks its just fine, however the only machines that can log into it are other active directory machines.  The server is running in mixed mode and up until yesterday, all of the win98 and NT4 boxes had no problem logging into the server.  After fixing the active directory, they can't.  They can see the domain, but when trying to access it, they say there is either no domain controller or the uber cryptic "the domain controller is not setup for transactions".

Has anybody on this experienced this problem?  If not, does anybody on here have any familiarity with the legacy networking in win2k? Could this be a problem in the repaired group policy template or is it completely unrelated?

[and please no cracks from the peanut gallery about how windows sux... I KNOW DIS]

If anybody knows anything about this problem or where i could go look for answers...please help me :)  

I know its a simple solution and we just need a temporary work around (for a month or so).  If this would involve setting up a temporary backup domain controller for the win2k domain (that doesn't have a hosed active directory) or anything cheesy like that.. I just need something that works :)

keep it wet & hard...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Windows 2000 Problems

In my experience Win 2k's networking sucks, we had nothing but problems at
work and home. In the past few months I have been using XP Professional and
I love it. I think Win 2k is a more stable OS but it has allot of funky
issues. If you can I would rebuild that system using XP professional.

Subject: [sfraves] Live set at n:code/DNA Lounge (12.05.02) Online

Hi....

Well, I didn't get to meet as many new people as I wanted to last week at 
n:code... ;.(

My live mix set is available online. I have no future performances, so this 
might be it for a while. I am down to come support at any event; free party 
and beyond, etc. I just picked up the SPL: Charisma 2 for the studio; 
sounds wicked in series with other gear... Hope to find some time to work 
on tracks soon. My goal is to get a live PA together along with several 
release quality tracks this upcoming year.

You cannot use XP for servers or domain controllers. That would be like
saying, you should rebuild your server with Windows 95! Lol! XP is basically
Win2K Pro with the WinME gui.

Happy  :-)

It is my understanding that in order to use Active Directory correctly, you
cannot be using Win98 or NT4 systems; only 2000... This "Superguru Aaron"
that suppoosedly fixed it for you, did he know that there were NT4 and win98
systems on the network before he did what he did?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Windows 2000 Problems

Can you please give more info? It sounds like you only have 1 domain
controller. That in itself is bad news as you have found out. How many
clients (NT, 98 and/or 2K) are on this domain? You only need to run in mixed
mode if you have NT BDC's, otherwise you can run in native mode. Your
downlevel clients (ie NT and 98) need WINS in order to properly participate
in the domain, which can be run from the domain controllers. Can you remove
the NT clients from the domain and re-add them? You mentioned Group Policy.
What modifications have been made to the Default Group Policy or other GPs?

Happy  :-)

PS Feel free to respond to me off the list.

Not to pick on you specifically, but just WHO exactly is Joe Public?

I think Joe Public has already done ecstacy and knows the difference 
between a dangerous situation and adults having a good time out.

It's this culture of fear that keeps anybody from addressing Joe 
Public with intelligence and reason. It's the most afraid among us 
who do most of the accusing. Don't be afraid.

Use an out of work sys-admin from this list and have them come in for a few
days to set things right. Pay them too. I know several on here really need
the money and know their stuff. (no I'm not a sys-admin or looking for a
job)

You cannot use XP for servers or domain controllers. That would be like
saying, you should rebuild your server with Windows 95! Lol! XP is basically
Win2K Pro with the WinME gui.

you can definitely use active directory and win98 clients, nt4 would follow 
to make sense.

I know of a few out of work NT sysadmins who would love to make some 
extra bank.
Please contact me if you want to get in contact with them.

You cannot use XP for servers or domain controllers. That would be like
saying, you should rebuild your server with Windows 95! Lol! XP is basically
Win2K Pro with the WinME gui.

Actually, you can use NT BDC's with AD, as long as it's still in mixed mode.
One of the AD domain controllers holds the role of PDC emulator. As far as
the BDCs are concerned, they are domain controllers on a NT4 network. This
is an easy way to do an NT to AD migration. Upgrade your PDC to Win2K and
make it the first AD DC. If there is a problem, you can shut down the AD DC
and promote the BDC and be right back where you started.

But would you be using AD to it's fullest by doing this? no, it is a
temporary fix to be used during a migration, and would not be feasable for
extended use...

the thigh bone's connected to the... knee bone!

the knee bone's connected to the...  shin bone!

and that's the way you build it.

ps - you're short a few acronyms, happy.  IIRC, you should always LDAP it
up!  FWIW, RTFM!  TWITA!

Let's say you have a legacy application that uses SQL 7 on NT4, and cannot
use SQL 2000. You can run AD in mixed mode with NT BDCs for the SQL server
to communicate with. To use AD to it's fullest, the clients have to be
running 2K or XP, and these should be using DNS to find the closest copy of
the Global Catalog. Whoof!

As an out-of-work NT super-nerd, I have way too much free time on my hands,
as shown by the amount of energy I've put into this thread! Lol!

You know, that isn't all that far from the truth. I remember being at spring
Internet World a couple of years ago, and part of Microsoft's Partner
Pavillion was Raveworld.net.  They're gone now, right? Serves 'em right for
teaming up with Satan.  :P

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Re: NRR: Windows 2000 Problems

IMHO Happy is technically sound on that advice, although if you were that 
close to having a BDC in place that is an NT4.0 box that could log in, you 
probably would not be in the position you are (maybe not??).  To say the 
least, getting a box into that state will take some time, and validating it 
into the domain which currently does not appear to be authenticating in 
mixed mode will most likely complicate the issue (by not authenticating  
which is your current condition).

I would look to what caused the problem to begin with.  Start with the date 
and time at which your problem developed.  Do some old fashioned sleuthing 
in the event logs and look to the NTDS log files for service layer 
interruptions.  You have listed a key word Transaction in your error 
message that would point to DTC as nothing else really uses the transaction 
method of session negotiation. You might be correct in your group pol 
assumptions but it seems like the symptom you describe where your logons no 
longer authenticate is at fault, not the AD implementation itself.  There 
are AD command line tools available from the MS KB that may help to identify 
the authentication problem but you would have to run them on the NT box and 
that may not generate the appropriate error.  This is probably an 
authentication issue, probably linked to directory service permissions.  
Since all user account, groups, network shares and objects are treated as AD 
server objects, you need to look deeper as to why authentication is not 
taking place.  Start by tracing the Event IDs from event logger and then 
address each one from the time of conflict.

Lastly, Service Pack 3 makes many corrections to the Active Directory 
manager that may be at fault currently.  At least bring your service packs 
up to date and then start to sleuth.  Just my $2.50.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Just too many words from Geri Duhl

 
Yeah!  I think Geri Dahl should be prevented from posting more than twice a 
week. She takes NRR posting to new highs (lows). I even tried emailing her 
privately telling her to "Shut Up".  I remember once she posted to tell 
people to drive safe.
 But ignorance is bliss and the deep and insightful posting continues. I 
don't even open stuff she posts anymore. It's like to stream of 
consciousness, free form writing. That's great if this was a creative writing 
chat group..or a "say what ever is on your mind always" list. I am finally 
going to have to use a filter. 
 Worst thing is it won't end and even a post like this will just bounce of 
that cheery thick skull as if it was the minority opinion.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Just too many words from Geri Duhl

I thought SF Raves was much more of a community where people could come
and share ideas.  I see other people posting poems.  Lots of people post
political stuff.  I think there needs to be a little more art coming
through as well.  When I'm in a bad mood or have the time I love reading
Geri's posts because they don't make much sense sometimes.  Reminds me
that things don't have to all the time.  Then I smile, close the email
and get back to work.

If this is just a list where we're supposed to talk about raves, clubs
and music... Then almost everyone is guilty of breaking the "rules."
Relax... Its just a party ;)

Yeah!  I think Geri Dahl should be prevented from posting more than
twice a 
week. She takes NRR posting to new highs (lows). I even tried emailing
her 
privately telling her to "Shut Up".  I remember once she posted to tell 
people to drive safe.
 But ignorance is bliss and the deep and insightful posting continues. I

don't even open stuff she posts anymore. It's like to stream of 
consciousness, free form writing. That's great if this was a creative
writing 
chat group..or a "say what ever is on your mind always" list. I am
finally 
going to have to use a filter. 
 Worst thing is it won't end and even a post like this will just bounce
of 
that cheery thick skull as if it was the minority opinion.

I'd love to be able to genuinely share your opinion, Rayn.

While it is nice to see that someone is getting something positive out of
this chickie(?)... for the rest of us, really, it's just one long, endless
string of drivel, interspersed with her newfound bile about people who are
awful, dirty hippies because they don't share her taste in long-winded
babblefests about the best place to pick up glitter.

I mean, what the fuck.

I knew a girl a lot like Geri once, actually.

She was the one who informed me that Eminem fought in Oakland gang wars,
that she helped manage the Cannabis Club, and half the bay area owed her
millions of dollars for underground raves she had thrown.

She was also, in case you didn't pick up on it, bugfuck wazoo.

Come to think about it...

I hope that isn't you, Geri. ^_^

Geri is in a unique position that while she doesn't really break any
rules, she still manages to bother some of you folks.

I'll admit her posts come from some other planet, but if you don't want to
read them, then...don't read them! Problem solved.

Subject: [sfraves] thank god i'm back on the list


i just wanted to say that this is really sweet.  Thanks Geri dahl, keep 
saying what you want, everybody else, keep saying what you want, please all 
of you just remember what is important in your lives....
there is a lot more to life than SFR.  I love this list and the experiences 
that I have gone thru for over 6 years now.  But keep yer eye on the ball, 
SFR is not the ball and to get into dramatic things talking shit about 
somebody online is really not what life is all about.  Im sure the Dali Lama 
would even vouch for that.  Unless somebody directly did something to you to 
offend you there really is no reason to get worked up.  If that is the case, 
pleas write a personal letter to yer fellow who you are troubling with and 
work out yer scnarios on your own personal time, not SFR's.
with love and respect,
danny

Geri dahl, if she truly exists, is unique. She's a part of the list that 
definitely brings some interesting ideas and comments to the table. I 
can't really diss on her for being who she wants to be, and saying 
whatever she feels is right at the time.
I can't necessarily say anything bad, nor good about her. I've never met 
her, and I don't know anyone who's actually met her. She definitely 
seems like one of those people who you could get really stoned and just 
talk philosophy for hours with. I know I'd enjoy it.
Then again, I'm evil. Crazy people and evil people run together. It's 
just a given :)

Subject: [sfraves] waffle therapy nrr

Every now and then a pretty bird comes down from the sky and taps me on 
the shoulder "oh-so" eloquently. Whatever I did to attract it's 
attention is unknown (other than the fact that my bright orange 
sweatshirt might have something to do with that, or that I was 
particularly shining the day that such events occur). I believe that 
granola could have possibly been put on this Earth just for me 
sometimes, especially when mixed with raspberries and a nice 
coconut-white cup of plain yogurt. : ) MMMmm. It reminds me of the time 
that I was reading a book and these clouds rolled by and covered up 
everything that I had been putting so much of my energy into that day. 
Even the clouds were against me! Without asking, they swooped down and 
rained on my parade that I had been trying so hard to keep afloat. But 
of course -- when someone offers me a drink, whether it be lemonade or 
green tea -- I am normally never one to turn such a unique opportunity 
down, especially when I am in a position that I find myself in quite 
often, especially nowadays when things seem so glum and 
uncircumstantial and there is but a tiny glimmer of belation to be 
found on a sunday when there is the smell of fresh biscuit permeating 
from the kitchen. Or even the bedrooom for that matter! :D Happiness is 
rarely found when going by the book so often-time evidence leads you to 
believe that without finding yourself there is no such thing, but who 
needs myself, i can find it just find by twittering myself into the 
tanning salon and mounting the uv-bar like how lassie saved the boy who 
fell off his bike in that one episode of nick-at-night.

i'm sorry if you don't like what your reading, perhaps what i wrote was 
not meant for your eyes, but happened to find itself there. I plan on 
posting one of these non-sequiter poo letters every day until the day 
that my fingers fall off or I can no longer find the means of using the 
internet. I am quite confident that I will build up a following of 
rejects that enjoy my posts because somehow in my ramblings it makes 
their lives not seem so lonely in a Heaven's Gate'ish fashion.

down with censorship!

RAVE CRACKDOWN RESULTS IN HOLLYWOOD NIGHTCLUB RAID, DRUG ARRESTS

LOS ANGELES -( AP )- A seven-month probe that led to the seizure of more
than 10,000 Ecstasy pills culminated in a raid early Sunday at a popular
Hollywood nightclub where authorities allege designer drugs were openly
sold at rave parties.

Five people were arrested on drug charges during the raid of Circus Disco,
capping an undercover investigation by the U.S.  Drug Enforcement Agency
and the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.

During that time, alcohol control investigators bought Ecstasy, cocaine,
marijuana and ketamine from 25 people.  In six cases, the drug sales were
either made or facilitated by nightclub employees, the state's alcohol
control department said in a statement.

The pills that were seized over the course of the investigation had an
estimated street value of more than $200,000, officials said.

No one at the club was available for comment Sunday night.

Investigators targeted Circus Disco following the September 2001 death of
a 27-year-old man who collapsed on the dance floor and began having
convulsions after taking Ecstasy he allegedly obtained at the nightclub.

The man's parents have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the club's
owner, Eugene LaPietra, who spearheaded an unsuccessful ballot measure to
have Hollywood secede from the city of Los Angeles.

State officials said they had consulted one of the nation's leading
experts on Ecstasy and raves.  After visiting Circus Disco, the expert,
Trinka D.  Porrrata, said the club was clearly hosting raves based on
factors ranging from the sale of caffeinated "power" drinks that
supposedly enhance Ecstasy's hallucination-inducing effects to the loud
music and the presence of a "cooling off" area staffed by emergency
medical technicians.

Although the club remained open Sunday night, the state Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control plans to accuse Circus Disco with violating the
terms of its liquor license for allowing "the conspicuous and blatant use
of drugs," the agency said in a statement.  The action could result in the
club having its license to sell liquor suspended.

Subject: [sfraves] Words for Mormon boy & too many words from Geri Duhl (heres a good thread)


In a message dated 12/10/02 7:55:21 PM, josephwhunt@hotmail.com writes:

<< Wow, the "Elite Ravers" are passing judgements on the impartial.  What a

 Hey Trendy Mormon Boy,

 There is a difference between "passing judgment" and "critical analysis." 
Passing judgment sounds like a religious term that someone from....never 
mind. Long live Utah and polygamy. 
 Elite ravers passing judgment are 20 years olds who think they are the shit 
because they've been to every Imagine party and helped make decorations. They 
have a custom Imagine outfit or hat or fleece and wear it almost every time 
you see them out. Did that custom fleece come from Imagine charity proceeds 
or did the crew spring for those out of their own pocket???
 Please note that loving Geri doesn't need to include supporting the 5 posts 
a day about the cute boy, and tea, and what is on TV, and quoting Bush 
straight off of CNN and whatever else sticks in her head long enough for her 
to type it.
 The only thing worse on this list last couple weeks was Mr. Sholin (DJ 
Septer) posting about the "incredible 2x4 with VETERAN Paul the Fan Man" in 
Sac's most unique line up ever.
 Real love is about telling someone the truth, hypefree. Not some candy 
coated fluffy version of what you wanted to say but were afraid to lay on the 
table. Real love is taking the risk, even if it means risking defender 
flames, to say it like it is "Hey lady could you chill on posting everything 
that you think we all need to read". Real love is saying "Shut the fuck up" 
with compassion. That is not elite. Nor harsh.
 It is just that those post are unique and witty and bizarre and slightly 
developmentally disabled when read a few times. But as the frequency 
increases so the cuteness fades and it is just plain obnoxious.
 We love you Geri! For all that you are. I personally would love you more if 
you read more and typed less. Here, here to that. Can I get an amen?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Just too many words from Geri Duhl

So here's what I don't get...

You start out complaining about "geri dahl", suggesting that she/he/it/whatever
be restircted to a tiny number of posts per week.

Then you go on to say the (s)he is deep and insightful.  (S)he is neither.  You
obviously share the opinion, otherwist you wouldn't be calling for the
restriction.

Finally, you make it to the obvious solution: a filter.  So why didn't you just
go straight to filtering in the first place?  It's not as if the "geri dahl"
posts are commercial spam, by any streach of the imagination.  So, if they
bother you, why *NOT* just filter?

Myself, I read in digest mode, and see the thread topics at the top of each. 
So I usually just page down through any threads started by him/her/it/whatever.
 But really... just HOW often does a "will 'geri dahl' please shut up" thread
come up?


cya,
john

Yeah!  I think Geri Dahl should be prevented from posting more than
twice a 
week. She takes NRR posting to new highs (lows). I even tried emailing
her 
privately telling her to "Shut Up".  I remember once she posted to tell 
people to drive safe.
 But ignorance is bliss and the deep and insightful posting continues. I

don't even open stuff she posts anymore. It's like to stream of 
consciousness, free form writing. That's great if this was a creative
writing 
chat group..or a "say what ever is on your mind always" list. I am
finally 
going to have to use a filter. 
 Worst thing is it won't end and even a post like this will just bounce
of 
that cheery thick skull as if it was the minority opinion.

I disagree.

I'm fairly sure that Geri Dahl is some kind of commercial advertisement
for a dangerous and horrible psychoactive that induces complete,
irrevocable schizophrenia.

And I'm tired of being spammed. :P

That was just the "passing judgment" that TMB was prolly talking about.
So far as I've seen, he hasn't advocated either of the two.

The thing that strikes me about the rave community is that the word "love"
flows so freely nobody knows what it means anymore.  Granted, it's all
subjective, but can anybody "Really Love" Geri Dahl from her posts alone?
Real Love often involves more than just posts to a list.

No, you can't.  This is a public list, and Geri Dahl can post as much or
as little as she wants until she's moderated by someone that controls the
subscriptions to the list.

That's the one thing that seems to escape minds like yours - you can bitch
as much as you like, but whomever it is that you're bitching at can choose
to ignore you and go about their merry business - amazing as it may seem,
your views are not absolute.

I've seen the AOL mail client - it has a delete button, and it also has a
field for "From:" using them in combination might be a good idea in the
future when you see posts from people that you don't like to read.

Subject: [sfraves] [NRR] "Club Drugs"

Well fuck it, if others can ramble, so can I.  :P

So I amble into the elevator at work this morning, and there are a couple of
8.5x11 sheets taped onto the walls that simply say "CLUB DRUGS" with the
location of whatever this is (in the lobby, to the right, blah blah blah).
I joked around with the folks around me, "Club drugs? What, are they for
sale? Are they giving them away? Ecstacy? Ketamine? GHB? Hook a brotha up."
Mind you, I work in one of those highrise office buildings, so this is the
oddest place to see a flyer like this... And probably an odd place to rattle
off the names of various psychotropics in the presence of people in suits &
ties.

Then I remember that a month or two ago, a similar flyer had been posted in
our elevators about "marijuana addiction."  Looks like our building has its
very own Mr. Garrison. Drugs are bad, mmmmm'kay? I keep looking down the
hallway for a balding closet case with a hand puppet, but to no avail.

I snicker about this until I'm mentally halted by the thought that this is
probably a small part of that bigger picture of the recent (or rather,
ongoing) Fear and Loathing that's been spread about to distract us from the
real issues. Instead of worrying about how we're financially in shambles and
that we're trying to remedy it by blowing up or exploiting any brown-skinned
folks we can find, we're being reminded that our biggest fear is that one of
our own might be dancing to the blipping and beeping of electronic music
while getting intoxicated in some legally sanctioned space that probably
gives a good back to the economy by means of liquor licenses, permits, and
taxes.

Anyway, thinking about this makes my head hurt, and I've got to coordinate
an international release of some really shitty, buggy software so I can keep
my job so I can make this pittance so I can keep paying for the steep cover
charges and drinks at these scandalous clubs where all these drugs are being
abused.  In the meantime, I think I'll track down Mr. Garrison on my break
and give him a piece of my half-rotten-from-clubbing mind.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Just too many words from Geri Duhl

correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't one of the functions of a "moderator," at 
least in theory, to "moderate" when, e.g., a list member engages in hate 
speech?  i quote from Ms. Dahl's latest controversial missive:

"scummy, stinky, sweaty, oily dank smoking acid trippy ugly hippy girls only 
party. someone get on it quick, because i can tell you for sure that there 
are enough followers of that life plan to keep you in business for life if 
your into it...hey, i hear some of these kinds of people even get laid and 
occasionally remember it."

substitute the name of an ethnic or religious group--or, perhaps, the name 
of YOUR favorite sub-set of the dance-music scene!--for "hippy" in the 
preceding quote, post it under a name other than that of She Who Must Be 
Indulged, and just watch the fucking fur fly, no?

i decided to grow my hair longer than the typical American male when i was 
14 years old.  i've been taking shit from ignorant, closed-minded little 
people ever since.  i will be forty-six years old on Monday, and i am sick 
and fucking tired of this shit.  i don't give a damn what Geri Dahl's 
personal foibles or problems are, and i really don't care about her more 
typical illiterate, self-absorbed drivel; in fact, if other people hadn't 
copied her verbiage into her replies, i'd never even have seen it, since i 
filtered that daft bitch MONTHS ago. but when her bullshit gets incorporated 
into a thread, i can't avoid it, since i at least scan posts that i don't 
filter.  and she has NO right WHATSOVER to post this kind of hateful, 
ignorant drivel.  perhaps our "moderator" should stand down in favor of 
someone who actually takes the responsibilities of the position seriously, 
rather than saying in essence "it's not a problem unless you give a shit."  
or just answer the simple question: is it acceptable for ANYONE to engage in 
hate speech against WHOEVER they're stupidly prejudiced against?  or is that 
right accreted only to Ms. Dahl, and is hatred allowed only against 
"hippies"?  i'll take my answer on the air...

Many are quite funny. So, its funny because we our the group poking fun

I don't tell people I'm a "RAVER" 100%, its just what I do occasionally.
I don't mind hearing raver jokes because stereotypes are always grounded

Thanks for the news, Apollo, however sad it was to read. Stereolab's one of
those bands that I've always loved but had a tough time explaining to
people, lest I sat them down and forced them to listen to at least half an
album to appreciate.  Now I *really* regret missing their last show at the
Fillmore.  RIP...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Just too many words from Geri Duhl

They don't? ;)  Totally agree with you though.  I'm so sick of
political-correctness and hurt feelings.  Sure there are some major
underlying issues behind socital problems but at the same time we're
using scare tactics, court cases and new laws to go about it instead of
the cost-inefficient process of edumacation.

Bob,

I'm white and in a lot of countries I would be ridiculed, spit on,
robbed etc. because of it.  Hell, I'm even of Irish descent.  Yet all
irishman jokes are typically accepted as funny and I don't know many
people who get too butt-hurt over it... (Note:  We are not all cops
named Murphy and live in boston) And if I were to be angry at someone of
another nationality making fun of my heritage I would most likely be
branded the racist as well since I'm white and jokes about us don't
matter since we've never been opressed.  That's why Belfast is still a
warzone, Spanish people are no longer white, and most of the original
settlers of the US were slaughtered by native tribes until
reinforcements arrived. (Not that I condone what we did to them after
that in the slightest.)  I've very proud to be of Irish descent but I'm
not overly serious about it... Hell, we created Guinness ;)

To keep going on I was born mormon, but its by general consensus its ok
to say things like 'Oh, its ok to make fun of mormons about polygamy,
their undergarments etc. because its funny and they don't seem to mind.'
I'll tell you that most mormon's are very jovial people and able to
laugh at their own weird ways.  It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt though
as a kid to be picked on about how weird you are for the LDS religions
past of multiple wives.  The constant hasseling of, whats wrong with
you, you guys don't drink, don't smoke, don't (shouldn't) drink caffeine
or even tea, you dress weird, you don't swear, etc.  Instead of calling
that person an insult or claiming they need to be moderated they'll lead
by example and still be a good person to you and try to educate you
about why they are the way they are, typically and mostly outside of
Utah.  Up until the late 1980's or 90's it was still legal to slay a
mormon in Missouri due to the opression they got in the 1800s.  

I had long hair for 5 years in the heart of mormon country.  The only
time I got picked on about it was when jobs wanted me to look
professional.  I got called hippy, I still do get called hippy even
though I have short hair and don't really fit the dress.  Did I ever
care?  Not really.  They got a lot of political movements going that
didn't exist before, but their lifestyle was far too radical for people
to understand, and they didn't do a good job of explaining and educating
people of why they do what they do.  Soon they were seen as people who
protested for any reason and they got old quick and people stopped
listening to the commonly dirty, drugged up, free love person because
they started grating on peoples nerves.  People like to be able to
express opinions without being ripped into, sometimes its derogatory
because they are uneducated on your way of life.  And if they are
educated about it then they probably have an opposing viewpoint and you
either work through it or don't associate with that person.  If someone
makes a comment about your lifestyle that you don't agree with, explain
to them your point of view.  If they refuse to listen, refuse to
associate with them.  It doesn't mean that other people don't like them
though.

There is a huge difference between racism and lifestyle though.  A
lifestyle is something you most likely choose or are raised in but you
always have the option to change if you don't like it, or you should be
proud of it and realize that there will be people out there who don't
agree with you.  (I'm not going into family guilt factors for sake of
length) You can either get over it or be bitter.  You can't choose the
color of your skin though.. Well, Michael Jackson prooved us wrong there
but I don't think people will be following his lead since his
expieriment seemed to fail and his nose eventually fell off...  But when
you're persecuted for something you can't change, its these things that
should be looked at and dealt with because your skin color doesn't
determine whats in your head.  And the man will try to make you believe
that because you are different, you are not as good as them.  Its
because they're scared.  Frightened.  And also uneducated or raised to
believe a certain way.  If you can for one second not snap back at them
and try to get them to listen and change their view point a little, it's
the road to their recovery.  Or you might find out that they were
traumatised by something and the only thing they remember is a skin
color, or a drugged out look in the eyes, or the persons sex and they
reject anything relating to it from then on out until they seek help.
If you don't want to deal with them, don't.  Geri obviously didn't piss
off everyone on the list with her hippy comment.  You should respond to
her in private and ask her why she thinks as such or shrug it off.  If
we were to ban everyone who made a comment without thinking first of
anothers feelings, we'd have no leaders of our country, no military, no
philsophers, and definitely no artists or musicians.

We are all different, we are all unique and we all have the most complex
computer and operating system known to man built into our head.
Unfortunately, its easier to use it to hurt and defend than it is to
accept new data or explain yourself without striking back and fueling
the fire.  If you don't take the brief effort to see where someone else
is coming from, you don't have a starting point yourself and come off
sounding as ignorant as they.

Of course I'm also forgiving and accepting to a fault.  Fool me once,
whatever.  Fool me twice, whatever.  Fool me again, avoidance.
Apologize, welcome back.  My problem is I typically consider everyones
point of view and usually never talk because I'm always analzying
incoming data and can't translate my opinions to speech fast enough.

-Rayn

correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't one of the functions of a
"moderator," at 
least in theory, to "moderate" when, e.g., a list member engages in hate

speech?  i quote from Ms. Dahl's latest controversial missive:

"scummy, stinky, sweaty, oily dank smoking acid trippy ugly hippy girls
only 
party. someone get on it quick, because i can tell you for sure that
there 
are enough followers of that life plan to keep you in business for life
if 
your into it...hey, i hear some of these kinds of people even get laid
and 
occasionally remember it."

substitute the name of an ethnic or religious group--or, perhaps, the
name 
of YOUR favorite sub-set of the dance-music scene!--for "hippy" in the 
preceding quote, post it under a name other than that of She Who Must Be

Indulged, and just watch the fucking fur fly, no?

i decided to grow my hair longer than the typical American male when i
was 
14 years old.  i've been taking shit from ignorant, closed-minded little

people ever since.  i will be forty-six years old on Monday, and i am
sick 
and fucking tired of this shit.  i don't give a damn what Geri Dahl's 
personal foibles or problems are, and i really don't care about her more

typical illiterate, self-absorbed drivel; in fact, if other people
hadn't 
copied her verbiage into her replies, i'd never even have seen it, since
i 
filtered that daft bitch MONTHS ago. but when her bullshit gets
incorporated 
into a thread, i can't avoid it, since i at least scan posts that i
don't 
filter.  and she has NO right WHATSOVER to post this kind of hateful, 
ignorant drivel.  perhaps our "moderator" should stand down in favor of 
someone who actually takes the responsibilities of the position
seriously, 
rather than saying in essence "it's not a problem unless you give a
shit."  
or just answer the simple question: is it acceptable for ANYONE to
engage in 
hate speech against WHOEVER they're stupidly prejudiced against?  or is
that 
right accreted only to Ms. Dahl, and is hatred allowed only against 
"hippies"?  i'll take my answer on the air...

Howlin' Bob,

Of course hate speech is discouraged on this list. However, I fail to see
Geri's posts as hate speech. You take a single excerpt with an off-color
remark and ask me to step down because I don't adopt a harsh stance? I
think it would be a diservice to the list to walk on egg shells
and be reactive to anything that someone on the list might find offensive.
This isn't an AOL list. This isn't a public high school where they ban a
novel because it has the word nigger in it.

One of the reasons SFR has been allowed to prosper is because
of its hands-off moderation policy. Freedom of speech is key to this list.
Personally, I draw the line at those who blatantly abuse the list or attack
others on it. Currently, I don't believe Geri falls into either category.

Anyone and everyone here has always been welcome too send me their
complaints and suggestions, and many have. Contrary to your belief, Bob, I
do take my role here very seriously, and spend a lot of my day keeping up
with traffic and performing list admin duties. However, as your public
servant, if enough of you believe SFR needs to crack out the whip, I will
oblidge or find someone who can.

take care,

terry

way to seriously. I don't get offend that Geri sends out her emails, I just

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Just too many words from Geri Duhl

Wow..I didn't read all the posts, nor did I read what Geri said.. My take on
it ( The views I expressed years ago and was scornfully told to shut my
mouth ) Geri has never had anything positive to contribute to this list. Her
post was extremely offensive to many people that belong to this list.
"scummy, stinky, sweaty, oily dank smoking acid trippy ugly hippy girls"
"hey, I hear some of these kinds of people even get laid and occasionally
remember it." What the fuck is that all about, and you know what I hear Geri
you actually remember some of what you learned in second grade right before
you dropped out.
Geri, you are a hateful annoying ignorant waste of matter. Any person who
hates on any other person because of the lifestyle the choose to live is
ignorant. Do you GERI even know what Hippies believe in? Have you once tried
to educate yourself in their culture? To me you are equivalent to a racist,
you should post how you think Africans are "scummy, stinky, sweaty, oily"
I'm sorry but I can not tolerate ignorance. I think you Geri would be better
off joining the Nazi mailing list...Just my two pesos.

Boys, boys.

As much as anyone, I 
a) support free speech but also 
b) wish Geri would move to Nebraska, or suffer a
sudden and total loss of internet access.

But I like both of you.

Can't we all just get along?  ;-P

ps. maybe we need a new subject-line acronym (NRR
/ GDB) for those posts which reply to, or
continue, a Geri Dahl thread.  The last word in
this acronym, of course, being 'bullshit.'

pps. as a past ponytail-wearer, perhaps the
correct response is just a torrent of flames from
past and present hippies to geri regarding the
distastefulness of glitter makeup, and her snotty
little attitude regarding same.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: FS - 2 21" computer monitors

Hey all,

I want to get rid of my 2 21" CRT computer monitors (replacing with
flat-panels).  Anyone need a nice display?

#1 is Optiquest (Viewsonic OEM) Q115 : .26 pitch, 1600x1200x76Hz.  This is a
great monitor and has been on my desk for about a year.  It's a gorgeous
display.  These sell new for about $550 + shipping.

#2 is a Sun 21" display.  It is not the trinitron, but the next model down.
It is vertically flat and gorgeous.  I'm pretty sure it is a .26, and I know
it can do 1600x1200x80Hz.  The trinitron is selling for $1000, so I'd guess
this is somewhere around $600 new.

I'll best offer on these, but let's not get silly - I'm not letting them go
for $100. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Just too many words from Geri Duhl


I'm not mad about one extremely stupid post from Julie.

There's nothing about SFR thgat mandates reason, and to be honest people
have been making occasional fun of hippies, tranceheads, e-tards,a dn
sarcastic techno djs and other inherent demographics.

That's not the problem.

The problem is someone who consistently tests the rules of this while at a
complete 180 to the spirit of what it's about (discussing raves and rave
culture in and around SF).

How many more almost exclusively off topic mails until it's a problem?

I recommend she be asked by the moderator (with list support) to police
herself (at least 50% on topic posts or something), and should that fail
we boot her.

We're talking several messages a week, to hundreds of recipients, for
years now... with only an extremely small fraction even pretending to be
along the lines of what most of us signed up for.

If Julie doesn't know where this type of writing belongs... do we have to
shoulder the brunt of it?  Usenet, personal web page, livejournal, etc.
SFRaves is NOT the place for the personal ramblings that have nothing to
do with the scene.  Of course we all do this from time to time, but she's
made a habit out of it that wastes everybody else's time.

Subject: [sfraves] How a community treats its wackos

Why shouldn't we tolerate a community's harmless wackos? Especially 
when they really aren't doing any harm? Is an online community that 
different than a real one?

"Banish them" is not the answer.

It's a topic centric discussion list.

The "community aspect" of SFR is not just this list (but the only part
Julie participates in).  It's also going out to events, being there,
meeting others from the list, offline communications, etc... not talking
about yourself incessantly on a mailing list that has nothing to do.

If I showed up on a linux newsgroup talking about nothing but bee pollen,
you better believe they're gonna kick me the fuck off.  I don't understand
why rules of courtesy in regards to topic and respect shouldn't apply
here.

I keep hoping that she's just tuned into a different frequency than the rest
of us. Then I could just look at it as a peek into something that I don't
understand. I remember someone trying to read into her posts and saying how
they have hidden meaning that we just don't/can't see. Something like that.

I saw a flying pig once.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] How a community treats its wackos

I'll throw my long, rambling, semi-coherent hat in the ring. :P

Don't recall who originally said this, but:

>> If I showed up on a linux newsgroup talking about nothing but bee pollen,
>> you better believe they're gonna kick me the fuck off.  I don't understand
>> why rules of courtesy in regards to topic and respect shouldn't apply
>> here.

I'm in the "if you don't like it, just delete it" camp, as that's generally
what I do. I treat it like the 100+ pieces of spam I receive at work each
day and send the GDB (look, I'm already using the acronym!) on its merry
way.

However, I'm also inclined to agree with the Linux/bee pollen analogy. The
difference comes from one single, solitary letter.  You see, the list is
called SFRaves. Meaning the main topic at hand is raves (or anything related
to them, which so often turns out to be music, DJ/raver culture, and
society/law).  At least, that's what I take it to be, so I think everyone's
complaints are valid.

Had one letter been added to the domain name - say it was "sfraveRs.org,"
then no one would have much to complain about. Because then, well, GD as a
purported raver could post her inane ramblings all she wanted, because it
would be about an SF-area raver - namely, herself.

So if we want to get this nit-picky about it (which I'm assuming people are,
otherwise they wouldn't be posting constantly) and want to whine about
everything to a moderator, there first need to be defined lines. At what
point is something NRR *too* NRR for SFRaves? Who's to decide that? Who's to
judge what's too NRR too often?  Geri's self-absorbed analyses of hair
products? Sameer's right-wing rants against war protesters? Osby's
oh-my-gosh declarations about the cookies he just baked? Screw it! Let's
make all NRR posts illegal, or at best, limited to once a week.  *grin*

Wait, wait, wait... Hold it!! We couldn't have the same SFR without these
little entertainments that arrive in our inboxes everyday, could we? Sure,
there'd be plenty of rave-related info, and the list would be a dynamic
version of the calendar. Are we sure that's what we want? Because if we
condemn one individual's off-topic ramblings, why should anyone else be
entitled to do so, even if it was less often?

The bottom line is, a good number of us clog some of the bandwidth here with
utterly Non-Rave-Related crap, myself included. Some more often than others.
Although those things are way off topic and often waste our time, and sure
as shit a number of them bug me, I think we're better for having them. Even
though we all love our community and want to maintain it, we also have to
keep the blemishes, whether they be purveyors of political vitriol or
useless banter. I hate to agree with the overly PLURry people on the list
(you know who you are, you candy-colored dorkoids), but it just wouldn't be
the same community without these, erm, warts. Or however you see them.

What am I saying?  Either put together a movement to establish some strict
rules and have them mercilessly enforced, or kick back, relax, and enjoy
this ever-growing, fucked up, wonderful, dysfunctional virtual family that
we are. Personally, I prefer the latter - less rules and a few annoyances -
rather than the Ashcroft-inspired less-freedom-for-more-peace-of-mind trap
;)

Well, that's my two-and-a-half cents. (Inflation, ya know.)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] How a community treats its wackos

Unfortunately, our constitutional rights do apply to this list.  Geri, as
whack as she may be, does have the right to say what's on her twisted little
mind.  Although I am not personally fond of Geri because of a lil flame war
she and I got into a few months ago, I do support her in her unique views.
She has the right to share, she has the right to babble.  If you don't want
to read it you are a ctrl+a ~> del away from ALL and any posts pertaining to
her.  Her posts have been described as adding a "hai ku" *sp?* quality to
the list.  I personally call it insane blathering, but I'm not lazy enough,
or grumpy enough, to let her 3 posts a week get to me or make ME START
emphasizing every OTHER word IN CAPS cuz I'm SO mad about GERI filling MY
inbox with shiat. (!)  If you let the idiot get to you, the idiot will one
day rule the town.  Chill out ya'll.  Do what I do and make ample use of
your delete key...It works wonders =)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] How a community treats its wackos

Constitution has nothing to do with this list. It's a privately owned list
which is operated on a privately owned server. Constitution doesn't apply.
Any private forum such as SFR is subject to the rules of the forum. The
consitution provides for the right to have a server hosting a list like SFR,
but doesn't guarantee the subscribers the right to say whatever they want.
The list is setup as a forum, a very open forum, and has a moderator which
can step in and censor at any time. Be glad that this list is as such. I may
not like hearing all the random thoughts from Julie but it's nice to know
that I can dump like that should I choose to. It's a privilege, not a
right...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] How a community treats its wackos


Unfortunately, our constitutional rights do apply to this list.  Geri, as
whack as she may be, does have the right to say what's on her twisted little
mind.  Although I am not personally fond of Geri because of a lil flame war
she and I got into a few months ago, I do support her in her unique views.
She has the right to share, she has the right to babble.  If you don't want
to read it you are a ctrl+a ~> del away from ALL and any posts pertaining to
her.  Her posts have been described as adding a "hai ku" *sp?* quality to
the list.  I personally call it insane blathering, but I'm not lazy enough,
or grumpy enough, to let her 3 posts a week get to me or make ME START
emphasizing every OTHER word IN CAPS cuz I'm SO mad about GERI filling MY
inbox with shiat. (!)  If you let the idiot get to you, the idiot will one
day rule the town.  Chill out ya'll.  Do what I do and make ample use of
your delete key...It works wonders =)

There's nothing about SFR thgat mandates reason, and to be honest people

That's not the problem.

The problem is someone who consistently tests the rules of this while at a

culture in and around SF).

How many more almost exclusively off topic mails until it's a problem?

I recommend she be asked by the moderator (with list support) to police
herself (at least 50% on topic posts or something), and should that fail
we boot her.

We're talking several messages a week, to hundreds of recipients, for
years now... with only an extremely small fraction even pretending to be
along the lines of what most of us signed up for.

If Julie doesn't know where this type of writing belongs... do we have to
shoulder the brunt of it?  Usenet, personal web page, livejournal, etc.
SFRaves is NOT the place for the personal ramblings that have nothing to
do with the scene.  Of course we all do this from time to time, but she's
made a habit out of it that wastes everybody else's time.

 Chirs Jackson post are funny, coherant and usually based on music and music

Geri dilutes this list with all the time. Chris Jackson has dry bite to his

Council deputizes pot club founders
By DAN WHITE
Santa Cruz Sentinel (CA) staff writer

SANTA CRUZ - The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to deputize
the co-founders of a medical-marijuana club, symbolically making them
officers of the city government.

That doesn't mean Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana's Mike and
Valerie Corral are actual deputies, have any special powers or will
"need to show any stinkin' badges," said City Councilman Tim
Fitzmaurice. Instead, their status means the council officially
sanctions WAMM's activities.

Council members said they hope the formal link between the city and
the group will increase legal protections for the Corrals, who have
not been charged with a crime in connection with a September raid by
federal agents on their pot farm, but are wary of future prosecution.

The Corrals are still trying to get the seized marijuana plants and
some equipment back from the federal government.

At the very least, the deputization shows solidarity with WAMM,
council members said.

Armed federal agents arrested the Corrals on Sept. 5 and tore out 167
plants at their Davenport-area marijuana garden. The Corrals, who
were released hours after their arrest, said they were told they
could be arrested again at any time.

WAMM's founders say most of the group's 200-plus members are
seriously or terminally ill.

Council members received national media attention later in September
for showing up to a rally on the steps of City Hall, where WAMM
members came to get their weekly allotment of medical pot. For their
stand, council members were alternately praised as heroes standing up
against federal bullies, and ridiculed as flakes who were
perpetuating the city's wacky, drugged-out image.

If the WAMM founders end up before the Supreme Court, "we're showing
faith in what they are doing," Councilman Tim Fitzmaurice said. He
said WAMM could turn to the court and say, "Look, this is the faith
the community has in us."

Andrea Tischler of the local Compassion Flower Inn, a
bed-and-breakfast devoted to medical marijuana, urged the city to
take it a step further and "consider deputizing others to run clubs
because over 2,000 patients are in need of their medicine" in Santa
Cruz County. She said there's no way WAMM alone can serve the need.

Councilman Mike Rotkin said he's concerned that the national press is
making the city's stand on medical marijuana into an
everybody-must-get-stoned story.

He said city leaders did not take the deputization status lightly,
and that it was extending this status because of WAMM's continued
commitment to protecting terminally ill patients. He said that for
anyone else to get this deputy status, they'd have to prove they had
as much commitment and responsibility as WAMM.

Councilman Mark Primack supported the motion but said he wanted to do
something that had more "teeth" to provide guaranteed legal
protections for the Corrals. He said he was dismayed by a recent
statement by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration that
deputization would not change the Corrals' status in the eyes of the
government.

"What is a tangible action to create real protection?" he said.

Rotkin replied that he thought DEA spokesman Richard Meyer was being
"very disingenuous" in his statements to the Sentinel earlier this
week, and that deputization could offer real protections.

"This could be a way to defend them because they are following the
spirit of the local (medical marijuana) ordinance and should not be
prosecuted," Rotkin said. "In the end, it's not up to the DEA but the
courts to settle this."

Meyer on Tuesday reiterated his statement that "federal law
supersedes state or local law, so nobody in the U.S. has
authorization to distribute illegal drugs at will. We are a country
of laws. Deputization really does nothing as far as federal law is
concerned."

The federal government considers medical marijuana contraband and has
asserted that its authority overrides state and local laws that make
provisions for medical marijuana - touching off an emotional debate
about alternative medicine, drug use and local authority.

The Corrals said Tuesday they hoped their new status would give them
protection under the same federal law that lets police officers
legally carry and sell drugs while engaging in narcotics stings.
According to this reading of the law, the Corrals would be
"enforcing" state and local laws allowing for medical marijuana use.

"It's opposite ends of the same continuum," Mike Corral said.
"They're out to bust people and we're out to help."

Meyer said he couldn't imagine WAMM meeting the criteria to fall
under the provisions of that federal law.

"That makes no sense," he said. "Local deputies handle drugs, process
them and lock them up. They don't distribute them to people on the
street. If they did that, they would be breaking the law."

Santa Cruz, however, is not the first city to try to use deputization
of medical marijuana club members to increase their protection from
federal prosecution. A similar approach was used in Oakland and San
Francisco. The strategy has yet to be tested in federal court.

WAMM members say they are still getting marijuana for members. They
declined to state the source.

WAMM board member Suzanne Pfeil said the government "tries to
characterize a sick and tiny community as drug trafficking, and that
it has to protect the (community) from us. We ask you to protect us
from them."

You banish Chris Jackson; you might as well say goodbye to me as well. 
Chris's posts are always fun to read...I have stayed out of this topic, but, 
I do have to ask; Where is Geri in all of this ???

I have seen hyde nor haiku form her on this topic. If some were to start a 
"Jack 7RIUMPH sucks" post, you can bet I be throwing grenades by this 
point...I don't think anyone deserves to have this much time spent getting 
hated on. Do I think sometimes her posts go nowhere? sure. But, I also have 
the choice of not reading them.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Just too many words from Geri Duhl

in my experience, every time i have ever commented on Geri in a way that
normal people would be offended (did that make sense?) she has either not
responded at all, or responded with something that leads you to believe that
either she did not read what was originally said, or that she is a robot...

There was this one time that she called me a name in response to my shit
talk... i think she called me a "grumpy old man" or something to that
affect...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] How a community treats its wackos

it has been my understanding for quite some time now
that the letters NRR in the subject line are
designated to allow listees to filter out
non-rave-related posts.

if you don't know how to use your email filters, drop
me a line and i'll help you figure it out if i can. 
besides filtering your email lists you can also reduce
spam.

because of off-topic posts, i've gotten furniture from
fellow sfravers, picked up links to cool websites,
gotten some interesting perspectives with raver flavor
on current events and other hot topics... these are a
few benefits of NRR that i can think of just off the
top of my head.  are we talking about doing away with
NRR?

to suppress something is to give it strength; this has
been the testimony of censorship time and time again. 
there is enough fascism elsewhere, don't you think? 
lest we forget, this whole community is populated with
whackos. just ask the DEA.

;)sooz

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Has anybody ever seen Geri Dahl?

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, and consider that a bad joke..
because it would be sad if people went down to the level of making fun of
the way someone looks. This is kindof reminding me of high school ;)

Comeon guys, can't we go back to bashing politicians and other
people/things that don't have feelings? Or, did that get boring?

You can tell allot about a person by they way the present them self. In
example..Geekey Glasses, funky Hawaiian shirt, tight pants..I think the only
thing she is missing is her fanny pack you could put her in geek status.
Unfortunately for her she isn't very smart so I wouldn't classify her a
geek..I think wacko best describes her..

wack·o   (wk) also whack·o (hwk, wk)
n. Slang pl. wack·os
  A person regarded as eccentric or irrational. See Geri Dahl

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Just too many words from Geri Duhl

Here here.. Very well put as most of all Andy's Posts are..

I agree 100% with his sentement it has been going on for years.. and I can 
count the number of relevant posts to the scene/DJ culture etc on both of my 
hands and that is a shame..

I say we go with that plan.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Has anybody ever seen Geri Dahl?

d00d, did my post not make sense... read the post I made before that one
(stating how whenever I have ever made a comment about Geri she never
responds)... Then re-read the post you just responded to...

AHHH!!! it is all coming together now... Mr. Vincondoa may have some
intelligence after all....

Another give away that I was joking was the nice little "winking smiley
face" at the end of my post... We went over this maybe a year ago with
Shaman (from Blue Green) that the "winking smiley face" is roughly the
equivalent to a "j/k"....

p.s. whatsup with putting your signature in twice? once isn't enough?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Calling All DJs

If you are booked for a party then how come your friend hasn't taken care of
the sound system? That's not a dj's responsibility. In the world of throwing
parties we as promoters take care of all the details including sound, venue,
tickets, water, logistics, and lineup. The dj is paid talent and only needs
to show up with a record case.

It seems that your friend doesn't know what they're doing if you're having
to make this request to SFR. Those that don't know what they're doing have
no place in the current state of this scene.

can everyone just leave the girl alone, you know the geri, geri, geri, girl. What's wrong with people being a bit wacko? If they had a funny eye, or where in a wheelchair, or where a different colour you would't take the piss because you would be judging someone on their looks, their ability, or there race. It's OK to judge somebody on their mind though, yeh? Tear it to shreds, no problem right?  Only two weeks ago someone I met died because he was suffering mentally a bit, and noone helped him, everyone was like "He's freakin mad" and laughed and ignored him. They didn't care about his mental anguish. Now he's dead beacause he couldn't cope with that. About no-one caring about him. I say let the girl post, or not, that's up to the moderaters, but leave her alone, and why doesn't everybody learn that other peoples minds are just as vunrable as their hearts.

WTF?!? Its one thing to rag on her for posting what she does.  Most cant

still intact.  BUT I dont think its right to start making fun of and attack 
somebody, who has not provoked you.  And no massive amounts of NRR's over the 
years do not count at provocation.  That comment was out of line.  Go ahead 
and comment on the constant ramblings we recieve on a daily basis, but dont 
make fun of a person just because it seems like the majority is against her.

Well, To fill you in on past events.. Geri has attacked me and several of my
close friends in the past. I don't feel sorry for making fun of someone who
is a complete jerk. Personally I think Geri has some issues but we all know
that. I honestly feel bad for the girl, but she should try and be a little
nicer when people tell her to stop her rambling..I think it's time for her
to speak up and let us know what she thinks..

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Calling All DJs

So, only people who are experienced should throw parties? The door has
closed, and there is no room for people to learn and, most likely, make
mistakes? I've never tried to throw a party, but I figured I could give it a
shot some day if I wanted to. Thanks for letting me know that I should defer
to the "established promoters."

Happy  :-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] time for a bit of sense.

Our corporate council has an interesting stance on morailty-

It is simply "how would things be if everyone did it?"

Like- is it wrong to rip a page out of a book in the library?
You might say yes, you might say no- but what if *everyone* ripped a
page out?
Obviously then there would be no books left.

I'm not one for censorship, and Terry made his moderation duties
clear-
But at the same time-
She's got the right to post nonsenical drivel (IMO)-
Just like I've got the right to tell her to shut it and stop wasting my
time.
...

Getting back to the original point- I think we should *ALL* begin
posting like she does.
I think that would sort out whether it was right or wrong pretty
quick...

The bionicle has glowing green eyes- he doesnt look as mean without his

another one.  What is he thinking just sitting there like that- I
think he wants to do something but doesn't know how.
Mmmm I like peach smoothies- and with salmon they are good.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Calling All DJs

For a guy with the name Happy you sure do seem pretty negative.. I think you
missed what he was saying completely. I think anyone who throws a party
should work with people and help out at events before they try and throw
their own..That way you learn a good portion of what goes on. Hell when I
threw my first party I had no clue about a ton of the stuff going on..But I
did know the basics and I got threw it..Just my opinion

Actually, considering many of her ramblings are on the superficial side and
often refer to her own faaaa-bu-lous looks, I think it's fair game. How come
we can pick on people's habits but not on their looks.  C'mon now. Equal
opportunity ragging rights for all!!! :)

d00d, did my post not make sense... read the post I made before that one
(stating how whenever I have ever made a comment about Geri she never
responds)... Then re-read the post you just responded to...

AHHH!!! it is all coming together now... Mr. Vincondoa may have some
intelligence after all....

Another give away that I was joking was the nice little "winking smiley
face" at the end of my post... We went over this maybe a year ago with
Shaman (from Blue Green) that the "winking smiley face" is roughly the
equivalent to a "j/k"....

p.s. whatsup with putting your signature in twice? once isn't enough?

It's a really good idea to crew a few parties first (helping bigger, more
established groups as a humble little servant), before throwing your own.
Ryan is not saying that you have to be an experienced promoter to
"deserve" throwing parties... but if you're charging people for something,
shouldn't you have your shit together?  It takes experience, and the best
way to do that is help crews that are doing it right.

It's also a good diea to take on a couple friends who have done the same,
with similar intentions.  That is the root of most successful collectives.

Learn what goes into security considerations at an underground, how
visuals and lights and sound work together to plan a room, how to work out
decorations, deal with a collective work force, space owners, etc.

It might be easy to throw a party... but you should have the experience
to deal with adversity should it arise.  Way too many posts about
promoters' first parties being a dangerous waste of money... don't be one.
Putting all the risk of an event on fate and the pocket books of your
guests is arrogant and dangerous...

I did sound for a lot of people's first parties back when I had a sound
system, and trust me... there's a BIG difference betweeen a first party
thrown by people who have no clue, and a first party thrown by people who
have learned from others' events by crewing different aspects of the
parties (building up to real resonsibility, not just staffed a water bar
or something like that) and communicating with the people who throw them.

Knowledge is power, research and experience are your friends.

What Nick said is what I meant by the post. Hearing someone say they're
booked and have to bring sound for their friend who booked them raises a
flag for me. If you haven't thrown a party, don't really know what you're
doing you risk a lot not just for yourself but for others who are out there
throwing parties. Venues are rare now and to have inexperienced people
risking the longevity of a venue bothers me.

For a guy with the name Happy you sure do seem pretty negative.. I think you
missed what he was saying completely. I think anyone who throws a party
should work with people and help out at events before they try and throw
their own..That way you learn a good portion of what goes on. Hell when I
threw my first party I had no clue about a ton of the stuff going on..But I
did know the basics and I got threw it..Just my opinion

point being, someone made a comment as a joke with a "winking smiley face"
after the comment, it started a flame war, and at the end of the flame war,
it was understood that the "winking smiley face" is the equivalent to a

Subject: [sfraves] positive aspects of bee pollen


Very great stuff, bees collect it and then use it to create their lives...
topics on sfr that still exist on sfr that don't have much to do with 
anything in particular, people collect those thoughts and then use them to 
create their lives...Good AndyW, good good analogy my friend.

for more info on the positive aspects of the great stuff check these out...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] positive aspects of bee pollen

I have an allergy to pollen. Particularly bad are my allergies to flowering
trees, like walnut blossoms. Those damn near killed me as a child. Would I
be able to take bee pollen as a food supplement without fear of severe
allergic reaction? Or will the stuff simply kill me?

I know this isn't normally the place to ask, but the SF Rave community seems
to be full of experts on dietary supplements.

Thanks in advance.

Although I delete all of her posts (unless it has an intriguing subject line) 
it's a sort of comfort to see her name in my inbox. Ever since I joined SFR 
in early '99 she's been adding her uniqueness to the list by way of a few 
eccentric e-mails every week. She's a staple of SFR, joining others such as 
Pol*E*wog,   Andy Tiedye, Andy W, Deepfog, Leslie, Terry, Vlad, TeknoDiva, 
BBoiBreks, MoonChyld, InnocentChild, Jennifer Love Hewitt.... even Osby. : )  
 These are just a few of the names that come to mind when I think of those 
who make up the personality and history of SFR. They add a bit of color to an 
otherwise monochromatic list. And Geri sort of plays the role of the strange 
aunt or uncle everyone has in their family. She may not be your favorite aunt 
but she certainly serves as an endless source of giggles! So resort to the 
tactic that always works with your strange Uncle Filbert- just smile and nod. 
After all, what would a family be if it weren't dysfunctional? : D

heart,
Alida

Damn, and I really was curious as to what it was. Oh well :-> (non 
winking smiley face)

To put my seldome spoken nowadays 2 cents in, I've been mostly posting 
on the heavily moderated forums of marijuana.com recently because 
the only thing that the only thing these unmoderated (or under-moderated)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Sewing Question

Has anybody on the list ever sewn their own club/party/playa wear?

If so, can you send some advice my way.  Specifically I am wondering
how hard it is to sew stretchy spandexy lycra kinda stuff.  Is it
unpossible? Do you need some kinda funky thread or machinery?

When you ask the old ladies at Jo Ann Fabrics this question they just
kind of stare at you...

Also, if anybody knows a lot about electro luminescent cable (the
stuff thats battery powered) I would love to know what the physical
limitations are on it.

Since I'm asking, if anybody knows of a way to conjur an army of
flying opossums to do my bidding, that would be great as well!

thanksnpeace
mike

I have noticed that there are bum lookers, bum riders and bum sitters.  I 
often use a nice lotion on my bum to keep it from chafing.  It's those 
hippies with their salmon smelling incense that aggravate my bum.  As I was 
sitting here meditating on the lack of good bottom parties I noticed that 
the shaman of events in the land of the green eyed salmons was providing 
some wonderful body care products at the latest bum event next week.  I 
worry about this.  I protect my bum, and I don't want invasive action 
here.  Bum people can be so cruel sometimes.  I can handle that, but it's 
the body protective synthetics I lack.

Alas,

Apollo

I have a severe reaction to bee stings.  Once, incredibly enough, I was 
bitten by a bee in Bloomingdale's mens' department in the middle of winter 
and there was great drama trying to find the bee to prove that I wasn't 
some crack head:)

I do use bee pollen supplements now, however.  You might try a small dose 
of royal jelly or pollen to test.  The reaction, if it occurs, shouldn't be 
severe.

Subject: [sfraves] I'd rather be dancing =)

I remember like on Tahnksgiving Weekend when I went outta town w/ the fam & 
we had Thanksgiving in like by Santa Barbera kinda... grrrrr... I was achin' 
4 some Groovy beats & somewhere 2 dance my ass off!!  Rather, I had 2 settle 
for a mini golf/arcade place to let off those vibes & spend money on video 
games that probably equaled out to a cover to like 1015 or 550... LoL

BUt I dunno man... I could do the family thing, hang out w/ relatives I see 
4-5 times a year, but man... when the clock hits 10pm... I wanna Groove!  
Hello 2Day =P

Dancing always gives me all these undescribable feeling of I dunno, Bliss, I 
dunno... a totally higher state (hey... sober anyway)  I mean, hear those 
yummy beats, yummy melodies, yummy sounds makes me jus' move & fly away!

I was remembering something that Alida posted once about closing her eyes 
when she dances & letting the music take her away!!  Then again, there was 
an Ascension moment when Alida & I were on the floor & this song came on!!  
But man, music does so much 2 like a person's mentality, ya know!!  Feelings 
of greatness come in, sometimes a sad song on the radio makes some1 have 2 
like do this mondo pull over & cry on the side of the freeway... la la la 
la... wait, I'm talkin' about dancing!!!

Ya know, the best 4 me is when there's like some Juicy Jungle playing on a 
kinda empty dance floor 'cause I get 2 like be this Mondo Space Hog & Jam!!  
LoL... Alota DJs Thanks me 4 danciong during their sets & stuff, but man... 
the Music is jus' so much Groovy stuff, ya know!

There was this 1 time @ Butterfly House when we were dancin' in the Garage & 
stuff!!  It wasw when "One More Time" like kinda jus' came out & it was 
playing!!  LoL... Jason DK coined the phrase "Candy House" when he heard 
that song... BUt man, we we're all dancing on the floor to this Groovy song 
& bein' total Goofs 'cause we were celebrating each others company, the 
Music, ya know... it was a Dope night man!!!

There was another time I remember @ Mad Hatter when Aryck, Miki, Ryan, & I 
like all met up there & Andy W was spinning that night!1  LoL... we had the 
best time jus' dancing w/ each other, hangin' out, drinking beers, & jus' 
totally havin' this Groovy time!!  LoL... even when Andy did this HUGE Train 
wreck, but it's OK, he recovered fine!!  Well, wait it wasn't 2 long after 
that when he shaved off all his long hair...hmmmmm

Point being to all this, I'd rather be in the company of Groove Family, 
Groovin' the night away on the floor, & makin' Memories w/ people I Love!!  
It's been hard doin' that on a 7 nihgts a week basis like I did 4 like 2 
years in a row w/o a car...LoL... but I go out & Dance as much as I can when 
possible =)

Then again, stayin' home & catchin' up on 2 Seasons of Charmed sin't so bad 
either!!  I have 2 convince my parents to like let me put the VCR i n my 
room so I won't miss my Thursday night lline up anymore since I"m never home 
on Thurs nights anymore & I keep missing FRIENDS...

OK... jus' some Food 4 Thught that's been building in my head lately =)  I 
mean, it's like wonter Holidays & man, there's alota family stuff comin' up 
& I dunno....LoL.... I'd rather be dancing after all the family festivities 
w/ family on the floor! =)



Take Care,
Later {8O)
Peace-=->Just Me~=~>O§bY

I don't know of any crews there, but I believe they are part of Mountain
Raves.  At least when I had my Utah site up, Pheonix was listed along
with mine for Mountain Raves.  There's at least a few old school vRavers
down there.

Oh my gosh...why has this even become an issue? 

Holidays blues getting people down so their taking it out on an eccentric?

We're all eccentric in our own ways and I don't see why she should be made fun of for posting to a list that is supposed to be a community. A community of people who *accept* one another the way they are. 

Now, can I *please* stop getting an inbox full of e-mails debating the relevance of her posts to this list?

actually, I love the cow palace. It's one of those places that reminds 
me of home. Big buildings in the middle of nowhere where events go on 
are quite entertaining to me.

Subject: [sfraves] RE: Linux

Bee Pollen is actually really nifty stuff.

Really, I don't know that for a fact, I'm just taking the word of some random
srtanger on that.  Really I'm not sure what bee bollen really is.  I know that
plants and flowers have pollen.  I definately know that pine cones have pollen.
 There's aome kind of plant that lives on the same hill as me in the city that
has helluva pollen.  I know that, because during pollen season it is totally
pointless to wash my car.  Sure, I can wash it.  But in less than a day, it'll
have a thick coating of pollen on it again.  Oddly enough, this usually happens
when I let it sit overnight when I'm sleeping.  I like to sleep.  I really
don't think I sleep enough.  Maybe I should smoke pot and quit showering like
some dirty hippy so I could sleep more.

But I didn't think bees had pollen?  Plants make pollen.  And bees are
animeals.  Oops, I mean animals.  Obviously no one should make a meal out of
bees; or of any other animal.  But the point is that animals don't make pollen.
 Actually, I don't think I really have a point.  But I like bee pollen, even
though it doesn't really come from bees.  But I like honey.  That comes from
bees.  Or at least that's what teacher told me.  I don't think I believe
teacher.  Because I once caught a bee and tried to make honey come out.  Honey
didn't come out.  The bee just bit me instead.  It hurt a lot.  I don't think I
like bees.

I don't really think I like pollen either.  My doctor says it's what makes me
sneeze a lot.  He also says it's what makes my eyes water and hurt a lot.  I
take these funny little pink pills so that I don't sneeze.  They also make my
eyes not water and hurt.  They also make me really sleepy.  Maybe I should eat
a bunch so that I can sleep without smoking that pot stuff.  It says on the
bottle not to drive when I take the pills.  But if I don't take the pills I
sneeze a lot and my eyes water and hurt.  Besides, it's fun to drive after I
take the pills.  Everything moves in slow motion.  It's like that movie with
keyanu reeves in it.

I don't like that movie though.  That one chick looks like a slutty whore in
all that black leather.  I bet she is a pot smoking hippy.  Well, no she's not,
she's too skinny.  Everybody knows that dirty hippies can't stop eating and are
all fat and ugly.  I bet she was a slutty hippy but is a tweaker now.  In fact,
I don't think I did see her eat at all in that movie.  What a whore.  She must
do lots of drugs.  Especially the way everything gets all blurry and green and
stuff in that movie.  And the way that mirror oozes around.  That movie was
made for dirty druggies.  I should rent it and write down all the credits and
send the names in to the dea.

I don't know what bee pollen or my car or my allergies or that movie has to do
with linux.  Or with raving.  Or even with san francisco.  But someone said
that everyone is doing it.  I think I'll go to the library now and tear a page
out of a book.  On second thought, I can't get to the library before it closes
today.  So I'll go tomorrow and tear two pages out, so I can make up for the
page I can't tear out today.


cya,
john

I knew that was coming. I was just waiting.

I thought about adding a little something about the "delete" and "filter" options, but I figured that issue had already been run into the ground. It was half mocking the response as well.  

::shakes head:: I'm really, really disappointed by the tone of that (message in response), I had no anger or irritation intended in my post. Just disappointment.
I don't understand people and why so much of this animosity seems to be pervading. 

I always thought of this list as a way to escape the kind of garbage that is in the everyday world. I suppose that this list, as well as this scene aren't like that anymore. 

I might as well get back into the punk scene. At least they don't have a facade of friendliness.

I have noticed that there are bum lookers, bum riders and bum sitters. I 
often use a nice lotion on my bum to keep it from chafing. It's those 
hippies with their salmon smelling incense that aggravate my bum. As I was 
sitting here meditating on the lack of good bottom parties I noticed that 
the shaman of events in the land of the green eyed salmons was providing 
some wonderful body care products at the latest bum event next week. I 
worry about this. I protect my bum, and I don't want invasive action 
here. Bum people can be so cruel sometimes. I can handle that, but it's 
the body protective synthetics I lack.

Alas,

i think i am almost ready, however, my projects aren't...does that make sense? my projects are all scattered, but my emotions are really even keel about everything in my life...my only concern now is the potential effect, and my lack of interest in the aftermath or rather AN aftermath. i like pure pleasure, period.  basically, today is a really important day for a lot of people, and it is crucial that balance is maintained, because if not, well, maybe this is just a hard time of year for a lot of people...i have heard that many times...the holidays are a stressful time for a lot of people, so it is really important to take especially good care of yourself and your health at this time. if today is not THE day of cake, well, it should be, because i am celebrating. :)

Is it just me, or does like anyone else see a problem with wearing playdoh 
as a pet fish?  I mean, in all sincerity... which it is, I am leaving the 
vida loca, but I like it.  I sometimes count the number of Christmas tree 
ornaments that I can eat with my bum, but then I realize that I am just a 
wiggling, pulsating worm of bum.  How exciting, life is just one ocsillating 
conundrum of hedonism.  Man oh man do I love me some fried tofu wrapped up 
in barnicle bushels.  Is matzo ball soup an animal, a vegitable, or a 
mineral?  Anyway, I have to create a new and glossy me for next months party 
already.  Drive safe and save donut holes, they are endangered.  Love, -TMB

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Has anybody ever seen Geri Dahl?

Course you could do what I do and be a part of many scenes at once. Punk
for your aggression (anti-flag/ bouncing souls a couple days ago was
dope!). Metal for your self loathing (hi neurosis!). Goth and Industrial
for your cynicism, house music for your hoochie tendencies. Drum and
bass for your beer swilling, I'm cooler than you attitude, and I ain't
frontin! Psytrance for your worldly "mind expansiveness". Hardcore for
when you want to feel like you have ADD.

Or you could go raving for the all the love you receive, except when
people gang up on you behind your back and decide that you don't deserve
to be loved, and in fact deserve to be evicted from the group.

Of course you could just be yourself, for times when you want to be
simple and just feel like you.

Hope I didn't miss anyone in my labels... 

-tim   


PS-- for an added bonus can you guess what kind of music I am listening
to right now?

I knew that was coming. I was just waiting.

I thought about adding a little something about the "delete" and
"filter" options, but I figured that issue had already been run into the
ground. It was half mocking the response as well.  

::shakes head:: I'm really, really disappointed by the tone of that
(message in response), I had no anger or irritation intended in my post.
Just disappointment.
I don't understand people and why so much of this animosity seems to be
pervading. 

I always thought of this list as a way to escape the kind of garbage
that is in the everyday world. I suppose that this list, as well as this
scene aren't like that anymore. 

I might as well get back into the punk scene. At least they don't have a
facade of friendliness.

fuck you. Good answer.

Subject: [sfraves] bsp: *SCATTER* this Sun (12/15) *TECHNO*

the underground MESH party rocked last Sat, and the same folks are
doing their usual techno monthly SCATTER this Sunday.

here's the line up I overheard:

	Brain Damage (live)
	Daniel V (Cloudfactory OG)
	Lisa Fox
	Clairity vs. J-Bot

9pm-2am, 21+, free, located at the Galaxy (on upper Haight St., across
from Amoeba recs, & next to F8)

hope to see some of you out,

james

Subject: Fwd: Re: [sfraves] Cool roomate looking for a cool room with cool people.

Uhhh.  my website amef-radio.com's server disapeered and was taken over by 
my partners friend in seattle.  I dont think the mixes were transfered to 
the new server but ill let u know if theyre available online.  i have hella 
different cds tho.  believe me, I play good stuff and mix it well.  I stand 
behind my product.

sorry the reply for this line is so late, but can i ask a serious question?
why should you care about the permits it isnt your party.
i think that if you really have a problem with this party its not becuz 
people are hurting the so called "valley scene" i think its becuz cats are 
taking money away from your pocket and the developement of your production 
company.
this is just another example of hate on a mailing list.
lets just party and enjoy ourselves, not hate on everyone.

we have enough trouble with the scene going away. AS IT STANDS, many people 
would already say the scene here is nonexistent and it becuz of the haters,
please party and bring mad love!

The result of the first three instructions will be the same regardless 
of the number one originally chooses, with the exception of 11.

10 * 9 = 90
9 + 0 = 9

9 * 9 = 81
8 + 1 = 9

8 * 9 = 72
7 + 2 = 9

...

2 * 9 = 18
1 + 8 = 9

1 * 9 = 9
0 + 9 = 9

>Take that number and subtract 5 from it..

Now everyone has 4.

>Now each number corresponds to a letter (1 = a, 2 = b, 3 = c).... Take the number you have, figure out which letter it corresponds to and then think of a Country that begins with that letter...

Now everyone has "D".

How many countries are there that start with D? As far as I know there 
are four. Denmark, Djibouti, Dominica, and Dominican Republic. Of those 
four, Denmark is the clearly the first that would come to the minds of most.

>Now take the name of that Country, look at the second letter in the name, and think of an animal that begins with that letter...
>
Now everyone has an E.

What animal that starts with an "E" is most likely to come to mind 
first? Eel? Elk? Eurasian goshawk? Not likely. It will be elephant.

>Now, think of what color that Animal is...
>
This is not any leap. Everyone has elephant, so everyone now has grey.

>Now let me remind you that there are no GREY ELEPHANTS in DENMARK..
>
Of course. How could any native English speaker have arrived at anything 
else?

According to police and witnesses, Moby, whose real name is Richard M. =
Melville, was approached by the men about 1 a.m. Thursday outside the =
Paradise Rock Club. One of the men punched Moby in the back of the head =
and on the right side of his face, breaking the singer's glasses and =
cutting and bruising his face.=20


When two club security guards tried to stop the attack, the assailants =
sprayed a macelike substance at Moby, Moby's manager and the guards, and =
then fled, police said.=20


Moby, 37, declined medical attention.=20


The assailants said nothing during the attack, and the motive is =
unknown, said Paradise manager Jeff Marshall.=20


During the concert, Moby, a self-described pacifist, had spoken out =
against aggression and violence.=20


He wrote on his Web site that he is not angry about the attack, just =
mystified about the motive. He has asked the attackers to post an =
explanation.=20


"And if anyone sees me in the next couple of weeks and I have some big =
bruises or stitches on my face, well at least you know why," Moby wrote. =



Moby is electronic music's first bona fide superstar. His 1999 album, =
"Play," sold 10 million copies. For the past two years, the Connecticut =
native has headlined a touring festival that has featured guests such as =
David Bowie (news).=20

I mean.. to think that Moby is still considered a "techno" artist... ;)


Honestly, though, I wanna know what kinda toughguy attacks a wiry vegan
pacifist and has any sort of dignity left.  Maybe they were crazed Eminem
disciples. Or maybe they'd listened to "18" for the first time.

note the capitol "BETWEEN" in the first step of the original email...

;-)

anything BETWEEN 1 and 11 would be 2 through 10, right?

*************************
2 x 9 =18 :: 1 + 8 = 9
3 x 9 = 27 :: 2 + 7 = 9
4 x 9 = 36 :: 3 + 6 = 9
5 x 9 = 45 :: 4 + 5 = 9
6 x 9 = 54 :: 5 + 4 = 9
7 x 9 = 63 :: 6 + 3 = 9
8 x 9 = 72 :: 7 + 2 = 9
9 x 9 = 81 :: 8 + 1 = 9
10 x 9 = 90 :: 9 + 0 = 9
***************************

Like S21266 said, any native English speaking person would come to the same
conclusion...

No, anything between 2 and 10 would 2-10

1 works in the 'equation'  11 does not.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Nonsense post #1

it's amazing how they do it.  swim like that.  salmon.  pink and tender,  when i used to eat such
things.  but like so many not eating it any more there is now a shortage of frsh persimon at the
farmers market each tuesday.  is there an abundance of salmon ?  there were plenty bunches of leafy
fluffy yummy spinach... its good to the finish you know.  made me jump up and want to wiggle my
smooth bum like a salmon.  there was a child playing hopscotch and nobody seemed to mind, so i put
my left foot in, took my left foot out... put it back in and shook it.  you know, come to think of
it, what if the hokey pokey really *is* what it's all about ?

Quotes for the Week: Inspired by Random SFR List Topics...

"He was so narrow minded he could see through a keyhole with both
eyes ..."


You may easily play a joke on a man who likes to argue -- agree with
him.
                -- Ed Howe


"It was pleasant to me to get a letter from you the other day.  Perhaps I
should have found it pleasanter if I had been able to decipher it.  I
don't think that I mastered anything beyond the date (which I knew) and
the signature (which I guessed at).  There's a singular and a perpetual
charm in a letter of yours; it never grows old, it never loses its novelty
=2E... Other letters are read and thrown away and forgotten, but yours are
kept forever -- unread.  One of them will last a reasonable man a
lifetime."

Friday, December 13, 2002 ** Monthly: Nectar **

 (Second Friday of the Month) - Rowena of Risque and Yana of Walking Art
 Liquid Latex present Nectar.

Deep within a beautiful, exotic flower is a small, sweet, ambrosial
center. Rowena of Risque and Yana of Walking Art would like to introduce
Nectar; a select, fashionable and attractive crowd, in an exquisite,
sensual atmosphere, surrounded by deep, seductive house beats. You are
invited to revel in an atmosphere steeped in sensuality. You are invited
to lose yourself to engaging house music or just sit back and watch. You
are invited to be hypnotized by sultry and seductive models displaying
unique liquid latex designs.We have been meeting a lot of wonderful new
people and would like to introduce our old friends to our new friends, and
make Nectar the night for people to mingle, dance and enjoy themselves.

A note to our new guests: This is a woman-centric event being hosted by
two women. It is a place where women and couples can go and dance the
night away, chill with friends, or explore an inner sensual side. To keep
this atmosphere relaxed, fun and well-balanced we ask that each gentleman
attending Nectar come escorted by a lady. This is not a swingers club.

Cover $40 couples, $10 women, 21+

contemporaries can brag about. They have sold out clubs across the nation
and show no signs of letting up soon.

 they kick off 2003 at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco with DJ Logic and

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Nonsense post #1

Dude, you would have loved alaska. The salmon run was absolutely awesome 
to watch during the summer time. My brother, dad, and I would go fishing 
down at the mouth of the nome river, and would catch dozens of salmon. 
It was really cool. We're talking fresh salmon. No impurities or 
anything. Hundreds of thousands
Come to think of it, that's one of the only things I miss about alaska, 
short of snowboarding the powder on newton mountain about 30 miles 
outside of nome. Just the purity of the place was awesome. Nobody for 
miles and miles around. You would drive your snowmobile on top of the 
mountain, drop whoever's snowboarding off, go to the bottom of the 
mountain, and watch as you carved fresh untouched snow. Oh, and no trees 
either. :)
It was great.

Subject: [sfraves] The Man Who Taught His Ass to Talk nrr

Did I ever tell you about the man who taught his ass to talk? His whole
abdomen would move up and down you dig farting out the words. It was
unlike anything I had ever heard.

"This ass talk had sort of a gut frequency. It hit you right down there
like you gotta go. You know when the old colon gives you the elbow and it
feels sorta cold inside, and you know all you have to do is turn loose?
Well this talking hit you right down there, a bubbly, thick stagnant
sound, a sound you could smell.

"This man worked for a carnival you dig, and to start with it was like a
novelty ventriliquist act. Real funny, too, at first. He had a number he
called "The Better 'Ole' that was a scream, I tell you. I forget most of
it but it was clever. Like, "Oh I say, are you still down there, old
thing?'

"'Nah! I had to go relieve myself.'

"After a while the ass start talking on its own. He would go in without
anything prepared and his ass would ad-lib and toss the gags back at him
every time.

"Then it developed sort of teeth-like little raspy in- curving hooks and
start eating. He thought this was cute at first and built and act around
it, but the asshole would eat its way through his pants and start talking
on the street, shouting out it wanted equal rights. It would get drunk,
too, and have crying jags nobody loved it and it wanted to be kissed same
as any other mouth. Finally it talked all the time day and night, you
could hear him for blocks screaming at it to shut up, and beating it with
his fist, and sticking candles up it, but nothing did any good and the
asshole said to him: 'It's you who will shut up in the end. Not me.
Because we don't need you around here any more. I can talk and eat AND
shit.'

"After that he began waking up in the morning with a transparent jelly
like a tadpole's tail all over his mouth. This jelly was what the
scientists call un-D.T., Undifferentiated Tissue, which can grow into any
kind of flesh on the human body. He would tear it off his mouth and the
pieces would stick to his hands like burning gasoline jelly and grow
there, grow anywhere on him a glob of it fell. So finally his mouth sealed
over, and the whole head would have have amputated spontaneous- except for
the EYES you dig. That's one thing the asshole COULDN'T do was see. It
needed the eyes. But nerve connections were blocked and infiltrated and
atrophied so the brain couldn't give orders any more. It was trapped in
the skull, sealed off. For a while you could see the silent, helpless
suffering of the brain behind the eyes, then finally the brain must have
died, because the eyes WENT OUT, and there was no more feeling in them
than a crab's eyes on the end of a stalk.

someone told me that it is going to be extra, extra, extra windy in s.f. after three p.m.....if you are driving, be extra, extra, extra cafeful....actually, maybe you should not drive. californians are noted for not knowing how to drive in stormy weather...they aren't particularly alert to slippery roads and with their cell phones on too, you can guarantee that it is going to be scary...that and friday drinks still wearing off while making it out for saturdays and life stress....i would not drive if i were you...if you don't fly away without spreading your wings, i would be most surprised. f.y.i....i haven't started an argument with anyone ever in my entire life as far as i can remember. it is not in my nature to as far as i know. that doesn't mean that i don't rely on law enforcement though. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Happy Happy

Wow! This was a fun experience! As I said last night, I got the call last
minute, so I jumped in the shower, grabbed my records  and headed to the
party. I walked into this big old house in West Oakland, kinda near the
Noodle Factory and started looking for my friend. I saw several girls
dressed as guys, and guys dressed as girls, but I didn't see my friend. I
called him, and when I said, "where are you?" this really ugly chick in a
short dress with bright pink hair and stripped stockings said "I'm right
here!" LOL! He apologized for forgetting to tell me that this was a drag
party. I do wish I had known, cause I love theme parties, but oh well. His
tables are setup in a room where there is a band playing. They are kinda
sloppy and I figured that they were drunk, but they were having fun and lots
of folks are rocking out to them. The bass player blows his amp, so he sits
out while the rest of them play for about 1/2 hour longer. The set ends when
the lead guitarist starts bumping against the drum kit, then body checking
the rhythm guitarist and culminates with him flopping into the drums. I
loved it! They didn't break their instruments, which I've never seen in
person, but they did erupt into a cacophony of sound!
    My friend started spinning techno, then went into some trance. People
were grooving on it, and I said to him "Hey, they're loving this foofy
stuff! I tagged in and spun in a trance track. When I was just about to mix
in the second trance track, everyone left the floor! I was like SHIT! Now
what do I do? It was too late to match something different, so I had to
bring in the trace track, but no one danced to it. I told my friend "Damn, I
lost them!" I suggested that we go into some breaks to change the vibe. We
tagged back and forth, and people were digging it, but the problem was, the
wooden floor was really bouncy, and when people were dancing
enthusiastically (and drunkenly) it made the tables skip. The worst came
when this one reeeeeallly drunk long haired guy with a long beard pulled his
dress over his head, pulled off his panty hose and started jumping around
the room butt naked! I looked down at the table, since I really didn't want
to see a naked guy in front of me, but the problem was that he was jumping
so much and the needles were jumping so much that there was no way to mix. A
lot of the time, all we could do was cut from one track to the other without
mixing. Some people were so wasted that they didn't even notice, but the
ones who did were sympathetic to our challenges!
    After a while, the booze ran out and people started leaving, so I
decided that it was time to bring up the tempo. I started to drop some d&b,
and people were loving it! I tried to tag with my friend, but his stuff was
too slow to play with mine, so I spun until he had the fever again and I let
him bring the tempo back down. It was still really hard, because although
the few people who were dancing were trying to stay back from the tables,
but they were still skipping. All in all, I think that this was a great
experience for me. It was totally spur of the moment. It was a challenging
environment to play in, and above all, it was fun!

Happy  :-)

I was chillin at home tonight, not planning on doing anything much, saving
my energy for moksha, when I got a call. It was a friend who's spinning at a
house party, and they need another DJ, preferably d&b, so I got the call,
and now I get to spin!  Woo Hoo!  Just thought I'd share my joy with you
all!

This seems apropo for a Dahl post, thanks Karina.

"It was pleasant to me to get a letter from you the other day.

Perhaps I should have found it pleasanter if I had been able to decipher it.

I don't think that I mastered anything beyond the date (which I knew) and
the signature (which I guessed at).

There's a singular and a perpetual charm in a letter of yours; it never
grows old,
it never loses its novelty....

Other letters are read and thrown away and forgotten, but yours are
kept forever -- unread.

One of them will last a reasonable man a lifetime."

And all you @ the unspellable, unpronounceable, Moksha UG, 2nite,
(it's greek for soemthing, inn't?), have a good time, if Sarilion brought
the flags, I'll be with you all

Subject: [sfraves] Thank you to Moksha Tribe crew for the wonderful rave party in San Francisco

Words cannot even begin to express the high that I feel this morning after
dancing to my heart's delight at the Moksha Tribe underground held in San
Francisco, called "Ouroboros." OK, I know that it is only a party, but each
person makes his or her own moments within the scene, and these moments were
special to me.

Many native Californians are jaded to their own state's special character,
but every time that I drive over the Bay Bridge into the big city I get a
thrill, even with traffic (especially at night when the city is bright).

I found the map point and my good friend, Carl (NomadicDJ to those "in the
know"; http://www.nomadicdj.com/frameset.htm) and he expressed concern over
the venue's plumbing problems when I asked him about his upcoming set.
Apparently, a pipe burst in the secondary room so all music was to be
concentrated in one area, thus taking away his DJ spot. Nevertheless, he
assured me that everything would be all right and I got my directions to the
secondary map point.

Without giving away proprietary details, I just have to say that it was
funny to be walking around in the heart of San Francisco, Market Street,
trying to find the dudes with the "green patches" at the second map point,
who had directions. I met some fellow ravers and we had a good laugh (and
some frustration) trying to find these people. We ended up at Carl's Jr, the
hamburger joint, and by happenstance found a "green patch dude" who told us
to split up into smaller groups to get to the venue nearby.

I do not know the ravers, whom I was hanging out with, but I walked up the
street with one of the guys after we got final directions, and then I
spotted the Bijou Hotel on the street corner. I insisted that we go inside
to check it out, because I know someone who works there, and it is a
happening hotel for the international crowd. My fellow raver thanked me for
letting him know about this aspect of the hospitality industry. If you are
interested, check out this link:
http://www.jdvhospitality.com/hotels/sf_bijou.html
It seems like a cool place to stay, especially if you have guests from out
of town.

Anyway, we immediately found our way over to the venue, went inside, and it
was a friendly crowd with good music and a wonderful vibe. I found one of my
friends, Mike, whom I met at The Stud last month, and we were both glad to
see each other. We danced for many beats, hung out in the smoking area, and
lounged in the chill room.

I found a comfortable chair near a fan, beside Ravin Rizz's massage table,
and spent a few moments with Mike just cooling down (The venue was hot, as
is typical with San Francisco underground rave locations). At least they had
fans!

I met many people whom I know from the scene, including Jessica, Happy,
Nick, Mikah, Osby, Tom M. (DenverhouseDJ), Michael the Red Stickman, Joey,
and of course, Apollo, and I received warm greetings and hugs from all
concerned. I am so happy right now, just basking in the warmth of human
friendship.

In addition, I am feeling glad to have someone else in my life, Mike, my new
friend who I danced beside almost all of the night. You have to understand,
usually I travel "solo" to such events, and it was a pleasure to meet up
with someone special to me. He is a native to the area, but we have similar
interests.

I do not have much else to say, other than it was a great party because it
was small and intimate (limited to 200 people). But in closing, I remember
that last week my swim instructor at the gym said that dancing is good for
your abdominal muscles, and I believe her now, because I really got into the
groove and now I feel the pain!

Good night (I mean, good morning) to all,
Greg

Ok to start with I want to second everything Greg VP just said... =
Ouroboros was really a wonderful party, with that small intimate vibe =
that is sometimes lost these days. I want to thank the whole crew who =
made the party possible, it seemed that there were soo many people =
working the party, handing out water, picking up trash, cleaning the =
bathrooms or just moping the water up from the floor. You guys really =
made my night.=20

We got there around 1:30 (My girl Nicole, friend Julian and I) and =
started to get our groove on to the tasty beats right away. The music =
was really great all night but I had to shake my head when I thought I =
heard the beastie boys in there..... I was right but it worked really =
well... :-) The decorations were great also, it created the perfect =
atmosphere !

Hours of Dancing, Nicole got a massage from Riz (Mondo Thanks) and we =
hung out on the sheepskin rug in the chill room meeting, got to meet and =
talk to many great new people.

When the music stopped and the lights came on, the three of us headed =
down the waterfront, we got there just in time to watch the sun come up =
and illuminate the Golden Gate Bridge.... a perfect ending to the =
perfect night. After a short stop at Mels for some nourishment we made =
the trip back out to the east bay.

Now its time to rug up in front of the warm fireplace and watch video's =
and snooze the rest of the day away.

Thanks to everyone who put this party on, for all those people we talked =
to over the course of the night.. We hope to see you all again soon.....

Love
Aussie, Nicole & Julian

 I want to add my thanks to the Moksha Tribe crew as well! Outside of the
loss of the second room due to flooding, it was great! I heard that
the water in the second room was due to rain, not a burst water pipe,
but maybe it was a broken rain gutter?

 The party was a benefit for the Larkin Street Youth Services
organization:

 http://www.larkinstreetyouth.org/index.html

 ... which I didn't know anything about before the party, but it seems
to be a valuable and needed source of aid to San Francisco's homeless
youth.

 I got layed off on Fiday, so I really needed this party to help lift my
spirits. Which it did ! I didn't pull an all nighter, but I compresed
enough dancing into the time I was there to feel some aches this
morning ( but they're good aches! ). I was the guy in the white t-shirt
with little smiley faces and a little label stuck on the collar with
"LARRY" written on it.

 Also thanks to Mike Migurski and the rest (?) of the lighting F/X crew
for not having a fog machine. And thanks to the 99% of you who actually
did not smoke tobacco on the dance floor, per the requests on the No
Smoking signs.

 Looking forward o the next Moksha Tribe event ( hopefully in drier
weather ) -

 - Larry Ching

 I had to ask the floor mopper his name ( John ) because of the unique
way he was doing it - he layed down a big towel, stood on it, and
shuffle-danced it around the dancefloor! Both funny and effective!

Keep 'em guessing cus the mysteries abound. 
 
Is she real?
Is it a girl?
What other lists does she entertain?
What's it like to be a cult figure? ( you can't be a cult figure unless
you give people something to figure out!)
How many people sub just for her?
What is the entertain/annoy ratio?
Will there be a book of sex and make-up tips?
What does her house look like?
Who are her friends?
What's in her fridge?
Why has'nt someone done the docu-drama/reality TV show yet?
Where's the website?
When do we get the advice column/self help workshop?
Who's her agent?
Will she let her fans down?
Is there going to be an action figure soon?
 
ENQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW !!!!!!!

Subject: [sfraves] Moksha Tribe review from chewy

I had fun at Moksha Tribe last night. It was my first
party, and my first time in San Francisco. It is a
really noisy place and there are lots of people. But I
had fun saying hi to all of them while we were walking
to the party.

The place was really coloful, and there were lots of
pretty lights and friendly people there. I just ran all
over the place as soon as I got there and said hi to
everyone. I found a tennis ball and then people threw
it across the dance floor and I got to chase it. I
liked chasing the ball all over =) I got a  bracelet
from joey, but it was too big for my arm and too small
for my neck, so I wore it on my back.

I took a little nap with Jessica in the chill room,
then played some more. Thankfully, no one stepped on
me, because I'm kinda short. Keri's chili was really
good, but I only ate one bean because I didn't want to
get diarrhea.

Sorry to Andy Tie Dye for barking at you, your cape was
just so colorful and I wanted to play with it. Maybe we
can play next time.

I had to leave early because it was getting too loud
and I had to go poo. But thanks Apollo, Delia, Uncle
Osby, and everyone else that played with me.  I had fun
at my first party =)

Subject: [sfraves] Moksha Tribe Thanks You...

--=====================_26932504==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

On behalf of the Moksha Tribe collective I send our heartfelt thanks to all 
the dancers who attended Ouroboros last night.  I don't review our parties, 
but even with all the work involved in throwing a party I had a really 
great time myself and was able to dance a bit to every set.

The collective often talks about the excellent people who come to our 
parties, and this was no exception:  many, many good, passionate dancers, 
who bring a respectful, loving vibe -- folks we really have come to view as 
family.  All of you really rock!!!!  We were fortunate to spend an evening 
celebrating dance, music and life with the likes of you.

As you may know, there is much drama and stress preceding a party and one 
must be prepared to deal with any contingencies that arise.

Moksha had originally intended to do a relatively small, one-room party at 
the venue in SF.  After doing a thorough inspection tour of the facility we 
discovered that there was a very large storage room off the main dance 
area:  a sort of no-mans' land shared with a hotel next door but "owned" by 
neither the venue lessor or the hotel.  It was full of junk, however.  So 
seeing an opportunity for another room of music I negotiated with the venue 
owner to obtain access to half of that room.  The crew went in two weeks 
ago and hauled out what seemed like tons of garbage and then cleaned and 
prepared the space for dancing.

Along comes the typhoon from Guam or whatever.  Those of you who attended 
know that Ouroboros was in a basement, so there was a general concern that 
the whole space might be flooded in the storm.  The SF sewage system is an 
archaic deal that was never designed to deal with heavy rains.  As we were 
driving to the venue Saturday afternoon in a van loaded with equipment and 
decorations, detouring around fallen trees and flooded streets, a massive 
wind-rain event overwhelmed us right near City Hall and we were almost 
forced to pull over.  Then I get a call from the venue saying that a pipe 
had burst in the storage room and it was flooded.   When we arrived shortly 
thereafter I expected to see the whole space under water.  Fortunately, 
only the second room was affected.  We pumped it out and repaired the pipe, 
but the floors were damp and smelly and there was no guarantee that if the 
storm persisted the pipe would hold.  We decided that there really could be 
a risk of electrocution back there with all the sound and other lighting 
and went back to the one-room party.  There are times when one must make 
the best of what one is given.

But the party went off with no other problems.  We ran all night long.  No 
police. No other drama.  Just lots of good fun with a great group of ravers.

We truly hope that all of you who came had a memorable evening.  The only 
reason we do these events is to bring some light and happiness to our 
family in these often dark, and certainly damp, times.

Again, Moksha Tribe sends much love and appreciation to our extended 
family!!!!!

Apollo for Moksha Tribe.

Hi Chewy:)

I'm happy that I finally had a chance to meet you last night.  I had seen 
your picture and was really looking forward to playing with you.

And all the Moksha Tribe crew had fun romping with you.  In fact, we've 
made you an honorary crew member.  See you next party Chewy!!!

Much love,

Apollo

hello,
i really like the entertainment and sense of community i feel when reading everyone's posts, day to day...even the annoying ones.  we won't mention names.  i would like to know if there are any other "forums"  or lists or whatever you call this...out there that people subscribe to that you would recommend.  other raver lists would be best...maybe southern california or west coast...even europe!

Ashes to ashes, fun to funky, we know Major Tom's a 
junkie, strung out in heavens high, hitting an all time 
low...

Just a slow Monday...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ATP: Am I the only one left

I hear you. I guess I could write a small review about the b-family party
this weekend. Great crowd, cool space, beautiful people. By beautiful people
I mean that was a damn good looking crowd with such a fashionable artsy
sense of dress. If you had to explain what the younger side of the artsy
soma crowd looks like this party would be a shining example. Yum! Music I'm
sure was great, but due to some mishaps in the planning the sound was
horrible. Jay made it better but it still hurt.The energy level was really
high and people were dancing. For me it was more of a social event. It was
great to go and know less than 10 people for once. I miss those days of
anonymity. Bison Brewing provided the drinks for the night and I must say,
hard iced tea is pretty good! GFunk is a lush. Ghetto lushous indeed.

Oh and I have to add how much I love sfpd. They just don't care. I flipped a
bitch in the middle of 17th and the cop pulled me over for no front lisence
plate. I haven't even registered the car yet and when asked where the plate
was I told him the seller was looking for it. Didn't care that I didn't have
registration, proof of insurance, didn't even mention the u-turn. Just gave
me a $10 ticket and that was that. Now if only small town cops like Danville
were like that...

Now I'm at work waiting on people to get their shit done so I can get my
work done. In the meantime it's all about redesigning my gauge faces for my
car from scratch.

http://forums.vwvortex.com/zerothread?id=620957 - this is the tach for the
car. I'm hand making these using backlight (not BLACKlight) film and custom
led/fiber optic illumination. None of that ghetto green EL stuff that all
the honda kiddies use. If you have a 90 - 91.5 G60 Corrado or 90 - 93 Passat
I have gauges for you. All hand re-designed in Illustrator for clarity and
seperations.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ATP: Am I the only one left

i'll add my $.02 on sfpd caring/not caring.
it was halloween '00, i was up in sf to catch BT at the warfield, leaving
the show my friends decided they wanted to drive (my car, go figure). we
start heading up 5th and decide to make an illegal left onto market (well,
again, they made the decision). as they were making the left, i noticed a
cop was at the light, so about 1/2 a block down where fulton comes out, he
pulled us over.

nevermind the masses of drunkards on the street, or down at castro, or all
the people making illegal u-turns on market, he pulled us over for making
and illegal turn, didn't mind that the drive had corrective lense
requirement and wasn't wearing them, or that it was an out of state expired
license, just the illegal turn sir.

long story short, when our whole ordeal was over, he told us we could leave,
and we asked if we could make another (illegal) left back onto market from
where he had pulled us over, he said 'sure' and stopped traffic to allow us
back onto market.

i love sfpd.

Subject: [sfraves] Plur Dead?  (REPOST--Sorry Email probs)

PLUR, I suppose, sounds a little outdated and clich=E9.  However, it's a =
cornerstone of this community, just as much as "Freedom, Liberty, and =
Justice for all" is a cornerstone of our society--though both seem to be =
getting outdated.  So, I will throw out this PLUR term a bit in this =
email, just as an acronym we all hopefully agree on deserves some place =
in our dance culture.
=20
I went to an underground this last weekend.  Thrown by my favorite SF =
group.  The music was awesome, the mood of the people working the =
underground were awesome.  Everything was perfect, just as I have come =
to expect from this group, and really, SF Raves in general.
=20
Back to this PLUR thing.  The last letter is R.  Respect.  Respect that =
we are all adults, and we are all adult and capable of respecting each =
other's beliefs in this community.  If we're gay, like pot, like E, like =
K, like rum, like to dance on our hands swinging poi with our feet--it's =
all good.  We all RESPECT each other, because if we don't want to =
respect, we just walk out those front doors back into the world.
=20
So here is MY issue.  I am late 20's.  My boyfriend is late teens.  Big =
deal, love happens.  We're both very happy with each other, and both of =
us compliment the other in the most perfect of ways.  Always, we have =
been accepted for being ourselves, however, this last party, some girl =
actually berated and scorned us for our relationship.  I totally, for a =
moment, felt like I was at Polyesters.  So my question is, is PLUR =
fading, or it is just fading for me.  Any insight? =20
=20
And my advice for this chick, if you want to make people feel like they =
are in a mainstream hate club, why don't you and your prejudices just go =
to one yourself.
=20
Peace.

I don't think PLUR is fading... It's just that no matter where you go, no
matter how great the community as a whole is, there will *always* be
assholes. It's human nature. However, I do think there's a lot more
hostility and negativity in the world now than there was 5 or 6 years ago,
but that's just my experience. I think it's more a reflection of the world
and the state of everyone in it, as opposed to 'the scene' - think of it as
a microcosm.

Because then she wouldn't be blazing new trails and spreading venom, which
would undermine her agenda.. right?  (Sorry, just playing devil's advocate
there..)

Well, PLUR aside, you're going to run into some rude people no matter where
you go, so just don't let it get to you. It's life in the big city. There is
a certain lack of respect in large metropolitan areas because there's just
too many people concentrated in one area.

But I know what you mean, and sometimes when people say things, we just wear
this BIG chip on our shoulders, especially me. I don't take criticism well.
I'm surprised that I haven't kicked someone's ass yet. Maybe that day will
come; hopefully not (spanking is better).

One time, at a weekly party in Oakland, this dude said, "Why are you dancing
that way, it's boring--you're just moving back and forth." As if it really
matters, but I just got really pissed off and let it ruin my evening. I
stormed off to the main bar and got drunker than a skunk. Didn't dance
anymore. That's not like me at all.

Learned my lesson from that one: as I said, blow them off (rude people). You
will never see this chick again. Just be happy with your BF--sounds like a
good relationship to me. I think she was just jealous. And envy breeds
contempt.

PLUR, I suppose, sounds a little outdated and cliché.  However, it's a
cornerstone of this community, just as much as "Freedom, Liberty, and
Justice for all" is a cornerstone of our society--though both seem to be
getting outdated.  So, I will throw out this PLUR term a bit in this email,
just as an acronym we all hopefully agree on deserves some place in our
dance culture.

I went to an underground this last weekend.  Thrown by my favorite SF group.
The music was awesome, the mood of the people working the underground were
awesome.  Everything was perfect, just as I have come to expect from this
group, and really, SF Raves in general.

Back to this PLUR thing.  The last letter is R.  Respect.  Respect that we
are all adults, and we are all adult and capable of respecting each other's
beliefs in this community.  If we're gay, like pot, like E, like K, like
rum, like to dance on our hands swinging poi with our feet--it's all good.
We all RESPECT each other, because if we don't want to respect, we just walk
out those front doors back into the world.

So here is MY issue.  I am late 20's.  My boyfriend is late teens.  Big
deal, love happens.  We're both very happy with each other, and both of us
compliment the other in the most perfect of ways.  Always, we have been
accepted for being ourselves, however, this last party, some girl actually
berated and scorned us for our relationship.  I totally, for a moment, felt
like I was at Polyesters.  So my question is, is PLUR fading, or it is just
fading for me.  Any insight?

And my advice for this chick, if you want to make people feel like they are
in a mainstream hate club, why don't you and your prejudices just go to one
yourself.

Peace.

Raf

I can tell you this, Raf, our parties are designed to be totally=20
non-judgmental:  a free zone where everyone can be comfortable as long as=20
they respect other dancers.  Moksha Tribe tolerates absolutely no=20
discrimination or bigotry of any kind at our events.  Had I known of this=20

Much love and respect to you, Raf.

Ryan and I experienced this same thing just.. er.. two months ago was it? 
except it was smeared all over SFR. I'm eighteen and he's twenty-seven so 
similar age difference as you and your boyfriend, though you may face a bit 
more criticism because you're "the older woman." Scaaary. ; ) I'll never get 
why people feel like they are validated in judging LOVE of all things. 
*shrug*   All I can offer is to maintain your own sense of PLUR because the 
great thing is that it tends to be contagious. ; )   And as long as you feel 
good, peaceful, love yourself, feel a sense of unity with your world, your 
community and yourself, and of course respect yourself, what else could you 
need? It all comes full circle in the end, and it always comes back to *you*.

heart,
Alida

WOOHOO!!!!  It's SOOOOOOOO Nice to see the Southbay Junglist Crew soooooo lively as I did tonite at Clandestine @ Kleidon's Lounge in San Jose.   It was soooooooo Great to get out and hear some Awesome Jungle Beats after about 4 months of just School, Work and Horses.  WOW!!!!  I needed to dance away all the stress that This semester put me through.  I went to the club with a huge headache and being sooooooooo tired, and i actually left wide awake with no headache at all.  

Proxy, JuJu, 4Real, and Robbliss really tore it up tonite, as their really hard Drum N Bass Beats bringing out the Junglists and Breakers out onto the floor.  Thanks Killasubz for Hosting an Awesome night after finals for me.  I needed this.  What a way to end the semester!!!  Nity-Nite ALL!!!  The Daisyjunglist is BACK!!!!!!

too much of a big deal has been made of  age difference among couples--   one 
day as that mid life crisis is about to hit and my patience is running thin 
and money is unable to cure my loneliness, ill definitely be out there 
searching for my perfect dream trophy wife who surely will not be older than 
24.   There is no better cure for the blues than sex with a woman half your 
age with perfect slender tanned thighs, long hair,  and great sexy lips.

Hey there, does anyone know anything about the SomArts Gallery where the Tantra party will be? Just kinda wondering what the space is like, sounds like a good party though! I'm definitely on the lookout for gatherings OTHER than PNY...are any UGs coming up for NYE that someone would let a nice, fun Oakland girl know about?? ;-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Tantra party

SomArts is a kick ass space. 2 large rooms and a smaller middle room.
Sometimes they setup an outdoor tent which in the past turns into the chill
room. First time i went there was when I worked the FnF No on Knight All
Night party. It was my first FnF party and I was impressed with the space.
It's a really great place to have a party and would highly recommend taking
a look at it. As for other ug parties I've only heard hushed whispers of
potential parties. Nothing definite.

Go to tahoe.
Enjoy the snow.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: that whole age and love thing

exactly n o t what alida was talking about...

quite frankly it is people with your viewpoint that reinforce the social 
stigma surrounding relationships with large age discrepencies.  your 
ideology is so universally detested that the general populous has deemed it 
completely unacceptable.  most are not even willing to conceed that there 
are couples out there in these relationships who *do* care for and love each 
other.

the conundrum is that if society accepts these relationships with open arms, 
it would entail giving people like you the benefit of the doubt that your 
are genuine.  you obviously are not genuine.  so essentially, to protect 
naive young women from being treated as objects by lascivious individuals 
like yourself, society is forced to shun these relationships.  you suck.

This is correct, we did place an open call for all Photographers for the last event. 
We are actually looking for a small handful of skilled photographers who are interested in capturing the event either by photo or video.
If this is something you are interested in please contact us by replying to this email and someone will go over all pertinant information with you.
Regards,
Coolworld

Also, it's run by the forces of good, so I doubt you'll be seeing any red
jacket security thugs. It's on Brannan, so it's easily accessible by
public transit.

Great space.

Subject: [sfraves] help me

I shall try to keep this short & simple.
My raving life began one fine evening in the later half of October of this 
year. And it has just gotten to be more beautiful and now is a very vital 
part of my life.
But my life has been pretty crazy lately. I was laid off last year and I 
have tried getting back on a student visa which was turned down recently. It 
breaks my heart to even think about leaving the country and leaving this 
life behind. I guess this is a desperate plea for help. I have had 
experience for over a year working with software(programming in Java)  and I 
have a masters in CS.
Of course I have been trying to find work, but havent had any luck. So I 
would also go for the next best thing. If I could find any non- computer 
related job for the immediate future and they could process a work visa for 
me, that would be awesome too.
So if you do happen to know or if anyone you know might know of something, 
please tell me.
If nothing happens, I fly out on the 11th of January.
Oh yeah, if you would like me to send you my resume, please do let me know.
thanks, (& my apologies to those who consider this as spam)

vj
p.s. sorry I did not attach an "nrr" to the subject line. I figured most 
people would routinely delete that stuff, because I do the same.

Ellen Burstyn got robbed blind by the Academy, she should have gotten the
Oscar for the Performance of the Decade for 'Requiem.'

Julia Roberts, my eye, and she KNOWS it.

Thank God, Aronofsky is directing the next Batman movie instead of that
Schumacher hack.

Hey Vishal ,its me Dustin. I recently saw you at Devotion and I still 
remember your first race at Neo Tokyo : ) The guy with the funny cap and the 
drive to dance without specific need for Dj hype. I dont know if you remember 
but at that Neo Tokyo party I was wearing hospital scrubs, that wasnt just a 
costume. I work in UCSF medical center. UCSF is both a college and a hospital 
and they have job postings on their web site, being a hospital this is the 
busy season. I know they are always hiring for several positions, some 
without prior experience. Theres some jobs that work with patients, some that 
dont, and some jobs that are in the school facilities that have nothing to do 
with hospital work. I've worked there three years now while I've been going 
to school part time. Theres lots of different cultures, age ranges, variety 
of travelling workers. An added bonus is that I have two family members who 
also work in the same facility, so if recommendations are needed just ask : ) 
 Basically I would suggest applying online for as many jobs as possible and 
posting a resume, but also I think you should pick up a real application at 
the Human resources offices. This is a little confusing because the HR office 
is at a sepearte campus, Mount Zion on Divisadero.  I'm pretty sure you could 
get directions and numbers online. Another way to go might be a temp service. 
I was first hired through a temp agency before I was an official employee of 
the hospital. In fact the temp agency, Kelly Services, is in the same Human 
Resources building on Divisadero. I hope all this info helped, my advice is 
to apply for every opportunity you see.

The best of luck Vish, 
Hope you can stay in Cali

Thanks a lot for going out and trying to help Vishal out.  It's been
awhile since I've met someone with such a pure heart and love for what
we have going on out here - and I'd hate to see him go. And the fact
that you offered to help him says a lot about you too.


By gosh, there's hope out there!!!

Oh- I thought it was after you bought the house they would cut it in 2
and move half of it far away- so you kinda only get half of what you

More ravers than not expected plead not guilty

Last Updated: Dec. 7, 2002

Racine - Unless things begin to turn around on Monday, the city's plan to 
settle 441 rave citation cases by cutting the fine is in trouble.

The first wave of the 441 people ticketed at a Nov. 2 rave made their 
initial appearance in Racine Municipal Court last week. Most of the people 
standing in line were waiting to plead not guilty and get another court date.

Micabil Diaz (left), legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union 
of Wisconsin, talks to people waiting to enter a plea in municipal court. 
So far, 19 people have accepted a deal to plead no contest and pay a lower 
fine.
By the Numbers
Most of the people who received city citations for attending a rave party 
and had their initial appearance in Racine Municipal Court last week 
decided to fight the citation rather than accept a reduction in fines to 
$100 from $968.

The rest of those cited will have their initial court appearances on Monday 
or on Dec. 16.
18a43b.jpg441: People issued citations for being an "inmate of a disorderly 
house"
18a45d.jpg206: People scheduled last week for initial Municipal Court 
appearance
18a477.jpg147: Pleaded not guilty
18a48b.jpg40: Did not appear in court; will be convicted
18a4a0.jpg19: Pleaded no contest and agreed to pay $100 fine.

A storm of denunciation descended upon city officials after it was revealed 
that police had issued $968 municipal tickets to young adults attending a 
Nov. 2 rave, a party known for distinctive dance music and, oftentimes, 
illegal drug use.

Even city officials who supported the crackdown said the fine was too high.

In response, the city attorney's office offered to reduce the fine to $100 
for anyone who pleaded no contest to being an "inmate of a disorderly 
house." But when the first wave of those ticketed made their initial 
appearance in Municipal Court last week, only 19 of 206 took the deal.

If that trend continues on Monday and on Dec. 16, when the rest of those 
cited will make their initial court appearances, the city could be facing 
the costly prospect of hundreds of trials - or dismissing the citations en 
masse.

Assistant City Attorney Scott Lewis said he won't know what will happen 
until after the second round of court hearings that begin Dec. 18, when 
people who pleaded not guilty appear for pretrial conferences.

At that time, Lewis said, he will be able to assess how strong the evidence 
is and decide how to proceed.

With the sheer numbers involved, "I admit I'm placed in a very difficult 
position here," Lewis said.

The plea bargain obviously offered a substantial fine reduction, but many 
of those cited said last week that they refused the deal because they had 
done nothing wrong. They pointed out that only three men were arrested on 
drug charges, but everyone at the party received the municipal citation, 
regardless of how long they had been at the party or other factors.

"Basically you're guilty by association and the Constitution says you can't 
do that," said Racine attorney Erik Guenther, who is representing some of 
those who were cited.

Even those who might have considered paying the $100 to be done with the 
case decided against the plea bargain because the citation includes a 
reference to controlled substances. Although a municipal citation is far 
less serious than a criminal charge, no one wanted to have a drug-related 
offense on their record, and many were girding for a fight.

"I think we'll win. Everybody I talked to is on our side," said Laura 
Maurer, 21, of Waukesha, who plans to enter her not-guilty plea Monday.

"I feel if everybody pleads not guilty, it will get thrown out," added Kurt 
Bohman, 27, who performed as "DJ Simple" at the rave and drove six hours 
from his Minneapolis home to plead not guilty last week. "It will clog up 
the court system. It already has."

Court officials had expected no more than 100 people would plead not guilty 
last week and were unable to immediately schedule a pretrial conference for 
about half of them. The hallway outside the court clerk's office was filled 
with those pleading not guilty, many sporting multiple body piercings and a 
few who brought their toddlers.

Ald. John Engel, chairman of the Common Council's Public Safety and 
Buildings Committee, said he agreed with offering to reduce the fines, but 
said it was important that police took a hard line at the rave party in 
order to discourage future raves. He said such parties are known for 
illegal drug use and illegal drugs were found at the Racine party, which 
was held at the Tradewinds tavern.

"Are we turning into a rigid, hard-nosed community? I don't think so," 
Engel said.

Engel and other city officials acknowledged that one of the aims of the 
crackdown was to discourage anyone from ever holding another rave in 
Racine. It might have worked.

"I would never come down here again," said Joseph Johnson, 25, of Milwaukee.

Daniel Kushner, 23, of Chicago, who like Johnson pleaded not guilty last 
week, said the popularity of raves had been on the decline, partly because 
of the law enforcement crackdowns, which usually result in raves being shut 
down and party-goers being sent home.

"The golden era of the scene has passed," he said. "They've worn us down 
pretty well. There's no 'us' anymore."

Even city officials who supported the crackdown said the fine was too high.<br><br>
In response, the city attorney's office offered to reduce the fine to $100 for anyone who pleaded no contest to being an &quot;inmate of a disorderly house.&quot; But when the first wave of those ticketed made their initial appearance in Municipal Court last week, only 19 of 206 took the deal.<br><br>

With the sheer numbers involved, &quot;I admit I'm placed in a very difficult position here,&quot; Lewis said.<br><br>
The plea bargain obviously offered a substantial fine reduction, but many of those cited said last week that they refused the deal because they had done nothing wrong.

Court officials had expected no more than 100 people would plead not guilty last week and were unable to immediately schedule a pretrial conference for about half of them. The hallway outside the court clerk's office was filled with those pleading not guilty, many sporting multiple body piercings and a few who brought their toddlers.<br><br>
Ald. John Engel, chairman of the Common Council's Public Safety and Buildings Committee, said he agreed with offering to reduce the fines, but said it was important that police took a hard line at the rave party in order to discourage future raves. He said such parties are known for illegal drug use and illegal drugs were found at the Racine party, which was held at the Tradewinds tavern.<br><br>
&quot;Are we turning into a rigid, hard-nosed community? I don't think so,&quot; Engel said.<br><br>
Engel and other city officials acknowledged that one of the aims of the crackdown was to discourage anyone from ever holding another rave in Racine. It might have worked.<br><br>
&quot;I would never come down here again,&quot; said Joseph Johnson, 25, of Milwaukee.<br><br>
Daniel Kushner, 23, of Chicago, who like Johnson pleaded not guilty last week, said the popularity of raves had been on the decline, partly because of the law enforcement crackdowns, which usually result in raves being shut down and party-goers being sent home.<br><br>

I posted this elsewhere and it turned out better than

share it here.

I'll try.

The way the legal game works in this country, is that
if you're 'in the dock' there's a lot of verbiage
around your rights as a citizen, but the reality is is
that the average defendant is so pressed by the weight
of the proceedings that most are *expected* to plead
out.

In other words, cave in, roll over, assume the
position....=20

It's called 'being bullied.'

because to REALLY stick up for yourself, once things
have gotten this far, is a life upside down turning
hassle, and despite the lip service given to the
'presumption of innocence' everyone around you that's
important to you will assume the worst.

that's just hella stressful, and most people in this
position just say fuck it, it's not worth it, what's
the fine so i can get the fuck out of here, so it's
*expected* that most will just give up and avoid all
that *petty* static and just quit and go back and get
on with their lives.

this is why this case is so extraordinary, it's not
just one or two people doing this, but by now,
HUNDREDS who have found the inner strength to say
BASTA, enough, this is BULLSHIT and I'm going to
follow it through to the end, no matter what the
personal cost.

Nothing like strength in numbers, eh?

Shove shit down my throat?

Here's some back, I hope you choke.

Which, btw, the DA's office in Racine is doing on this
one, god bless 'em, they signed up for this, now let
them do their jobs, hope they all get the stress boils
they're used to giving instead of getting.

Nothing I like more than the sound of a bully's
petard being hoisted, and hoisted high.

Eminem knows all about this, his whole last album has
this as its theme, which explains why he's moved so
many units, because he's not the only one that's had
enough of this time wasting crap that accomplishes
nothing except to steal value and productivity from
good people that want nothing more to just enjoy their
lives.

He's singing about it, and god bless, these people are
actually *doing* something about it, it's about time.

btw, anyone born after 1990 will have no clue what
'presumption of innocence' means, since, thanks to
Poindexter and his TIA program, everything is going to
monitored from this time forward.=20

it's the ultimate bullying tactic and whine all you
want, it will not go away, get used to it and figure
out where to go from there.

nic


The real objective is human brotherhood.=20

This is widely felt to be the case, though it is not
usually said, or not said loudly enough.=20

Men use up their lives in heart-breaking political
struggles, or get themselves killed in civil wars, or
tortured in the secret prisons, not in order to
establish some central-heated, air-conditioned,
strip-lighted Paradise, but because they want a world
in which human beings love one another instead of
swindling and murdering one another.=20

And they want that world as a first step.=20

Where they go from there is not so certain, and the
attempt to foresee it in detail merely confuses the
issue.=20

Eric Blair, London, England, 1943

it's been 60 yrs, y hasn't this happened yet?=20

We have the technology.

I have a teleportation device if it will do you any good, but I've been 
stuck in this idiotic karmic cyclical belt since I crushed my DWG at a 
party ten years ago.  Tell me, Cheese, are you traveling back to the future 
or forward to the past?

what's new, huh? the weather this time of year is pretty darned deceiving.....let's not forget QUALITY when it comes to events.....QUALITY....the day there is quantitative QUALITY is the day that time stands still.  i'm just saying that....words without meaning are spelling contests and language arts classes and empty communications, hence all words actually have some sort of meaning.....do you think that all the girls should go totally public and bare all? i don't think sooooooooooooo. here's some meaning for your mental soup: there are tons of parties to be found, but lack luster or not, fondness is a treasure to be held onto. :)......most would rathered be kissed when desiring of a kiss....scoop up on the love'ins and try to hold back on the seething parts, as cute as they are. ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (bsp) Orgy

I went to one, at the request of friends and granted it was Christopher 
lawrence trance night.. It was mediocre.. There was some good Hip-hop DJ's 
outside laying down some ok stuff. DJ's were prety much all on for the night 
the crowd.. was not really my type.. I like a mix of cultures and faces when 
I go out, even though generally im there for the music and pay lil 
attetntion to crowd but there was no way of not noticing..

I don't want people to read my post a wrong way so I will just leave it at 
that.

Was it worth $25 Fuck no it wasn't I would have had a better time staying 
home playing Mortal Kombat on PS2 or the new game splinter cell on Xbox.

unbelievable performance I've *EVER* been to. Phantom, Les Miz and other =
such acts all pale in comparison to Cirque Du Soleil. The amount of time =
and effort placed into the production was beyond anything I could =
fathom. The costumes, the makeup, the music, the amazing gymnastic =
feats... All of it left me in complete awe. I'm really at a loss for =
words. If you haven't gone you should. From all the people I know that =
have seen the Vegas performance they said the one in SF right now blows =
it away. By far one of my favorite things I saw was the mini hot air =
balloon with the digital video projector inside. They managed to rig a =
projector inside this floating balloon and have it project on the inside =
walls. The net result was a 360 degree projection on a sphere like =
surface. That was too damn cool. That and the opening sequence with the =
guy and the net. I'll stop now. GO. GO GO GO.

       I think i was at the Cirque De Soleil in San Jose a few years back... 
Remember when that one guy from the crowd participated in the show (the 
really short guy took off his shirt and ran off with it) ? Later on in the 
show, everyone in the crowd realized that he was part of the show. the show 
overall was pretty amazing...

The last time I went to Orgy a few months ago... it was that same ol'
"bro's n ho's" type crowd (my friend's description - and yes, Tami,
very Asian). I really didn't have that great of a time, until a couple
friends I knew showed up and danced with me. I will admit, Donald
Glaude was cool, but my roommate's DJ friend from Australia rocked it
harder than Glaude. 

THANK GAWD I GOT IN FREE! It wouldn't have even been worth $15 for me.

Cirque Du Soleil is truly an amazing performance of artistic, physical and creative feats beyond imagination. 
The one show that actually stands above the others, however, is "O" 
If you can make it to Vegas, that is truly the show to see.

Sorry, pet peeve, nerve hit.

You can say that because there were a lot of asians there, and it is a
fact, no? I love how it's un-PC to make assertions of fact if you're not
asian/gay/black/buddhist/whatever.

the most obvious and simple meaning is that the majority of the crowd was 
made up of asians.  I think the bro's and ho's atmosphere isn't what 
jessica was seeking, but I can't speak for her comfort.

k.i.s.s.

Boy... I love the way people misconstrue the words I type.
The "very Asian" statement Tami and I made was an OBSERVATION. It was
meant to mean there were a lot of Asian people attending the party. And
the "bro's n ho's" is just another observation... a clubby-type crowd. 

Goodness... and it's not like I was uncomfortable... I was just not in
my element. 

What a freakin day... I vote to ban Thursdays like this. The whole day
has sucked.

I'm going back to my quiet, dark, little hole on SFR and won't post.

Just so you know, I just got off chat with Jessica.  I esplained to her that I didn't misconstrue her words.  Once when I was stationed in Texas, I walked into a bar with some buddies of mine.  All of them were Caucasian but me.  And there were a bunch of guys with cowboy hats wearing big buckles hanging out in the bar.  One of them walked past me and sang the line from that Sesame Street song, "One of these things is not like the others..."  That made me feel VERY uncomfortable and mad!!!  Just because other people act like sheep and dress alike and follow each other around doesn't mean that other people are wrong because they don't act like sheep.I just wanted to know if she felt uncomfortable, that's all.By the way, I did make her day a little bit better :)  YAY!!Frank--- Jessica McMahan  wrote:> Boy...

Try going out of the country :) It's a different world out there. We're

Kevin Parish - LIVE PA Kevin makes music that gives to almost all types =
of electronic music. Past live shows have been any combination of live =
pop karaoke to his own pop songs, weird noise played on Nord, and =
electronic music with beats. His singing voice invokes a hodgepodge of =
emotions. There is usually an element of sarcastic humor in the music, =
and in the lyrics for the pop songs... "Your tax dollars pay to keep =

feature the distinctive touches of luminaries such as John McEntire and =
Doug McCombs of Tortoise, Eric Matthews, Andy Chase as well as Jim =

TEMP - LIVE PA In addition to working on solo projects and hosting their =
***TrashAmerica events, Kevin Parish and Skip Found Teli make music =
together. Kevin's pop sensibility and Skip Found Teli's aptitude for =

simplistic melody and harmonic tension in a tribute to =
musical/mechanical innvovators of the 20th century. Look for T.E.M.P. =

Subject: [sfraves] cool hiphop song nrr

i don't know whose work this is, but it is just the
coolest...there's this dude singing/talking about
meeting this cool chick when he was out, and then she
comes in singing the chorus: "whatcha gonna do when
your son is at home....crying all alone on the bedroom
floor, cuz he's hungry......and his daddy's gone..." i
don't know who wrote it, produced it, but it makes me
want to go out and hear more hiphop instead of
questioning whether or not there will ever be anymore
hiphop to be heard. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] S.U.N. Project.....

Hi Amber and all of you that joined us for another SCORCHING performance by
the S.U.N. Project!

It's Thursday and we're just now recovered from an amazing last saturday
night with Sun Project, dutch, maxx, uphonic, masonic, michael anthony,
b.smiley, irina, and toires.  wow.

thank you to everyone that contributed their energy and positive vibrations
to one hell of a night!  the dancefloor on both levels was packed with happy
people going for it.  nice to have you all along for the journey!

Sun Project are truly unique among any techno or trance artists.  If you had
seen them before, or if it was your first time, it was another
mind-blowing-full-on performance.  we thank Sun Project profusely for flying
all this way just for our (((THUMP))) party - their only US appearance in
2002.

we've finally fired up the FORUMS again on our site so if you want to join
in the discussion about the sun project party, or any thing else about our
radio shows, parties, gear, whatever, check em out on our site:
http://www.thumpradio.com/forums.cfm

finally, get ready for another great (((THUMP))) on 1.1.03 with Olli Wisdom
of Spacetribe fame - one of the best full-on producers and 5th dimension of
trance navigators on the planet!  olli rips!

    mmmmm. . .=20

        i know what you're thinking. . . but anyway. . . : )


    So i've been workin on my car a ton lately (weather permitting). ..  =
i have a reg old civic sohc vtec, 2 dr, 99, etc etc. . . and I seized =
the motor a couple weeks or so ago. i'm just not easy on stuff usually. =
. . so I figure, if it broke, then i gotta make it so it won't, not like =
i need to be more gentle. . . that's not really me. . . no fun either. . =
.=20
    So I've really been looking for a Skunk2 cam, gear (not really =
needed now but if I found one I'd buy it), I want skunk  valve springs n =
Ti retainers, and skunk valves. Since I've pretty much torn my entire =
lil car apart, I've already ported my heads, I should have some mugen =
headers sometime soon, I'm about to clean up my intake manifold (damn =
stock casting work). . .
I "may" need new pistons, I saw some type-r ones I can prolly get for =
not too much. My guess is I cracked one also, rings should be replaced =
regardless, but I'll see if some piston sets kinda fall into my lap =
anytime soon.
    exhaust is easy. . . simple race cat, n bomb exit, or something =
similar (maybe APEXi or Skunk). . . I neeeeeeeeeeed a new ecu, skunk or =
apexi most likely, but I've found some vtec controllers I might pick up. =

    I am looking for skunk parts tho, stage 2. . . it's such a bitch =
getting sohc parts in most places, and in others they just charge =
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much. seriously, like 550 for a single cam. . =
. i bet I can get it for less than half that. . . I'd like to have a =
better relation with my local shop y'know. . . but if I do everything =
myself and get everything for less than they could give it to me. . . =
well, they're good for comparison I suppose.
  =20
    I'm still working on some adj. coilovers so I could make up the sag =
from my stereo, possibly a fatter rotor kit, some carbon pieces (front =
lip, rear lip, hood, this and that). . . I know I'll fry my clutch =
within a month or so after I get everything together. Cars are so simple =
to work on. . . I'm about to have my other truck fixed (chevy of =
course), and i'm thinking about a cage n racing my lil honda. . . not =
drag tho, like course, track, autocross, whatever. . . i'm not exactly =
prepared for it yet, but I still have my race itch from motocross, but I =
kinda need use of parts I tend to break. . .=20

    but yeah. . .  if anyone has any info on skunk2 stage 2 engine =
components for a sohc vtec civic. . . then get back to me. . .=20

    i never left this list either. . . my laptop just died, and I didn't =
have any choice but to get another (which should have been here today). =
. . and most of my off time's been spent setting my finances up for some =
things I knew were coming up. . . damn I'm happy I did that. . .=20

    hope all is well. . . stuffs all mutherfuckin wonderful here. . .=20

Thursday, December 19, 2002 ** GZA **

Mystery Machine Productions presents GZA, Plus J-Live and Casual.
Lyrical swordsman GZA/Genius wields the microphone with a killer kung fu
grip and spits out lyrics faster than light speed turbo overdrive. This
Staten Island native comes with the goods that true hip-hop heads love to
hear - raw, dirty beats and airtight lyrics. A hardcore artist who deals
with subjects of guns, drugs, and the ghetto, GZA presents his
well-disciplined flow with double-edged rhymes and lyrical precision.
GZA started bustin' rhymes as a kid with his younger cousins Prince Rakeem
the RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard to eventually form what would become known
as the Wu-Tang Clan. With GZA leading this loose collective of MCs,
including Ol' Dirty Bastard, RZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah,
U-God, Inspecta Deck and Masta Killa, the Clan soon became hip-hop's
reigning monks of doom. But the grandfather of the Clan set himself apart
from the pack with his original style, flow and lyrical content. He's not
only a very mysterious Wu member but also a sharp one standing alone in
hip-hop's lyrical population as a unique voice. 21+.

Thursday, December 19, 2002 ** Weekly: Kit Kat **

(Every Thursday Night) - Kit Kat introduced the weekly party concept to
San Francisco in March 1989 and against all odds established itself as the
only Thursday night party worthy of a monster sweat. Today Kit Kat sits on
a Richter proof funk foundation which is shaken to the core by local
fanatics determined to dance their ass off. This party has inexplicably
managed to elude the weekend warrior virus and has a balls to the wall
energy behind it. By default The End Up provides a comfortable who cares
what you are wearing atmosphere, so all attitude inevitably gets checked
at the door. The party gets started right away and peaks when the local
after hour posse swings on to the dance floor and pushes the elevator
above cloud line in the nick of closing time.

The knobs are manhandled by resident DJ Marc Jellybear whom in turn passes
the closing baton to rotating guests Simon, Garth, Miguel Migs, Jonene,
Wyatt Earp & John Howard. In addition the club hosts monthly special
events with the next level of over hyped DJs that have been, however,
thoroughly Kit Kat tested and do in the end justify having to pass the hat
around for business class airfare.

Overall a guaranteed must call in sick in the next few hours experience.

Mystery Machine Productions presents...Soulive Plus DJ Logic and Lettuce

Soulive is a band whose time has come. This groovy combo are trailblazers
in defining a new branch of the Hip-Hop tree. Their flawless sound fluidly
combines the soul and jazz of the past with the inventive sound of today's
hip-hop, dub, funk, and dance music. As a result, this New York City trio
is a melting pot of jazzy harmonies, soul drenched ballads, hip-hop
rhythms, and no-nonsense funk. But it is Soulive's raucous live
performances that have earned them a devoted legion of fans few of their
contemporaries can brag about. They have sold out clubs across the nation
and show no signs of letting up soon.

Be sure to check out Soulive a.k.a. "the Greatest Band In The World" as
they kick off 2003 at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco with DJ Logic and
Lettuce. DJ Logic will join Soulive after sitting in with Government Mule
the night before at the Beacon Theater in New York!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] S.U.N. Project.....

Yes! SUN Project was ROARING last weekend. It happened the same night as
moksha so I had to do a kinda party hopping thing since there was no way
I could miss either party. Even at 5AM when I just had to leave DNA and
pass out the place was still a frenzy of effervescent energy.  

I know that I was scared for ((Thump)) when you all moved to DNA from
550, however I am glad to say that from the wonderful experiences I have
received for the last 4 or 5 months now my faith in you guys has been
100% restored.

Thanks Brian, et al ;)

WENT TO A PARTY, MOM

(please read all the way to the bottom and sign your name)

I went to a party, And remembered what you said. 

You told me not to drink, 

Mom So I had a Sprite instead.

I felt proud of myself, The way you said I would, That I didn't drink and drive, 

Though some friends said I should.

I made a healthy choice, And your advice to me was right, 

The party finally ended, And the kids drove out of sight.

I got into my car, Sure to get home in one piece, 

I never knew what was coming, 

Mom Something I expected least.

Now I'm lying on the pavement, 

And I hear the police-man say, 

The kid that caused this wreck was drunk, 

Mom, his voice seems far away. 

My own blood's all around me, As I try hard not to cry. 

I can hear the paramedic say, This girl is going to die. 

I'm sure the guy had no idea, While he was flying high, 

Because he chose to drink and drive, Now I would have to die.

So why do people do it, Mom? Knowing that it ruins lives? 

And now the pain is cutting me, Like a hundred stabbing knives. 

Tell sister not to be afraid, Mom.  Tell daddy to be brave, 

And when I go to heaven, Put Daddy's Girl on my grave.

Someone should have taught him, 

That its wrong to drink and drive. 

Maybe if his parents had, I'd still be alive. 

My breath is getting shorter, Mom I'm getting really scared. 

These are my final moments, And I'm so unprepared. 

I wish that you could hold me Mom,

As I lie here and die. I wish that I could say, 

" I love you, Mom!" So I love you and good-bye.

Mom, I hit that party and remembered what you said.
You told me not to drink a beer, so I had nine instead.

I felt so proud of myself cause I didn't even wince,
when I chased the last Corona down with gin and rumplemintz.

I made a healthy choice Mom, my reason it was sound,
but I started to feel dizzy when I looked down at the ground.

I couldn't walk, could barely talk, but found the strength to drink,
another round of Stoli and some water from the sink.

Instead of driving home drunk (which is really rather far).
I got beaten up by lesbians, then threw up on the bar.

So the bouncers threw me out, and I spent the night in jail,
but at least I didn't go home buzzed, or forward this email.

Subject: [sfraves] High rants of the AntiTuX, Part 1

Hrm, well, I'm leaving the bay area soon. I got laid-off from netscape 
last wednesday. It was a great job. I loved it, and I learned alot. 
Anyhow, I'm gonna be moving to phoenix, and do the college thing. It's 
actually going to be an experience for me, being as I didn't even 
graduate high school, or get my GED.

I moved out here when I was 18. I was newly married, and had just taken 
a job at netscape as the head sysadmin of iPlanet learning solutions. 
That job sent me all over the world, filled my passport with stamps, and 
taught me more about how things *REALLY* work in a business than any 
schooling could. I was forced to mature quickly, and adapt to all that 
which life threw at me.

All these great things, have happened to me since I moved out here. My 
daughter was born, I was able to finally pay off all my debts, and I met 
a great group of friends in the rave community. I learned that the only 
person who can really help someone is themselves, and no matter what you 
care, you can't change, or help anyone. The only person that can help 
someone is themselves, and all you can do is give them the tools to 
solve their own problems.

I've also had terrible things happen to me since I moved here. I lost my 
wife to a divorce, and have been fighting for custody of my little girl 
for the last few months. I've been hosed by roommates on rent, 5 days 
before it was due, dealt with depression, and even tried to commit 
suicide once, because of these.

All these lessons taught me something I never really realized until I 
lost everything that I held dear. I realized that the tech industry 
isn't for me, and that I'm much better at helping people than I am at 
fixing, coding on, or just doing generic work with computers. I realized 
that the reason I got into the tech industry wasn't because it was a 
labor of love, but because it was something that boosted my ego, and 
made me feel good. Kinda funny for a kid who dropped out of high school 
when he was in 11th grade, and never got his GED.

In the last few months, through all the turmoil I've gone through, I've 
found some sort of inner-peace, which helped me grow as a person. I 
think I've matured and grown as a person to such a point I'm ready to 
take that next step. Meditation, dancing, and working on the abilities 
that the gods gave me have really helped me move beyond the depressions, 
fears, and doubts in my life.

I'm going to go back to live with my parents, go to college, and do a 
double-major in philosophy and phsychology. With the tools I get with 
those, I'll be able to better understand myself, and be able to help 
those who are struggling with their own personal demons. I'm already the 
emotional rock which a lot of people come to, but through hard work and 
my own personal growth, I'll be able to handle it much better.

I don't know what type of rave community is out in the phoenix, arizona 
area, but I'm looking forward to joining it, and maybe bringing some of 
the joy and peace that I was given out here, there.

I don't have a concrete date for when I'm going to leave, but it'll 
definitely be by the end of january. I want to go there, get a car 
(which I haven't had), get a nice job, and get everything in order so I 
can enroll in college and begin training to fulfill my life's dream of 
helping others figure out how to help themselves.

Everyone I've spoken to about leaving has been so supportive, and I've 
picked up some great advice on how to begin this journey. Emotionally, 
spirtually, and mentally, I know I'm ready. I've already hit 
rock-bottom, so the only place I can go from here is up. :)

Anyhow, drop me a line if you want to hang out, or just chat sometime 
about random stuff. Also, if you have any insight into the community out 
there in that area, please let me know. I would love to hook up with 
some great crews out there, and continue sharing the love I recieved 
from you all.

It's definitely been a an adventure, and I look forward to seeing where 
this ride is going to take me next..

thanks tim - thank you for giving us the time and opportunity to transition

we have some AMAZING memories (and DATs!) from those years, but the DNA

was a tough year but we made it thanks to all of your support.

best wishes to everyone for a peaceful and prosperous 2003!  we have some
WICKED line-ups waiting for you...some of the best classic bands and some
new acts that are taking trance to the next level.  quality full-on music.

for now, bring on SPACETRIBE!!  "would 54 bass drums satisfy you?"

(Big Love Show), Mehrshad (Super Happy Fun Music Show), and friends, will
be the hosts on your 30-hour journey.

ABOUT THE MARATHON:

The Winter Solstice Music Marathon began in 1992 with a 24-hour event that
showcased some of the first DJs to play house/acid-house music in the San
Francisco underground.  Those DJs included now-legedary DJs such as Spun,
Rick Preston, Tony, Garth, and Jeno.  We are proud, ten years later, to be
continuing in the tradition of the first marathon.

ABOUT KZSU:

KZSU, 90.1FM, Stanford, is one of the Bay Area's leading college radio
stations.  We have a long tradition of broadcasting independent music, and
the Winter Solstice Marathon is one example of our efforts to represent
non-commercial music to the airwaves.  Our station can be heard in many
parts of the East Bay (Oakland, Hayward, Castro Valley, Fremont) and
Peninsula (San Mateo, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, and some parts of
San Jose & San Francisco) on your dial at 90.1FM.  We are also a leading
Internet-streaming station - please visit http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

  Got the whole house to my self on Christmas day, so if anyone who has no 
place to kick it or just want to come by your more than welcome!
  Bring food, drinks or snacks and I'll have food too and open tables for 
those in the mood to throw down some vinyl, just a chill Chrismas day.
  Hit me back with a RSVP so I'll know what to expect. I live in Oakland near 
 Foothill blvd, between the East Lake and Fruitvale districts.
  Peace and blessings to all, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Hi there, guys!

    I was wondering if anyone else has had success with the AvantGo
channel for the calendar?  I've allocated as much as 400KB in my
account for the channel and it still comes back as too large.  The
txt file of the calendar is only 40KB...any ideas on what I might be
doing wrong?
    I think that its an awesome idea for the calendar, and really
convenient for me....Thanks!

Yeah, i have to say I was kinda disappointed by this email as well.
Spamming people that are supposedly wanting to "keep up with his life" is
seriously weak.

at the assault of their loved ones at the hands of its minions:

Subject: [sfraves] Cirque Du Soliel = les miz, phantom

There are better shows  than  Cirque Du Soliel, though none with such
professional polish.
I think the "polish" is what put them on the top.

San Francisco is fast becoming a circus town ( in the worlds eyes). And
right now circus and cabaret is what is happening in the non-dance
underground.

In fact,  Circus has leaked over into the dance party environment.

Check out  Transister, Zenodrome, Mystic Family Circus,  for a fine mix of
vinyl and electronic beats along with  burgeoning circus performers.

If you prefer underground music parties to massive music parties, than you
will prefer zenodrome or Mystic to Cirque any day of the week.


For those of you that are promoters looking for something different, check
into the burgeoning SF Circus scene. Them kids need the money. Lots of it.

Also, don't forget the Anon Salon a sort of "self authored" circus of
weirdness that's been going strong for over ten years.  Spoonman is the evil
genius behind the salon and he's a really interesting fellow.  I met him
through the WELL a long long time ago.

Before there was Burning Man there was Anon Salon...

Happy holidays,

                                 THE PERFECT GIFT

  I asked for MORE free time so I could do a lot of things,
  I was given PATIENCE so I would finish.

  I asked for MORE talents so I could do wonderful things,
  I was given MINDFULLNESS so I would do the best things.

  I asked for MORE power and MORE authority to do greater things,
  I was given WISDOM so I could do better things.

  I asked for MORE oppertunities so I could get ahead,
  I was given JOY so I would like tomorrow.

  I asked for MORE THINGS with the promise this will be the last time,
  I was given SATISFACTION so I would be free.

  I asked for a BETTER job and a BETTER relationship,
  I was given FAITH so I would make a commitment.

  I asked for the "GOOD LIFE" so I could be happy,
  I was given LOVE so life would be worth living.

  I asked for LESS stress in my life so I could live better,
  I was given PEACE so I could start living now.

  I asked for the FREEDOM to be told not what to do and not what to have,
  I was given KINDNESS so I would have no regreats.
     From a card I found on BART


Peace and love to all of you, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Aye, it's a damn shame... Rest in Peace, Joe.

[although there is one part of the article I'll go ahead and disagree with,

"Should I Stay or Should I Go" being used for Stoli ads, and "London
Calling" for a Jaguar ad campaign.]

i've got both Cool Edit Pro and Sound Forge 6 and i am trying to record =
an audio signal from my VCR.

I have a dongle that splits the two channels from the VCR that plugs =
into my sound card in either the 'Line' or 'Microphone' plug.

I get clean sound when I run the signal through the 'Line' plug, no =
problem, but neither program finds to the siganl to record it.

When I run the signal through the Microphone plug it comes through but =
sound really bad.

Any suggestions?

I've got a VCR tape with all the taling Heads albums on it and i want to =
put them on my hard drive so i can burn CD's from them.

Thanks.

A POLITICALLY CORRECT "Twelve Days of Christmas" from Fraser Clark:

On the 12th day of Xmas - I mean the Eurocentrically imposed midwinter 
festival,
My Significant Other in a consenting adult, monogamous relationship
Gave to me...

TWELVE males reclaiming their inner warrior through ritual drumming,

ELEVEN pipers piping (plus an 18-member pit orchestra made up of members in 
good standing of the Musicians Equity Union as called for in their contract 
even though they won't be asked to play a note),

TEN melanin deprived, testosterone-poisoned scions of the patriarchal 
ruling class system a'leaping,

NINE persons engaged in rhythmic self-expression,

EIGHT economically disadvantaged female persons stealing milk-products from 
enslaved Bovine-Americans,

SEVEN endangered swans swimming on federally protected wetlands,

SIX enslaved Fowl-Americans producing stolen non-human animal products,

FIVE golden symbols of culturally sanctioned enforced domestic incarceration,

(NOTE: after members of the Animal Liberation Front threatened to throw red 
paint at our computer, the calling birds, French hens and partridge have 
been reintroduced to their native habitats. To avoid further 
Animal-American enslavement, the remaining gift package has been revised.)

FOUR hours of recorded whale songs

THREE deconstructionist poets

TWO Sierra Club calendars printed on recycled processed tree carcasses

AND a Spotted Owl activist chained to an old-growth pear tree!

I'm assuming you're running Windows...

Take a look at the mixer app, either the one that comes with Windows
(attached to the main volume control) or one that comes with your sound
card. There should be configuration options for setting the levels of the
various inputs, as well as turning them off and on. You should be
recording off the line in, if you are not getting a signal there it means
that you probably have the line in muted.

As far as burning CD's of Talking Heads albums, it'll probably be easier
(and sound better) if you download the tracks as mp3 and burn from those.
Just be sure to get 192k or higher encodings.

thanks, i actually figured this out right after I sent out this request,
doh.

True, but it's a high end recording on the VCR and i've got everything on
one tape, including 'The Name of This band Is Talking Heads" which is out of
print.

I already set it to 192 kbps, but thanks for the heads up, if you have any
other suggestions i'd love to hear them.

Thanks,

nic

Which ones? Judging by the line-up it looks like house and... erm, hard
house? Or hardcore, maybe techno? Regardless... Two genres of music
under one roof? It's pure madness, man! Never been done before!

I don't really see the point in naming an event "I'll Play What I
Want!!!" if you're limiting yourself to specific genres. Why not host
DJ's with wildly varying tastes, or even (gasp!) encourage your DJ's to
*play different types of music*? Why even bother mentioning genres in
your BSP (which, btw, you forgot to mention in your subject line)?

I play tech-house and techno... does that count as 2 genres? >:)

And on that note:

A Politically Correct Seasons Greetings

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---

Best wishes for an environmentally conscious, socially responsible, low
stress, non-addictive, gender-neutral, winter solstice holiday, practiced
within the most joyous traditions of the religious persuasion of your choice
, but with respect for the religious persuasion of others who choose to
practice their own religion as well as those who choose not to practice a
religion at all; plus...

A fiscally successful, personally fulfilling, and medically uncomplicated
recognition of the generally accepted calendar year 2003, but not without
due respect for the calendars of choice of other cultures whose
contributions have helped make our society great, without regard to the
race, creed color, religious, or sexual preferences of the wishes.

Disclaimer: This greeting is subject to clarification or withdrawal. It
implies no promise by the wisher to actually implement any of the wishes for
her/himself or others and no responsibility for any unintended emotional
stress these greetings may bring to those not caught up in the holiday
spirit.


Found this the other day while coming up with a lesson plan to teach my
preschoolers about Winter Solstice and thought it was amusing

A POLITICALLY CORRECT "Twelve Days of Christmas" from Fraser Clark:

On the 12th day of Xmas - I mean the Eurocentrically imposed midwinter
festival,
My Significant Other in a consenting adult, monogamous relationship
Gave to me...

TWELVE males reclaiming their inner warrior through ritual drumming,

ELEVEN pipers piping (plus an 18-member pit orchestra made up of members in
good standing of the Musicians Equity Union as called for in their contract
even though they won't be asked to play a note),

TEN melanin deprived, testosterone-poisoned scions of the patriarchal
ruling class system a'leaping,

NINE persons engaged in rhythmic self-expression,

EIGHT economically disadvantaged female persons stealing milk-products from
enslaved Bovine-Americans,

SEVEN endangered swans swimming on federally protected wetlands,

SIX enslaved Fowl-Americans producing stolen non-human animal products,

FIVE golden symbols of culturally sanctioned enforced domestic
incarceration,

(NOTE: after members of the Animal Liberation Front threatened to throw red
paint at our computer, the calling birds, French hens and partridge have
been reintroduced to their native habitats. To avoid further
Animal-American enslavement, the remaining gift package has been revised.)

FOUR hours of recorded whale songs

THREE deconstructionist poets

TWO Sierra Club calendars printed on recycled processed tree carcasses

AND a Spotted Owl activist chained to an old-growth pear tree!

Subject: [sfraves] Hobbits, Elves and Raves

--=====================_17654249==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Last night many of the Moksha Tribe collective went to see Lord of the 
Rings:  Twin Towers.

I was thinking after the film how nice it would be to live again in a world 
of elves, hobbits, walking trees and magical things. This morning I 
realized that we can, for the mind may live where it wants. One need not 
succumb to the banality and materialism of modern life. One can create 
one's own magik -- or, conversely, one's own hell.

The Ring Trilogy was an important part of the spiritual growth of my 
generation -- a revival of the epic form. Tolkein eloquently expressed the 
modern struggle of the body and soul against the spiritless forces of greed 
and power. Unambiguous evil is manifest in the epic. The evils we face in 
our own lives are far more subtle yet just as destructive.

For example, Xmas, both a pagan and Christian holiday, once meant the birth 
of hope and light in the darkness of the winter of the soul.  These days it 
seems to be defined by the level of consumption.  Will the retailers make 
their sales goals this holiday?  Have we, as patriotic Americans, fulfilled 
our obligations as consumers?  Some of us are unemployed.  Is our 
self-esteem vanquished in a construct that equates work with being and 
level of acquisition with status and self validation?

The armies of darkness are all around us.  But we need not succumb to 
them.  As Tolkein showed us, the struggle of the soul against materialism 
and the thirst for power is a daily event.  The victories of the soul and 
good are not usually rapid or easy.

The rave community is a magical tribe of elves and hobbits. I think we 
strive in our own little way to fight the mechanistic, materialistic evils 
of post-industrial civilization with our own swords and spells: music and 
dance. Ancient rites, facilitated by the humane use of technology = 
raves.  We have magik on our side.  As long as there are life-giving, 
soul-nourishing celebrations of music and dance the evil wizards of the 
world cannot ultimately prevail.

I wish you all a spirit-enriching holiday, and bright prospects for growth 
in the new year.  Be you hobbit or elf, you have the magik within to bring 
light to the dark world, ravers.

Much love,

Apollo

Are you shitting me? Some guy dies and all you can say is, "They DID sell 
out" ? Whether you meant offense or not, that's rude. I don't even liek the 
Clash, but, I am not gonna badmouth their dead drummer. Just because a song 
is used for an ad campaign, doesn't equate them to selling out.

I remeber some comment about from last week on the Moby attack and how moby 
is quoted as being a "techno" artist, which you disagreed with. Who made you 
the Industry Nazi? Should I pass my demos through you for classification 
before I release them? Maybe I could tatoo it on my arm.

As well you shouldn't - considering Joe Strummer, while his name rhymes with

played guitar.  Damn well, I might add. The drummer, "Topper" Headon, is

That's open to interpretation. Considering the band themselves are (were?)
pretty anti-commercialism/capitalism, I'd say it was selling out.  (See

Yeah, I remember clearly. I stated that I was deeply saddened by the

I'm not a big fan of the holidays. The season is overrated and has lost any
meaning for me. I find myself contantly wishing that I could just skip
forward a few weeks and be done with it all. It's not so much that I'm a
Scrooge, but more about how I can't stand the false *peace on earth and good
will to men* crap that gets thrown about this time of year. It's the same
thing as running around and saying *plur*  Either you do it because it's a
part of who you are or you don't. If you feel morally obligated to be nice
this time of year and emody some *plur* like attitude, don't. It's not real.
Instead think about how you can change your life so that you truly believe
in some good will and peace on earth. Make it so that it's a part of your
daily life rather than an imposed attitude for a few weeks a year. If that
doesn't work for you then carry on as normal.

For me the holidays symbolize bling bling cash money yo. I enjoy doing
little things for friends all year long. I think that is more true than any
*holiday spirit* that gets tossed about. I participate regardless, but I
wish that it didn't feel so plastic fake to me. With that I say happy
holidays and welcome in the longer days as the winter solstice has passed.
It's all down hill from here.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Creating sound files from an outside source

If you're running an SB Live or similar card you need to select the
recording source. In the sblive mixer you can shoose what input you're
recording from. If you choose *what you hear* it will take every input and
any effects and record that. You merely need to select the line in as your
recording input. It seems you figured this out already though. Never use a
mic input for a line level input. The mic input has a preamp gain on it and
will distort the hell out of the line level signal.

thanks, i actually figured this out right after I sent out this request,

True, but it's a high end recording on the VCR and i've got everything on
one tape, including 'The Name of This band Is Talking Heads" which is out of
print.

I already set it to 192 kbps, but thanks for the heads up, if you have any
other suggestions i'd love to hear them.

Thanks,

I'm assuming you're running Windows...

Take a look at the mixer app, either the one that comes with Windows
(attached to the main volume control) or one that comes with your sound
card. There should be configuration options for setting the levels of the
various inputs, as well as turning them off and on. You should be
recording off the line in, if you are not getting a signal there it means
that you probably have the line in muted.

As far as burning CD's of Talking Heads albums, it'll probably be easier
(and sound better) if you download the tracks as mp3 and burn from those.
Just be sure to get 192k or higher encodings.

Piece Of Earth

By Oscar Gonzalez, AlterNet
December 23, 2002

Washington, DC (Neuters) =96 Concerned that messages of love and peace may=
 be=20
hampering its War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration is calling on=20
Americans during this holiday season to think "Piece Of Earth" instead of=20
"Peace On Earth."

According to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, "Peace is so=20
elusive, especially when you're not looking for it. So why not promote=20
something that you actually want =96 a piece of the Earth? Right now the=20
piece of Earth is Iraq, but it could apply nicely to any prime real estate=
=20
worth fighting for. Heck, I've got visions of Venezuela's oil fields=20
playing in my head even as we speak."

Mr. Rumsfeld also urged family members of US troops not to mail cards and=20
letters that mention peace.

"We don't want to confuse our soldiers about what their main mission is out=
=20
in the field. If you send cards, use a Sharpie to cross out love, peace,=20
and any other offending or unpatriotic words or phrases. If you must=20
mention Jesus, don't refer to him as the "Prince of Peace." Try the "The=20
Rocking Redeemer" or "Subcomandante J" instead."

Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, who is likely to replace Trent Lott as the=
=20
Senate's Republican leader, claims to have the votes to amend the U.S.=20
Patriot Act to punish as treason the waging of peace during Christmas.

According to Senator Frist, "Now that we're at war with Saddam, oops, I=20
mean, IF we go to war with Saddam, we can't think of peace. While peace is=
=20
a nice thought, it should be an afterthought. We should think about it=20
after we win the never-ending War on Terrorism. We can address peace after=
=20
we've killed all our enemies."

Civil rights groups criticized the Bush Administration's policy, but took=20
great pains to make it clear that they were not attacking the President.=20
One prominent civil rights advocate said, "Doing away with the First=20
Amendment does concerns us somewhat, but we don't mean any disrespect=20
toward President Bush. We can and do distinguish between the man and his=20
policies. We think George Bush is adorable and that his every command,=20
however quirky and bizarre, should be obeyed without pause. However, we do=
=20
think his policies are a little Nazi-like =96 er, you did say this was off=
=20
the record, right?"

Polls reveal that 30 percent of Americans believe that the difference=20
between peace and piece is pure semantics. Fifty-five percent believe that=
=20
the Augusta National Golf Club should invite Saddam Hussein and Osama bin=20
Ladin before allowing any women to join. And 73 percent think that buying=20
holiday greeting cards that say "Peace on Earth," especially those=20
featuring Snoopy and Woodstock, are the best way to achieve world peace.

Thanks, Omid,

I didn't like the commercials either.

And I got to meet this guy once or twice, and have been to dozens of their
shows when they were the only band that mattered.

This is really pretty disrespectful of you, which is a total shock to me
that you would do this.

I don't even want to get into details, and i don't even know what they are,
but if Struumer/Jones, the most prolific songwriting pair since
Lennon/McCartney lost the rights to their songs, as did Lennon/McCartney,
they wouldn't be the only artists that happened to.

The next time you feel the need to shoot from the hip like this, please hold
your breath and count to 24 hours after the death of a major artist.

Thank you and Merry Xmas.

Regards,

nic

Piece Of Earth

By Oscar Gonzalez, AlterNet
December 23, 2002

Washington, DC (Neuters) - Concerned that messages of love and peace may be
hampering its War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration is calling on
Americans during this holiday season to think "Piece Of Earth" instead of
"Peace On Earth."

According to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, "Peace is so
elusive, especially when you're not looking for it. So why not promote
something that you actually want - a piece of the Earth? Right now the
piece of Earth is Iraq, but it could apply nicely to any prime real estate
worth fighting for. Heck, I've got visions of Venezuela's oil fields
playing in my head even as we speak."

Mr. Rumsfeld also urged family members of US troops not to mail cards and
letters that mention peace.

"We don't want to confuse our soldiers about what their main mission is out
in the field. If you send cards, use a Sharpie to cross out love, peace,
and any other offending or unpatriotic words or phrases. If you must
mention Jesus, don't refer to him as the "Prince of Peace." Try the "The
Rocking Redeemer" or "Subcomandante J" instead."

Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, who is likely to replace Trent Lott as the
Senate's Republican leader, claims to have the votes to amend the U.S.
Patriot Act to punish as treason the waging of peace during Christmas.

According to Senator Frist, "Now that we're at war with Saddam, oops, I
mean, IF we go to war with Saddam, we can't think of peace. While peace is
a nice thought, it should be an afterthought. We should think about it
after we win the never-ending War on Terrorism. We can address peace after
we've killed all our enemies."

Civil rights groups criticized the Bush Administration's policy, but took
great pains to make it clear that they were not attacking the President.
One prominent civil rights advocate said, "Doing away with the First
Amendment does concerns us somewhat, but we don't mean any disrespect
toward President Bush. We can and do distinguish between the man and his
policies. We think George Bush is adorable and that his every command,
however quirky and bizarre, should be obeyed without pause. However, we do
think his policies are a little Nazi-like - er, you did say this was off
the record, right?"

Polls reveal that 30 percent of Americans believe that the difference
between peace and piece is pure semantics. Fifty-five percent believe that
the Augusta National Golf Club should invite Saddam Hussein and Osama bin
Ladin before allowing any women to join. And 73 percent think that buying
holiday greeting cards that say "Peace on Earth," especially those
featuring Snoopy and Woodstock, are the best way to achieve world peace.

Subject: [sfraves] 21 and under... again...

OK,

I know this question comes up like every week or two, but I honestly
never thought I would need to know so I have TOTALLY ignored the answer
;)

Q: Where can I take a visiting 20 year old to have a good time in the
bay area?  In the last 12 hours I have realized that virtually NONE of
the places I hang out at are all ages...  Just about anywhere is cool,
but I live in the East bay so that would be best, and I'd prefer to be
in the jungle if you know what I mean...  But just about all music here
is good so, I'll take what I can get ;)

Thanks so much for any help!!!

Jodiah

High-tech billboards tune in to drivers' tastes
Roadside signs coming to Bay Area listen to car
radios, then adjust pitch

Robert Salladay, Chronicle Staff Writer   Sunday,
December 22, 2002

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The billboard is listening.

In an advertising ploy right out of Steven Spielberg's
"Minority Report," electronic billboards in the Bay
Area and Sacramento are being equipped to profile
commuters as they whiz by -- and then instantly
personalize freeway ads based on the wealth and habits
of those drivers.

For example, if the freeway were packed with country
music listeners, the billboards might make a pitch for
casinos. If National Public Radio were on, the
billboards could change to ads for a high-quality car
or a gourmet grocery.

The billboards -- in Palo Alto, Daly City and Fremont
-- will pick up which radio stations are being played
and then instantly access a vast databank of
information about the people who typically listen to
those stations. The electronic ads will then change to
fit listener profiles.

In the buzzy hum of 21st century commercialism, it's
the latest way for businesses to target consumers
without wasting money on scattershot appeals. Many
auto dealerships already use a similar system to
identify the stations people are listening to as they
pull into a car lot -- and then place ads on those
stations.

"You know what this is about? Accountability," said
Tom Langeland, president of the Sacramento firm Alaris
Media Network, which owns the 10 video screen
billboards in California. "People are struggling, the
world is becoming a more competitive place, and
advertising dollars have been a huge, misplaced
factor. Advertisers don't know where their money is
going."

Langeland said the technology should be in place
within a few weeks on electronic billboards off
Interstate 280 at Serramonte Shopping Center and off
Interstate 880 at Southland Mall near Fremont. Another
sign on Highway 101 in Palo Alto also is being
outfitted. Billboards in Sacramento, nearby Roseville
(Placer County) and Los Angeles also will use the
technology.

In Spielberg's "Minority Report," Tom Cruise's
character makes his way through city streets as
billboard advertisements scan his retina and then
personalize ads for products.


BIG BROTHER WORLD
Several of the Bay Area residents contacted by The
Chronicle said they were mostly resigned to a Big
Brother world where government and corporations
collect large amounts of information on citizens,
often without permission.

Many worried about the distraction of the large,
video-screen billboards. Vernon Burton of San Leandro
called it "junk capitalism" motivated by shameless
greed. Lowell Young of Mariposa said, "Everyone should
turn off their radios until they let us have our
privacy back."

"What's next?" asked Rob Blackwelder of Oakland. " . .
. It would be as if someone knocked on your front door
and said, 'I couldn't help notice through your window
that you're watching Fox News. . . . Could I interest
you in a subscription to (the conservative magazine)
National Review?' "

The California system uses a "consumer monitoring
system" developed by Mobiltrak of Chandler, Ariz., to
pick up radio waves "leaked" from the antennas of up
to 90 percent of all cars passing by and pinpoint the
stations being played.

Each station has a typical listener profile derived
from detailed consumer surveys. The system will assess
the most popular radio station during a given hour and
target the ads to those drivers.

"I can tell you how much money they spent on fast food
in the last week. I can tell you where they are
shopping," said Phyllis Neill, chief operating officer
of Mobiltrak. "I can tell you what percentage of them
were married and shop at Petsmart and made more than
$100,000 a year and potentially could come to Office
Max in the next six months."


DATA COLLECTED AND PASSED ON
Neill envisions a system of Mobiltrak-equipped
billboards along, say, a six- mile stretch of freeway.
The first billboard's receiver would collect data on a
block of cars and send it to the billboards farther
on, which would then switch to the appropriate ads.

"We have only just begun to scratch the surface of
what the technology can do," Neill said.

Privacy experts are not particularly worried about the
new billboards, as long as society continues to allow
people to remain anonymous. But they do notice a shift
in focus: Where the big concern used to be Internet
privacy, now it's physical space, from closed-circuit
monitoring to red-light cameras.

"I don't think it's really so much about stopping
technology or pulling the shades a little tighter,"
said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the
nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington, D.C. "It's about making sure there are
safeguards on the personal information that businesses
collect."

Neill said the technology doesn't have the ability to
listen to people's conversations or CD players, nor
would advertisers even care about such things.

The technology is designed to be anonymous and
passive, she said, and relies on information about
large numbers of drivers.

Hollywood already is installing similar technology in
movie theater ads -- electronic "posters" that
interact with customers to show moving digital images.
Walk by an electronic poster of Jennifer Lopez, and
she might wink at you.

"Minority Report" producer Bonnie Curtis, in a recent
New York Times article about the new medium, said she
could envision interactive posters that talk to
moviegoers, perhaps in Spielberg's voice.

"When I hear him say, 'Hey, Bonnie, I like that
blouse. Why haven't you come to see my movie yet?' "
Curtis told the Times, "then I'd say we are getting
very close."

If anyone wants to listen to some old jungle 94-97 I put up a mix I did

http://www.killasubz.com/2002/html/djsiphon_ninetofive.m3u

It should stream.  If it doesn't then copy and paste the above url into 
your favorite mp3 player.

The mix above and 4 others are on http://www.urbanassault.org (mixes 
from Hak, Das and Siphon).  The site is getting an annual face lift but

Er, I dunno ... consider the following, from Salon a few days back:
(http://archive.salon.com/ent/feature/2002/12/17/tolkien_brin/)

"... Now ponder something that comes through even the party-line
demonization of a crushed enemy -- this clear-cut and undeniable fact:
Sauron's army was the one that included every species and race on Middle
Earth, including all the despised colors of humanity, and all the lower
classes.

Hmm. Did they all leave their homes and march to war thinking, "Oh, goody,
let's go serve an evil Dark Lord"?

Or might they instead have thought they were the "good guys," with a
justifiable grievance worth fighting for, rebelling against an ancient,
rigid, pyramid-shaped, feudal hierarchy topped by invader-alien elfs and
their Numenorean-colonialist human lackeys?

Picture, for a moment, Sauron the Eternal Rebel, relentlessly maligned by
the victors of the War of the Ring -- the royalists who control the bards
and scribes (and moviemakers). Sauron, champion of the common Middle
Earthling! Vanquished but still revered by the innumerable poor and
oppressed who sit in their squalid huts, wary of the royal secret police
with their magical spy-eyes, yet continuing to whisper stories, secretly
dreaming and hoping that someday he will return ... bringing more rings."

Er, I dunno ... consider the following, from Salon a few days back:
(http://archive.salon.com/ent/feature/2002/12/17/tolkien_brin/)

"... Now ponder something that comes through even the party-line
demonization of a crushed enemy -- this clear-cut and undeniable fact:
Sauron's army was the one that included every species and race on Middle
Earth, including all the despised colors of humanity, and all the lower
classes.

Hmm. Did they all leave their homes and march to war thinking, "Oh, goody,
let's go serve an evil Dark Lord"?

Or might they instead have thought they were the "good guys," with a
justifiable grievance worth fighting for, rebelling against an ancient,
rigid, pyramid-shaped, feudal hierarchy topped by invader-alien elfs and
their Numenorean-colonialist human lackeys?

Picture, for a moment, Sauron the Eternal Rebel, relentlessly maligned by
the victors of the War of the Ring -- the royalists who control the bards
and scribes (and moviemakers). Sauron, champion of the common Middle
Earthling! Vanquished but still revered by the innumerable poor and
oppressed who sit in their squalid huts, wary of the royal secret police
with their magical spy-eyes, yet continuing to whisper stories, secretly
dreaming and hoping that someday he will return ... bringing more rings."

I'm REALLY starting to think that I should be a Canadian...

I mean, with all the jokes made about Canada, and its citizens, they
seem to have a much better grip on some facets of reality then the
current US leadership.

Or - maybe I just haven't heard the bad stuff yet ;)

and dwarves and dark-skinned or proletarian men who fought for the Ringlord 
were fooled by Sauron's propaganda.
Fair enough. Even that slight variation adds flavor to an already-great 
tale, making you pity Sauron's dupes a little, even though you still cheer 
as they're slaughtered down to the last private and orcoral.
Come on, folks, a little empathy!
Instead of railing against "evil," try to understand it. That's always been 
the best way to defeat it."--- also from Salon.

I've always had some sympathy for the devil:)  God's most beautiful angel....

Literary exegesis, like the biblical variety, seems to be to be expressive 
of the views of the interpreter and all that's fine and dandy.  In the 
film, at least, evil is clear cut.  The book has always been much more 
challenging.  But all art reflects the times and yearnings of the artist 
and his/her culture.

I certainly don't have the unqualified faith in the future of technology 
that the Salon writer seems to have, and in my soul I believe in magik.  Is 
magik the manifestation of undemocratic powers?  Perhaps.  Or maybe it is 
available to all of us if we open our minds and hearts to it.

I prefer walking and talking trees to smelly factories:)  I also believe in 
the humane uses of technology, which probably places me at variance with 
Tolkein, but JRR was the product, really of the Romantic age.

Me...I prefer the dialectic.  Take the past and the present and find some 
compromise.

Love,

Apollo

Actually i was watching the history channel last night, and they had this
show about trying to figure out when jesus was actually born, and they've
narrowed it down to be sometime in the spring and about 3 to 5bc so we're
all actually a few years off.  maybe that would explain all this crazy
bullshit goin on around the world.  2000 wasn't really the 2nd millenium,
we're all a few years off, so maybe 2004 is the actual 2nd millenium.  maybe
that explains the whole leap year effect too....whoa....man...ever look at
the back of a 20$ bill????  ON WEEEEEEDDDDDD!!!!  hehehehehe

Subject: Re: [sfraves] my thong....srr, but putting nrr to get rid of the monkey

hopefully, it is completely comfortable....you aren't
supposed to feel it in the way that people think you
might....i have been wearing them for many, many years
now, because i don't like pantylines and bulges on
me...anyone else can wear whatever they want, but if
you never try out a good thong, you are missing out
for sure....a good thong has nice, even smooth
stitching on the back part...there shouldn't be any
exposed elastic, and if the thong fits on your hips or
just below without binding (meaning not too too
tight..the tinier the better in my world...some of
them make me think people are making undies for some
strange large animals and not ladies)....anyway, you
should be able to forget that you even have it on...if
you can feel it, don't give up....go get a better
one...also, i hope that you and everyone else will
have a nice christmas day and night...it is very cold
pretty much everywhere for the people who are reading
this...maybe someone is in the caribbean (sp?)...i got
a brazilian bikini for such good occasions....:) :)
:)...if you finished your christmas shopping, it is
time to shop for yourself...hmmmmm, maybe all of the
stores are all closed...i shop for me while i shop for
others...all done with christmas this year, but not
with shopping...i like clothes and i need warmer,
cuter things...a girl can never be too cute. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Holiday Wishes

Thanks Terry,

And a Happy Festivus to you and yours.

Mine was good, I won the 'Feats of Strength' and our unadorned aluminum pole
is plain this year.

 I was invited to Sen. Lott's annual Kwanzaa Celebration but too many people
were going to show up this year, and I preferred it when it was smaller and
more intimate.

Plus the fact that it snowed last night and today and that put a damper on
it, as you can well imagine.

Here's George Orwell's take on the Holyday, might go well with the URLs you
posted:

    I just got home from taking my Mother to church for Christmas Eve =
services, and I had a lot of strong feelings. I was raised Episcopalian =
(Catholic-Lite for those who don't know what that is.) My Mother took me =
to church every Sunday, the same church from the time I was 3 until I =
left for college at age 18. I loved it! Through going to different =
schools and being around different people, church was the most constant =
thing in my life. If I were to go there some Sunday, I'm sure there'd =
still be some old women there who would talk about what a devil I was =
when I was little. As I became a teenager, I began to understand the =
meaning of the prayers I was reciting, and could feel the presence of =
God when we worshiped. Growing up in East Oakland (near Eastmont Mall) =
everyone around me was Christian, be they Black and most likely Baptist, =
or Latino and most likely Catholic, so I never questioned my faith.
    When I was 18 I left for college in Santa Barbara, and from that =
moment on, I have primarily been surrounded by Atheists, Agnostics, =
Jews, Muslims, and most recently, people who are spiritual in many other =
ways . After my Dad died 3 years ago, I started picking my Mom up every =
Sunday and taking her to church. She loved it, but I found that no =
matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get into it. I could never recapture =
that feeling. The only part of it that I liked was having the chance to =
slow down for a little while, kneel in silence, think about what was =
going in my life and to give thanks to God for all that I have in my =
life, no matter how bad things might seem as I burn the candles at both =
ends. My Mom and I started church shopping, but I could never find =
anyplace that I could get into. I know that part of it is that everyone =
else there was either a child, a parent, or an elder.
    All the things about Christianity that have been bugging me for =
years, such as the racial and gender biases that dominate societies such =
as our own, and the fact that the bible has been translated repeatedly =
as it has passed from the hands of one ruler to the next have caused me =
to have a lot of doubts about Christ. Plus the fact that since the =
disciples all thought that Jesus was coming back in their lifetimes, =
nothing was written down on paper by anyone for like 100 years (don't =
remember the exact timeframe.) We all know how stories can change and =
grow when it's all he said/she said. Did Jesus really walk on water, or =
was he just standing in really shallow water and the story grew with his =
fame? Recently I have decided that I while I still believe in God or =
Goddess or something, I don't believe that Jesus was the son of God, any =
more than the rest of us are. I've avoided taking my Mom to church for =
the last couple of months, but I knew that she would really love to go =
tonight so I called her today and told her I would come pick her up.
    Tonight's service is the Lessons and Carols service, in which 9 =
hymns are sung in between 9 reading from the bible. The nine readings =
are supposed to tell the story leading up to the birth of Jesus, =
starting in Genesis, going into the prophecies and culminating with the =
birth story. When I was a kid at the Episcopal church, this service =
started at 10pm and went until midnight. I was actually a little =
excited, because I figured that here was my chance to hear the evidence =
of Jesus' divinity presented to me in black in white, which should help =
clear up any confusion. At the Methodist church where we went tonight, =
the service started at 7pm and ended at 7:45pm. They trimmed back a lot =
of verses from the readings and songs. But even what little I did hear =
did nothing to change my mind. I felt like a hypocrite for sitting there =
singing songs of praise about Jesus. When Mary asks the Angel how she =
could possibly have a baby when she wasn't married, it reminded me of =
the ways that marriage has been used to control both men and women over =
the years. When the 3 kings followed a star to the manger...we all know =
that's impossible, since the stars are not just a few hundred feet up =
like we used to think they were.
    So, I could honestly pray to God, but whenever Jesus or Christ was =
mentioned, I said the words but felt like a total hypocrite. The people =
around us were very nice and pleasant folks, and I felt like I was =
mocking their beliefs by saying one thing but not believing it in my =
heart. So, I have to figure out what to do, since I can't in good =
conscience keep avoiding taking my Mom to church. I haven't talked to =
her yet about my struggle, although I have talked to several friends =
about it. Just the other night I saw the episode of the Simpsons where =
Lisa rejects Christianity and discovers that she's a Buddhist. That =
episode makes a lot of sense to me. I know that I am a spiritual person =
but I'm still trying to figure out what form that spirituality will =
take.
    The other emotional thing tonight was about my Dad. My Dad died =
about 3 1/2 years ago, but he had a stroke 11 years ago, was knocked =
completely flat, and had to relearn how to think and talk, but never =
relearned how to walk. He stopped being the person that he was and =
became a completely new person. One of the things I miss most about my =
Dad from when I was a kid, was that he had a beautiful singing voice. It =
was really deep, and at Christmas time he would walk around the house =
singing Christmas songs. I really miss that. Even as I type this, my =
eyes are clouding up, and I haven't heard him sing in many years. I =
almost cried in church tonight when they sang The First Noel. I have no =
real feelings anymore on his birthday, Father's day, or the day that he =
died, but every year at Christmas, I miss his singing. I wonder if it's =
going to be like this for the rest of my life.

Happy  :-)

PS:    I don't want you to think that I'm all depressed, lonely and =
suicidal! Tomorrow I grub down with my Mom and nephews at my =
sister-in-law's house out in scenic Newman. That's the part I love about =
holidays, getting to be with the people you love and who love you no =
matter what!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: he knows what radio you are tuned to (fwd)

        The California system uses a "consumer monitoring
        system" developed by Mobiltrak of Chandler, Ariz., to
        pick up radio waves "leaked" from the antennas of up
        to 90 percent of all cars passing by and pinpoint the
        stations being played.
        
That means it is sensitive enough to pick up a signal of a few
microwatts.  Suppose someone were to key up their mobile ham
transmitter as they drove by those things.  Those put out between
50 and 1500 watts, which is up to 100,000,000 times more power.
I think that would desensitize their receiver for a while.
There is an amateur radio frequency allocation very close to one
of the intermediate frequencies they are trying to detect.

The FCC rules against causing deliberate interference only apply
if you are causing interference to intentional transmissions,
which the IF signal from a radio receiver is not.  

        ...
        Each station has a typical listener profile derived
        from detailed consumer surveys. The system will assess
        the most popular radio station during a given hour and
        target the ads to those drivers.

So everybody tune to KPFA when they go by the billboards,
and see what that makes them do.

...
        Neill said the technology doesn't have the ability to
        listen to people's conversations or CD players, nor
        would advertisers even care about such things.
        
OH YES THEY WOULD.  They just don't know how to do it.


Happy Holidays

tree...don't use too many glass ones either, i don't
want the kittie to get hurt." and then this morning, i
was half awake drinking my coffee when i glanced at
the tree and after focusing, i saw that the whole tree
was covered with sharp metal hooks and only glass
ornaments hanging everywhere...also, my little bear
that i only see once a year, because it is supposed to
be a christmas tree ornament...it looks just like one
that my grandma had, i think she probably gave it to
me...anyway, the little bear is also NOT on the tree. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Chicago haps?

Anyone got an inside line on anything good happening in Chicago between
now and Sunday? I'm back in the motherland for a few days and could use
a little something: breaks, jungle, psytrance, anything but diva house...

Subject: [sfraves] Anti-Drug Rebuttal Spots, What i'm working on now....

Content-Type: text/plain;
	charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

There are a series of ads out, paid for by our Government that state =
unequivacably that drugs fund terrorism.

Below are two drafts of rebuttal ads to that that I've written that i =
want to produce, and soon and am looking for help to make this a =
reality.

I'm clear that this isn't about anything but $$$$$$$$$$$ and power and =
control.

Street price of cannabis is $5,000.00 a pound through the legal clinics =
in California.

It will drop to near zero if it were legal.

If everyone can grow KGB, who would ever buy it, or even have too?

Its 'illicitness' is what has driven up the price, nobody is addressing =
that aspect of it yet.

The 'mark-up' on heroin is 5,000 percent because it is illegal.

The amount of heroin needed to provide for every sick junky on earth for =
a year can fit on the lot I am writing this from.=20

it's *only* 400 metric tons a year, AND given the computers we have it =
is child's play to make sure it gets distributed sanely.

That won't happen because the 'mark-up' is 5,000 percent and it creates =
a lot of employment via police, lawyers, re-habs, jails, etc....

It's bullshit.

Here's the draft of the first rebuttal to the 'Drugs fund Terrorism' =
commercials, it's a lil rough, but here's the gist:

(V.O. child's voice):

This is the Poppy.

This is the Poppy that is cheap to grow, process and distribute.

This is the Person.

This is the Person that uses and buys the Poppy.

This is the Person who is in jail because they stole the Money to use =
the Poppy.

Why did they steal the Money for the Poppy if it is cheap to grow, =
process and distribute?

This is the Congress that doesn't like the Person that uses the Poppy =
that is cheap to grow, process and distribute.

This is the Congress that wrote the Bill to outlaw the Poppy and its use =
by the Person who is in jail because they stole the Money to buy the =
Poppy that is cheap to grow and distribute.

This is the President that signed the Bill that became The Law.

This is the Law that drove the price of the Poppy up by 5,000 percent

This is the Cartel.

This is the Cartel, that was created by the Law, that was willing to =
take the risk for the=20
Money that comes from the difference in the price between the legal and =
illegal Poppy and sell it to the Person that will buy the Poppy, no =
matter the cost.

This is the Cartel that doesn't care if the Person goes to jail because =
they use the Poppy.

This is the Cartel that doesn't have to follow any rules and can sell =
whatever they want, to the Person that uses the Poppy, and if it's not =
tested and too strong and kills you, they don't care, they've already =
got the money from the Person.

This is the Cartel that will buy the Congress to sell their 'War' =
because it keeps them in business.

This is the Cartel that will kill you and anyone else who gets in the =
way of the Money, which they get from the Person, who they don't care =
about, as long as they get the Money.

Any Questions?

Heroin is a lil too emotionally loaded for most people to handle, and =
the above is a lil too provocative, so my focus is prolly going to be =
more along the lines of working with the cannabis issue, to wit, here's =
another one I just came up with, and keep in mind, it's a lil rough and =
it's right off the top of my head, so please bear with.

(V.O.  child's voice):

This is the Plant.

This is the Plant that grows freely in the ground, anywhere on Earth.

This is the Plant that is the Medicine that helps the person who is =
dying.

This is the Plant that costs the sick person who is dying $5,000.00 a =
pound.

Why does the plant cost so much if it grows freely in the ground, =
anywhere on Earth?

This is the man that sold the Paper to the Government that needed the =
Paper to fight the war to stop The Hitler.

This is the plant that can also make the Paper the Government needs to =
fight the War to stop the Hitler for much cheaper than the Man can sell =
his Paper to the Government.

This man didn't like that Plant because if the Plant was around, he =
couldn't sell his Paper for the money, so he made a movie that said the =
plant was Bad and made the People who used the Plant Mad.

This is the Man who spent the Money to make the movie that said the =
Plant is bad and this is the Congress that made the Law, so no one could =
use the Plant and the Man could sell his Paper to the Government for the =
Money, that he used to build his Castle.

These are the People that did not listen to the Man who made the Movie.

These are the People that said is OK for the sick people who are dying, =
who need The Plant as Medicine to feel better to have it.

This is the Government who still listens to the Man who made the Movie =
that has The Castle that the Paper paid for that.

This is the Government with the Gun.

This is the Government with the Gun that they shoved in the face of the =
Quadrapalegic that helps grow the Plant that the sick people who are =
dying need.

This is the Government with the Gun that they used to tell the =
Quadrapalegic to GET UP We are going to arrest you for growing the =
Plant.

Any Questions?



Admittedly it's a lil rough and really needs to be broken into a couple =
of different spots covering different aspects of it because it covers =
too much ground at once, and the message gets a little muddied.

Like I said this is only the first draft.

The point is to make them as simple as possible and get them distributed =
as widely as possible, since no other view is getting out through =
conventional outlets.

I need help in creating these, some Flash wizzes would be a great help.

It strikes me that a rave list such as this might be a place to start, =
so if you have any interest, contact me back here, and feel free to =
forward these drafts to anyone who may have in interest in helping out.

Thanks,

nic

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Anti-Drug Rebuttal Spots, What i'm working on
	now....

Not a bad idea.. Maybe if something like this (edited to cater to the
nation's short-attention-span audience) were to go into effect after the
first wave backlash, then more people would be accepting of the message.

What started out as what seemed like kind of a joke by Arianna Huffington in
one of her columns is apparently going to become a real spoof of the
"anti-drug" ad campaign, saying how by driving an SUV (hence, using a load
of gas) you support terrorists.  No matter where you stand on that issue,
its high profile (from what I gather so far) should do enough to knock down
the drug war's credibility so that more informative campaigns like the one
you're proposing can have a direct impact...

For more on this campaign, check out:

  http://archive.salon.com/news/col/huff/2002/10/29/suv_ad/

Who knows? Maybe you can find support in that circle, as well.

Subject: [sfraves] Good Vinyl Storage / DJ Furniture?


I'm looking for something that can store lots of records that I can put my
decks on.

The closest thing I've found is:
http://www.deconomix.co.uk/products.html

A close second is:
http://www.dualsf.com/kramer_900/

Problem with the first link is it's in the UK (but the top product on that
page is almost exactly what I'm looking for), problem with the second is
that it's sorta tall with the casters and all.  Both seem a bit pricey
when all I'm looking for is a way to store a shitload of vinyl while
giving me a place to put my decks.

Cheap, simple... any ideas?

andyw

p.s.  not what I'm looking for, but is this
not totally effin' cool? -> http://www.dualsf.com/zen_450/

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Anti-Drug Rebuttal Spots, What i'm working on now....

Hey Omid,

Thanks for the leads, i will follw through.

Believe it or not, I had you in mind for a collaborator on this, because i
wrote both of these last night after I saw both your Flash Xmas cards and I
enjoyed them both immensely.

Like i said, these are rough drafts, i'd like to tighten both of them up to
get them down to  :30 and :60 second spots, for one, and for two, i'd like
to do a series of them.

There's a lot of material to work with, and they do write themselves.

Don't need an answer right away, if you will think of it while I work on the
edit process, that will be cool enough for now.

I don't see buying any TV time, the web i believe is enough to get this
message out with, and a higher percentage of web people actually vote, so
there is that.


A secondary project I am working on for a buddy who came up with the idea is
getting one person per arrested marijuania user who is currently in a jail
or prison to show up to represent that prisoner who is in jail on a
marijuania charge on:

 4/20, 2003 for a few silent minutes at 4:20 in the afternoon.

in either Washington DC, or their local City Hall/Jail for a few silent
minutes at 4:20 in the afternoon.

Silently, show up for a few minutes, don't bring anything, save for 2 forms
of ID, no protests, no speeches, because, well, there's nothing left to say.

Make a nice visual on the Evening News.

Turns out it's a Sunday, and I can't think of better way to spend my time
that day.

If you like the idea, feel free to tell as many people as you like about it,
there are roughly 750,000 arrests a year for marijuania, so that's no small
amount of people to get the word out to, and the lead time is only 4 months.

Be nice if Slashdot picked it up around, say early April.

Not a bad idea.. Maybe if something like this (edited to cater to the
nation's short-attention-span audience) were to go into effect after the
first wave backlash, then more people would be accepting of the message.

What started out as what seemed like kind of a joke by Arianna Huffington in
one of her columns is apparently going to become a real spoof of the
"anti-drug" ad campaign, saying how by driving an SUV (hence, using a load
of gas) you support terrorists.  No matter where you stand on that issue,
its high profile (from what I gather so far) should do enough to knock down
the drug war's credibility so that more informative campaigns like the one
you're proposing can have a direct impact...

For more on this campaign, check out:

  http://archive.salon.com/news/col/huff/2002/10/22/oil/index.html

  http://archive.salon.com/news/col/huff/2002/10/29/suv_ad/

Who knows? Maybe you can find support in that circle, as well.

the cheapest solution i've found is to get an 18" x 48" Metro wire shelf
set, with 3 shelf racks. that's just enough room on the top for 2 decks and
a medium-width mixer (i have an old numark 1260x, and it's *just* right),
plus it'll give you 8 feet of shelf space for records.

http://www.industrialhouse.com/Storage/Metro/SplitSleeves.html has a photo
of the shelf assembly. you've probably seen them before.

while most of the shelf racks have the wires running across the width
(almost useless for storing records, cuz they just fall through the holes in
the shelf), the 48" shelves have the wires running lengthwise.

you can usually find these shelves at restaurant supply stores, or better
yet, at liquidators that specialize in restaurant furniture. they're not the
prettiest solution, but they're cheap and extremely sturdy.

Orchard supply might also carry them in that size, but i think they only
sell complete sets... not sure how many shelves come with it.

good luck!

philip

ps> for the price of some of that furniture you showed, you could get
yourself a table saw and make your own. just a thought. :-)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


this comes up a lot, so why not share here too.....there are people who train wild animals..wild cats to be specific, using only hand and voice commands. someone smacked their two year old child right in front of me today, and when i said, "hey, is everything okay over here?" i recieved an immediate and very defensive reply over the truly unruley and highly illegal behavior (hit a stranger on the street and that's felony assault...hit your kid? what's that? child abuse).....anyway, sometimes, you have to assist people, meaning educate them, because sometimes, people who are adults with years of experience make huge mistakes like hitting their two year old son, and then they might proceed to tell another adult that this is how to handle a situation. it's not. if someone can train a wild cat using no whips and only hand and voice commands, i think your average person on the street can talk to their kid. peace out...:)

Subject: [sfraves] Happy Kwanzaa was: Re: [sfraves] Holiday Wishes




<<<<you know, i didn't see much fallout onto this list about the whole trent
lott fub, >>>>

i noticed that 2 and i chalk that to either, overall burnout, or peeps are
gearing up, but don't wnt 2 b bothered for right now, which is cool.

<<<<but i must say, after losing his majority leadership role in
congress: he must really hate colored folk /now/.>>>>

you think?

heheh, well, now the feeling is mutual, the diff being that they don't hate
him for the color of his skin, but the content of his character.

ouch, that smarts.

I went to my first local massive in DC last saturday, and my new g/f is a
CSpan/npr freak, which is cool to a point, cuz I want my MTV as well...

diff is, i can do both, she won't.

I was making lunch and doing other things and the local npr was on in the
background and they were running Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrat acceptance
speech from 1948.

Don't let the 'old man' cleaned up present day media demeanor he presents
fool you.

Demagogue is what he is, and was.

Pure vitriol.

After the party we were walking around the Mall just bef ore dawn and it
turns out she was listening to it upstairs too.

We both noticed the same thing, the man's cadences were almost the same as
Hitler's.

Ooops.

The thing is, i had that shit stuck in my head all afternoon and meditated
on it.

When we arrived at the party I saw and felt something diff.

Pat buchanan looked at the coming demographic of the USA and doesn't like
what he sees, wrote a book about it in this past year.

he sees that the reign of the dead, white european male is coming, and soon,
and he sees it as a bad thing.

i don't.

we've done enough good, and for that matter, enough damage, and it's time
for us to leave the stage.

this whole event is the death rattle for this generation, sort of akin to
Windows Millenium being the end of DOS.

Kind of crashy, wasn't it?

Same thing.

We ravers are the future, they might try and fight us, but our day is coming
and the likes of Trent Lott and his ilk?

Their day is past, they just haven't come to terms with that yet, but the
truth is, they're history.

They will try to hold on, and it will be ugly, but in the end....

It's us.

let's try not to make a botch of things.

<<i will join you in celebrating the simplicity of my festivus pole. :)
>>>>>>>>>.

that was yesterday.

today through the first *really* IS Kwanzaa, and it has a special meaning
for me this year.

Hi there everyone. 

we are in the studio and have made our 5th house track. we need some lyrics. If you would like your lyrics to be on a record that has worldwide release, write back. Our first 4 tracks have been released on a major independant label. We are a spanish collective, living in Mallorca. This is a true offer, the lyrics will be spoken by me over the beat, as a kind of intro, however I am keen to hear all input. ( even the funny shit that will obviously come my way...) Creative hats on everybody, and lets hear some deep lyrics...we use the emagic studio with mac plus two hard racks. I have phaser plug ins so I can change my voice to suit the lyric, however if its a really shit hot song you send, I would consider using a session singer. All lyricists will be credited for their work and appear on the songs credits.

Try home depot - they have a bunch of modular furniture systems for sale,
where you can mix n match multiple shelf and support sizes. The ones I've
seen are not overly pretty, but quite easy to construct and customize.

You can also check out Southern Lumber Company, if you're in the mood to
build somehing from scratch (the British shelf looked simple).

Subject: [sfraves] Moda/D:FUSE at Release this Saturday night...(bsp)

I know that it's been some time since I've contributed anything to the list.
I hope that everyone had a wonderful Christmas. I spent most of it cleaning
rather than celebrating as a large family will do that to you.

Anyways, just wanted to invite any of you to Release at 1015 this Saturday
night as I will be sharing the decks with D:FUSE, 11 - 6 am, in the main
room.

Anyone that can give me a shout before noon Friday, I'll be happy to include
you on my guest list. I have a couple of openings left on it.
Best regards!

you know, sasha shulgin presents his "Onesies-Twosies" theory in the
PIHKAL... basically, his idea is that E.T. intelligences created human DNA
and set it loose in the Universe, and that we are a product of that.

and everyone trusts Uncle Sasha, no? ;-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] reno... anyone?

I'm in the same boat as well. I'll be staying in Northstar the next few days
and then heading to Reno or Southshore. I'm not wild about going to Reno
because I find the place trashy. My friends think it will be cool, but I
think it will be full of trashy drunk people looking like something off a
girls gone wild video. As Steph would say... EW. If anyone out there knows
of something *good* that's not necessarily rave related happening in Tahoe
let me know. Something a bit classier or low key would rock. A bottle of
champagne while sitting in a hot tub surrounded by snow sounds good!

Oh and if anyone else here is going to be in Northstar or the area this
weekend email // call // sms me.

Heh...

I guess I must be about the most politically jaded person in the country.  To
me, this was just "more of the same" and I wasn't really paying attention.

After all, what does it REALLY matter who they choose as their leader?  The
real tragedy is that racist bigots like Lott, Thurmond, and their ilk were
allowed to hold public office in the first place.

Hey guys,
   As some of you know, I'm down in the San Luis Obispo area for
Christmas/New Years. Is anything going on UG for NYE? Or is there any
decent event going on at all? I'd like to get out and party to some good
music, but this area seems dead...

Thursday, January 2, 2003 ** Weekly: Kit Kat **

(Every Thursday Night) - Kit Kat introduced the
weekly party concept to San Francisco in March 1989
and against all odds established itself as the only
Thursday night party worthy of a monster sweat.
Today Kit Kat sits on a Richter proof funk
foundation which is shaken to the core by local
fanatics determined to dance their ass off. This
party has inexplicably managed to elude the weekend
warrior virus and has a balls to the wall energy
behind it. By default The End Up provides a
comfortable who cares what you are wearing
atmosphere, so all attitude inevitably gets checked
at the door. The party gets started right away and
peaks when the local after hour posse swings on to
the dance floor and pushes the elevator above cloud
line in the nick of closing time.

The knobs are manhandled by resident DJ Marc
Jellybear whom in turn passes the closing baton to
rotating guests Simon, Garth, Miguel Migs, Jonene,
Wyatt Earp & John Howard. In addition the club
hosts monthly special events with the next level of
over hyped DJs that have been, however, thoroughly
Kit Kat tested and do in the end justify having to
pass the hat around for business class airfare.

Overall a guaranteed must call in sick in the next
few hours experience. To join the guest list &
receive passes via e-mail: kitkatVIP@sbcglobal.net

Hah hah hah.... yeah...  You are out of luck in SLO most likely for 
NYE...  Check CCRaves and jump on the email list there (www.ccraves.org); 
don't expect any massive response (maybe house party?)... Good luck finding 
something in the central coast area though... You probably will have to 
travel; Santa Barbara, etc.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [krr] david lynch


Where does he get those amazing women?

David Lynch is an Eagle Scout, btw.

Not that that explains anything, or mebbe it does.

Dennis Hopper was 3 years sober when he played 'Frank, The Well Dressed Man'
in 'Blue Velvet.'

The scene @ 'One Eyed Jack's,' despite it bordering on being PG, is easily
one of the hottest I've ever seen on film so i can c y u might be a Lynch
convert.

As far as breaks go for tonight, i got nuthin 4 ya, since I'm in dc now.

i just watched 'fire walk with me'. i was never a big david lynch fan, but i
think i am now. i should catch up on some of his work. i think also
understanding alot of it involves being really really really stoned.

also, td is trying to pressure me into going to 1015 tonight, but i want to
hear breaks, please sugest something, anyone.

Email Eriko Hase at Futique Management <eriko@futic.com> in Tokyo. She'll
definitely steer you in the right direction. I'd leave the bit about the
drunk and sleazy women out, though.

If you want to hit up a good club, Yellow is definitely where it's at! It's
in the Minato-ku District in Tokyo. The place is always packed and the music
is good. Tonight they have Satoshi Tomiie with Ko Kimura, Bedrock meets SAW.

Or you can step over that fine line of getting into other peoples 
business.  Frankly, if the child needs a little more than a voice 
gesture then  some forms of physicality may be suited.  Then again with 
this country -  that alone can step over the line of abuse.

Unless the person was literally going beyond disciplining their child I 
feel you had no right to interfere.  IMHO

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Bring on the clones, meet your maker?

i saved this to read till today, and the front page of
cnn is different...maybe i will be able to find the
article again later. i think it would be nice to make
a twin of me....i know at least one person who would
find the pleasure of two of me to be almost lethal.
:)...for me, it would be fun to have a clone who
didn't mind doing some things for me while i am
keeping warm in my bed....i am usually cold
lately.....also, in the second article, the founder of
the religion is from clarmont-ferand...(sp?)....i have
only heard of that place one other time. i actually
met someone from there, and i don't think he believes
in extraterestrial (sp? you don't have to correct my
errors..i am just kind of reminding myself to focus on
these words and will  learn to spell them at some
point...) anyway, i think they also make tires
there..i know they are close to a big tire place, but
also, they have their specialties too, unless i am
mistaken. french people are fascinating. i met a
family who trains tigers, big snakes, like boas, and
birds. the family is from france...i don't know why
they do that. they are just a regular family, and do
not participate in circus's or amusement parks..maybe
they do stuff for zoo's...i don't know. i heard there
was a bird that got out of the s.f. zoo
recently....she flew all the way to a mountain top in
san bruno...there is nothing in san bruno but a jail
and some very sick buffulo's....i probably spelled
that wrong too. there are a lot of parties coming up
for new year's eve. i have a ton of invites, but also,
i am so cold...i am so cold, that i might not be able
to wear my new year's dress and heels, and i don't
know which one's those are, but there are other looks
to do...i just get so sick of having to be hard core
when i play. :) okay, i will stop writing for the
moment. :)

Satoshi Tomiie was just here in New York City a few weeks ago.  He played a killer set!  I even got him to sign some of my wax!I haven't been in Tokyo in a few years, but check out Roppongi.  It's the district in Tokyo where all the non-Japanese "gaijin" party with all the Japanese people.  I always found good bars and clubs over there.  I remember spending at least one NYE in Roppongi and it was craaaaazy!!!!!  Lots of good underground music back then...  But don't discount the other areas either...--- Chris  wrote:> Satoshi Tomiie?

 In email, as in snailmail and those photocopied advertisments
posted on laundromat bulletin boards, do not pay money to get leads
on making money. The usual result is you will get information that
you could have found out all by yourself. Or else you'll get a list
of real but crappy jobs.

 As far as conducting surveys from home for $$:

 Go to http://directory.google.com/

 Search for the words [ "work at home" surveys ]

 Disclaimer - I've never tried any "work at home" offers, so I don't
have any information about any of the businesses in the search results.

 Good luck Osby!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] two year olds don't need spankings NRR

You know, I wasn't going to respond to this thread on general
principles, especially since this brings out SUCH inflammatory emotions
in some people...  And the actions of the parents in this example
weren't strictly defined.

But I tend to agree with siphon, I think that when you are not a parent,
and you are in public that you really should give the benefit of the
doubt to the parent... Of COURSE when an infant shows OBVIOUS signs of
abuse then something really should be said.

Many children are not receptive to "voice commands" (they aren't
animals, My dog doesn't always respond to my commands, and I VERY RARELY
discipline him with anything NEAR forceful physical contact), many
children will take the opportunity to misbehave in unusual ways when
they are in public.  I have always felt that a certain amount of respect
is due elders, and strangers, and while I only ever felt my fathers hand
once in my life I think that it is not entirely unacceptable to enforce
your rules through the use of SOME physical force...

Now I cannot give these parameters, and it would be extremely difficult
to tell another parent what they SHOULD be...  Every parent needs to
shoulder the responsibility of defining them individually, and needs to
have the respect of society that they deserve as guardians.

(that said: people who abuse children are sick, they NEED the attention
of authorities, and society in general)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Monkey's are grabbing my ass

hahahaha l0l!!!! that's right, leslie went and started chasing after the
monkey and ran it up a light pole, which was weird because i've never seen
monkey run up a light pole. leslie being the young agile person she is
quickly stacked up some news paper boxes and tried to wrestle the monkey to
the ground, not having any luck, osby decided to start throwing rocks at the
monkey.

unforunately for the chimp, osby knocked it off balance and it landed on a
muni high voltage line, so then they had to call out the muni repair trucks
which was weird because i figured they'd just let the homeless guy keep the
corpse, but instead they gave it to osby and marked him down for one kill at
the zoo.

the reward money was for not letting leslie hump the monkey as she originaly
intended. all in all it was a weird night, hopefully they're able to capture
the rhino that got lose as well...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Seattle Clubs?


For Seattle try http://www.nwtekno.org.

I was just up there a few weeks ago but didn't find anything that looked
great but  we also went up to vancouver, CA ( 2hours away, and recommended) 
and had a blast at a few clubs.  We even managed to hit an underground there.

If you do end up driving to vancouver while in seattle, and of the
type try hitting up Blunt Brothers Cafe, or the New Amsterdam Cafe two
doors down.  Definatly will be a few raver types who can point you where to go
for music.

quick question how much is it normally? cause they do a weekly or bi weekly 
or some crap like that..

And there lineup looks the same as it always does just maybe 1 less room? 
Man NYE is the biggest scam in history.. same clubs,same DJ's just 2x the 
price.. and partying on nye is the same as any other fri or sat night?? Just 
a bunch of hype!

I say fuck paying $60 or $40 PNYE and $20 for CWK just take that cash and 
buy yourself a lift ticket and a cheap hotel and Board all day at sierra or 
Northstar! that would be alot more fun then going to a party believe that!

The worst is having played for *certain* promoters on NYE past, the door
price being 50$ or more, and still not getting paid one cent.... *cough*
harmony 2000 *cough*
Its a rip off unless its 5-10$ since it's the same dj's.. except arson. He'=
s
on fire ;P

Subject: [sfraves] new (house) mix

I know, it's been a while. My excuse is that Apple broke CoreAudio in a
previous version of OS X, rendering my digital audio interface unusable.
Anyway, they fixed it, so I'm "back in the game" or something. It's
a mixture of tribal, dubby, and tech house.

<http://mokshatribe.net/~allens/tribetech-2.0.mp3>

The tracklist:

1. Pepe Bradock - Le theme de Pierre le cosmonaute
2. Neon Lights - Gumbo! (Alexkid's Booyamix)
3. Nathan Scott & Gideon Jackson - Ow Dat Sound
4. Jay Tripwire - What Can You Do For Me?
5. Cutlab - Loudkissin' (Asad's Silverlining Smooch)
6. Grant Dell & Richie Littler - Disco Hit
7. eco-dope-ia - ? (white)
8. Patrick Turner - ? (Bluem 06 promo)
9. Jay Tripwire - Eat Your Bacon
10. DJ Foxx & DJ Sense - Hill Street Blues (Master D remix - ?)
11. Filth - Invisible Sunshine
12. Subsound - Beam Me Up
13. Soundbox - Boneyard (Terry Francis remix)
14. Tribalation - Why Did You Do That?
15. Dub Theory - No stop tha Dub

If you like it, let me know and I'll mail you a CD with a pretty label.

Subject: [sfraves] [bsp] LAST HALFLIFE AT AN SIBIN - TONIGHT - FREE!

hey all,
for those of you not in the know, the an sibin dj bar has been sold to new
owners, and due to their possible choice to disband several of the existing
nights, halflife chose to move to a new venue. thus, tonight will be the
last halflife on a monday night at an sibin, so please come by, give brooke
a hug, have a drink, and pay your respects to this long-lived dnb night.

myself and djsnm will be opening the night (as usual) from 9-10:30 with some
breaks infused mash-up goodness, and after that jest1 and his 510 and
halflife resedent lackeys take over.

remember, it's free. no excuse!

an sibin
1176 sutter street (x polk)
san fran, ca, us

see you tonight,
-xs

no fucking shit!  arson rocks the decks proper.  if you missed him this
last thursday at the DNA, you missed big.

my favorite part of the night had to have been the dancers tho.  my
friends were saying they looked like they all drove up from milpitas.

the best guy in the bunch kept shaking his fist at arson and pointing to
the decks and pretending to scratch the records.  what a dork.

Subject: [sfraves] Backpacks at Planet New Year?

Hey SFR,

The info line and website both say that NO BAGS OR
BACKPACKS are allowed at The Cow Palace for PNY
tonight.  Does anyone know if they strongly inforce
this rule?  Security usually doesn't mind when I bring
in my small bag, but I have never been to the Cow
Palace....so I don't know what to expect.

Does anyone know what security was like last year?

Thanks,
Sarah :-)

Happiest of New Years to Each and Every One Of You. May you have fun, get
wicked and enjoy a little debauchery in a safe and content environment...


Quotes for the end of the Year: 2002

The spirit of Plato dies hard.  We have been unable to escape the
philosophical tradition that what we can see and measure in the world is
merely the superficial and imperfect representation of an underlying
reality.
                -- S.J. Gould, "The Mismeasure of Man"


As long as war is regarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination.
When it is looked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular.
                -- Oscar Wilde, "Intentions"


"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain."
-- The Wizard Of Oz

Karina

School Breaks Pioneer )UK- Fuel, Sony, Myutopia- "SURROUNDED"  Album
Release Tour.

Part of the late-'90s drum'n'bass subgenre nu breaks, British
DJ/artist/producer/car aficionado Tipper became entranced by the style at
age 16, when his older brother turned him on to the whole rave culture.
Eventually growing bored with the fast tempos and repetitiveness of
drum'n'bass, Tipper began to experiment with new tempos leading to his
debut album, The Critical Path, in 2000 on the Higher Ground/Sony label.
During the making of the album, Tipper began to suffer from hearing damage
due to the elaborate and booming stereo systems inside his cars. With the
problem sorted out, Tipper returned a year later with his sophomore effort
(and first for the Pandisc label), Tipper Presents Sound Off, which
eventually led to tours of both Europe and America.Tracy Little John Rob

Thursday, January 2, 2003 ** Weekly: Kit Kat **

(Every Thursday Night) - Kit Kat introduced the weekly party concept to
San Francisco in March 1989 and against all odds established itself as the
only Thursday night party worthy of a monster sweat. Today Kit Kat sits on
a Richter proof funk foundation which is shaken to the core by local
fanatics determined to dance their ass off. This party has inexplicably
managed to elude the weekend warrior virus and has a balls to the wall
energy behind it. By default The End Up provides a comfortable who cares
what you are wearing atmosphere, so all attitude inevitably gets checked
at the door. The party gets started right away and peaks when the local
after hour posse swings on to the dance floor and pushes the elevator
above cloud line in the nick of closing time.

The knobs are manhandled by resident DJ Marc Jellybear whom in turn passes
the closing baton to rotating guests Simon, Garth, Miguel Migs, Jonene,
Wyatt Earp & John Howard. In addition the club hosts monthly special
events with the next level of over hyped DJs that have been, however,
thoroughly Kit Kat tested and do in the end justify having to pass the hat
around for business class airfare.

Overall a guaranteed must call in sick in the next few hours experience.

Ooops, nice site (I like the merchandise), and I started to order something 
until I suddenly realized, wait a minute, this IS NOT MY sfraves! (duh)...
Ummm, watch out folks, it should be obvious by the lack of the 
hyperreal.org, but some of you might not recognize it until later.
Unless there is something going on that I don't know about, like a new 
site? I don't think so, I mean, I know Karina redesigned the sfraves 
interface, but this dot com site is someone else's baby.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] .com merchandise

SFRaves.com Belongs to Vorg Entertainment. Long ago, they promised to turn
the domain over to Brian B, but they decided that making money would be a
better idea. So, there are two different sites... Sfraves.org is
non-profit, and Sfraves.com is for-profit (via overpriced tshirts &
accessories and banner advertisements).

Have a great new years everyone!

It should be noted that the merchandise on this site is in no way 
affiliated with sfraves.org or hyperreal.org, the merchandise linked to 
comes from the .com site...

And for a different side of David Lynch, check out "The Straight Story."
It is, and it's great.

looking to stay in the city, after hours/all night, and the cheaper the
better. any ideas are greatly appreciated!! 
THANKS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
