I finally got more of those earplugs I like -- they are my absolute 
favorites so far.

They are made by Howard Leight company, Santa Monica 90404.
They are rated at 30dB. This is with an assumption of ambient volume of 92dB.
I have the chart showing attenuation at different frequencies, along with 
the standard deviation... if anyone wants it, ask and I'll post it.

We got these earplugs (model Max Lite R-LPF-5-RO) at a gun store in Sac.. 
they run about $2.50 for five pairs, unless you get them at Uncle Ralph's 
in Berkeley, where they are $3.00 for *one* pair.

It seems to me that the real reson that the permit was revoked was the
simple fact that there were about 700 people at sunset.

With this many people and absolutely _no_ security, they feel like it is
a tragedy waiting to happen.  I'm sure the fact that someone was spaced out
on drugs merely provided the excuse to close sunset.

I know Galen and others also had misgivings about  continuing the party
at Berkeley Marina also because they felt that the party was becoming too
"popular".  He we can clearly see the problems with regular free outdoor
"renegade" parties.  Once they become predictable then you get people who
want to come for other reasons then to party, be they "gangstas" or 
"undercovers".  I think Galen has done a good job and also has shown a
Large City Police Department some very positive sides of the scene.

My feeling is that even if there were undercovers there watching people,
they would have to be total indoctrinated zelots not to see the love and
caring and natural happiness of the crowd.  I'm sure some of them have compared
what they saw to what they would see in a bar or night club and I know
at least some of them should have been moved.  I think that Galen and the police
have an understanding and even though the parties may not continue there,
I hope that maybe Galen has built a bridge between our community and
"law enforcement".

Yeah, as long as there aren't any incidents that make them look bad, they
were willing to tolerate it.  But when someone else call them to the scene
then they have to respond and file a report and the report becomes official
so they can be held accountable for what happens.

Here is the problems with these types of parties, you don't want to be
exclusive but when the party becomes easy and reliable to find, the you
get all kinds of "unwanted attention", this, among other things has
been one of the major problems with the FMR.  One way to eliviate
gangstas and police is to start your party on a _LATE_ weeknight.  The
police are usually not overly active and most gangstas will be passed
out once the liquor stores close at 2, they generaly aren't in the mood
by that time to do any long road trips just for amusement.  It also
keeps the numbers down.  The last couple of Full Moons have been pretty
good.  The Sacto full moon was without incident, it started around 3
am.  The delta full moon also started around 3 and was a success.  The
most recent Berkeley Full Moon started at 2:30.  In all of these cases
the police of the city were aware that a party was taking place and
allowed it to happen.  Once an incident occurs, they can no longer
"ignore" that it is happening.  Ok course the bad part of this is that it
weeds out a lot of cool people who just can't stay up that late (and go to
work the next day) this is unfortunate but necessary.

I went to this house party at 506 Haight last night.  It was pretty cool, 
but really smokey.  At some point the cops showed up, but the guy at the 
door must have played it cool because the cop never actually made it 
inside the house.

I *finally* met John Draper ("finally" because I rarely meet sfravers) 
and I was going to give him my email address, but no one had a pen.  Oh 
well, sometimes you just have to chalk it up to entropy and keep on 
truckin'.

For the police to enter a private residence, they need either a warrant 
or good probable cause to suspect that criminal activity is taking place. 
They are *not* entitled to enter without one of these. And having loud music 
is *not* probable cause.

I think it's best if we don't let them in to our parties, as then they 
will forget that they are doing so with *your permission* and will start 
to feel like they have a right to enter, which they don't.

I would like the opinions of others out there, though....

Subject: Sunset maybe not over
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


To whoever this may concern:

If you think that Sunset is over, then it's over.  Boy, what a pushover - that
was easy.  If I told you that because of a certain incident, partying was over
would you go along with that too?  
If someone destroyed their apartment in your building and the police said, "ok
that's it, everybody living in this apartment complex must move out because one
of you is rotten"  would you move out?

If Sunset is not at some other location, I might make it to the Marina with a
boom box.  I remember at the Sacto full moon, some cops showed up and everybody
started asking, "is it over?"  I said, "no way".  It continued without 
incident BUT if everybody had just thought it was over, it WOULD have been 
over.  You see, it takes two to tango (or not tango).

If you want Sunset to be over (read, if you believe Sunset is over), then it 
will be over.  Let's not be sheep, leave that to the sheep and the sheep 
herders, and in my opinion, there's far too many of this kind living among the
human population.  Doesn't America pride itself on independent thinking?  Well
join the ranks of independent thinkers, if you aren't already - there's no
signing of a contract (unspoken or otherwise) required.  If you still have to
live within the context of rule-based society and dire consequences will result
if you blatantly don't follow, then wear sheep's clothing but keep your mind
free, else change the rules!

In my guess, there is probably one person responsible for revoking or
extending a "permit".  Are 300 people gonna bend to the will of one 
person?  If you want to play the game the way the rules have been set up around
us (ie. necessity for permits, etc.) then maybe someone can talk with love and
understanding and empathy to that one person responsible for revoking the 
permit and get him/her to change his/her mind.  You never know......

This is of course, assuming that Galen wants to continue Sunset at the Marina.
If he doesn't someone else can easily do it instead.  The wheels are rolling...


If you haven't already, then free yourself! if you want....

Just a note to encourage folks -- 
Metripolis should be a really good party -- I hope to see you all there :)
The decor is probably good -- Kairo does some nice banners.

DJ lineup is Dutch, Susan, DRC, Kristof, and Goa Gil.

seeya,

Maui

Susan is spinning from 10:30 to 12... (obligatory girlfriend promotion :) )

try caldecott park, last exit b-4 tunnel on 24 east.

remember, though, that oakland cops are already hip because of 
floppy's & the problems the jack london club generated.

All the stuff that used to be at techno.standford.edu was moved
to hyperreal.com back in July.

Stanford basically wanted their machine back, so Brian set up
a new site.

	I think you give a lot of cops too much credit here. From my 
experience, once crime (including the use of drugs, no, especially the 
use of drugs) enters the picture, cops tend to over look what else may be 
going on. All the 'love' associated with the rave is only a drug induced 
lose of control (or something to that effect), not real love, or even 
real caring... Just a bunch of societies useless getting "their fix" (a 
quote from some woman on the Berkeley police force after our stereo had 
been stolen, the implication was where there is crime, it must be caused 
by those evil drugs). While the Berkeley cops might be lax about a bowl 
or two, they do not seem to take the same view on e's and trips. While I 
do not mean to harsh directly upon the police force (maybe I do, I am not 
quite sure), I do not believe that they would necessarily be overcome by 
the 'pseduo-love' that these deviants of society believe they have 
found... While they might come to an 'understanding' with us or the people 
who bring the parties together, it does not have to be a result of 
understanding what goes on (except that it does not seem to be violent 
and mentally disturbing to others).

	If a cop shows up you shouldn't even let them see inside the
door. Open the door, step outside, and close it *LOCKED* (make sure you

 i know as one who posted to have a moment of silence, i didnt mean it as
thats the end to partying. what i was trying to say was lets give a 
moment of reflection on what a cool party it was and then move on.

  i dont think anyone here is saying all is lost cause one party ended.

I wasn't at this party late -- Susan & I left after her set - but it 
looked like a really good night in the making.... I do wonder why the 
ventilation was so poor though -- I had assumed that a functioning 
nightclub would have better air-handling capacities, and I thought the 
Troc's to be woefully inadequate... is that par for the course?

ps: it was so nice to  see Mike, Jim, Lee An, Laura, Brian, DRC, Larry, 
Tricia, Cathy, Nora, Aaron, Jen.... lovely familiar friendly faces...

the reason it took them so long to react is because its the 
berkeley police dept. galen was dealing with.  because of their 
history of dealing with large crowds (demonstrations, riots, 
frats, faires, etc.) they are "hip" shall we say to feeling the 
vibe of a large group and reacting only as necessary.  this is 
what makes the loss of the marina location hurt even more.  it 
happened in a place where the police were probably quite 
willing to let it go on indefinitely with little or no hassle 
as long as we were responsible for ourselves and each other.  
as a long time berkeley resident i know this to be true.  thnx 
galen for a beautiful summer vibe.  thnx everyone else for 
sharing in the healing that will have to take place in the face 
of this major f*ckup by the group (we owe it to each other to 
share responsibility. we are each others keepers).  let's start 
the healing now.

peace&positivity,

  Who was that referee?  I really liked the set by the DJ spinning early
  wearing the B & W stripped shirt. Got me dancing early!!  Lots of synthes
  whirling and swirling over the beat... dance dance dance... 

  Who ever you are - good job.. !!!


  Now if I could just clear my throat - I feel like I smoked a pack of
  cigs! They need more air or less smoke! Maui was right - more air
  flow needed .... cough, cough...

I'm so sad there's no sunset party today, esp since i couldn't make it out
to megitripolis!  i want to dance!  it was so great to go out to the marina
(just a few blocks away from the lab, where i am right now & where i some-
times have to work EVEN ON THE WEEKENDS...ah, for a real job! or no job at
all!) and let galen and solar and all the guys transform me into a happy
dancin' fool.  

Does Pacific ever get to read this? if so, i just want to say: thankyou so
much for doing the marina party!  it was so much fun and you guys are the
greatest!  i hope you keep doing the party & don't get discouraged by recent
events.  you are all so together, so full of positivity, so totally right
on that i _know_ you will make it happen, whatever you decide to do.

lots of love,

That dj was DRC.  I think she is a really hot dj.  She kept me dancing
through her entire set.  2 guys came all the way from LA just to hear her
spin.  Well worth it.  Then came Dutch.  Again he was very good at the
beginning of his set then he switched to some more house music
(unfortunately it kind of slowed me down).  He had a great mix of Sven
Vath's new release "Harlequin-beauty and the beast".

All and all I enjoyed myself *alot*.  Good variety of people.  I think
Kairo did an outstanding job with painted panels and all the decor.  I left
quite early (2:30)ish.  Did the music pick-up after the belly dancer
performed her candle dance?

I enjoyed seeing many sfravers.  Hope I would have met some new ones.  I
was the one wearing the crude "F*ck La Mode" black T shirt.  It means
"screw fashion" in french.  It did get too hot right away, took one layer
off which helped a little.  I was also surprised at the poor ventilation.

In two weeks Alex will be spinning there.  He also spins some wicked

Yeah, the smoke was weird to me; I'm used to parties that are Smoke Outside.
And for that matter, parties with those things that spin that move air 
around. Distinct lack thereof, in my opinion.

I really enjoyed seeing all the sfravers I *did* get to see -- I'm still 
looking for the rest of you...:)

Megatripolis  -  nice!

 I didn't stay all the way through until 6AM , but I enjoyed it while
I was there. It was a night of firsts for me.

 First , I had never been to the Trocedero before. I was told that the
decor last night was special for Megatripolis - a facinating environment
of banners , hangings , a big gong , and a few little altars.

 Of course , it was the first Megatripolis in S.F. for everyone. From
a flyer picked up there , it seems that it will be held every week.

 I finally got to hear and see Frazier Clark. He had a short speech at
10:30 , where he explained the Megatripolis concept to us -  given the
concept of a future perfect human state called Megatripolis - how  
would the Megatripolitans behave , and treat each other ? Megatripolis
in San Francisco  would be a space for us in the present to emulate 
with our behaviour how these future beings of this perfect future
would treat each other. 

 I also got to hear John Perry Barlow for the first time - the guy who
discovered the term "pronoia". He gave a short speech about himself and
his philosophy - I didn't catch everything , but there was one idea
that I managed to write down ... if there is a lot of bad shit in
your life , it's the sucking backwash of an impending wave of positive
magiacal energy. With the recent death of his wife , he is personally
putting this to the test.

 After the speakers were a dance group , but I was upstairs listening 
to Susan , and missed them. The music upstairs and downstairs was good -
upstairs turned into a kind of ambient/house/trance space , while the
main floor was the harder stuff. ( I'll leave the DJ reviews to others ).

 I never got to the other warehouse site - how was it?

 I left at about 2:30AM , around when the vendors started packing their 
wares. Bought a book from AK Distribution , then left.

 Lots of positive , friendly energy in the crowd. I met a guy in the line
named Steve who was new to San Francisco , and this was his first rave
event. I couldn't think of a better club style event for loosing one's
rave virginity! 

	Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com 

PSes - Hi Fred! * To fellow sf fan Mike ( I hope I got your name
 right ) , I hope you get that multicolor LED wand idea working! 
 *  Who's flicking message LED toy was that? * Susie , thanks for 
 my first every blowpop ( courtesy of Fred )! * Maui - pay attention
 to those landmarks next time!

Ann Loraine emotes:

> to megitripolis!  i want to dance!  

och, me too.  I tried to go to megatripolis but got there too late, around
midnight and stood in the back of a long line waiting to get in.  When a
guy came out around 1 and announced that they were not going to let anyone
in after 2 am, I decided I wasn't going to make it and took off.
Megatripolis did give out 2 for 1 passes for the next week (I assume they
will have a door next week) for anyone left in line.

Sigh.  I was hoping to hang out there all night because, for the weekend,
I have no place to sleep.  Fortunately, as I walked out of the line, one
of the many friends I called that day paged me with a couch to crash in 
offer.

Stupid me, I don't have any techno to listen to 'cause I packed it all into
storage in a rush to evacuate.  The storage place is closed today too.  All
I have to listen to is Live 105 and a Metalica CD.  

I don't mind being homeless for 48 hours.  But no techno?  It makes my
purple fuzzy heart hurt.

Purple Tiger

ps Not having something makes you realize how important it is to you, so
I'm happy for the lesson.

hey,

 Megatripolis (sp?) was a good event all in all.

  for me tho it took awhile to get really into a groove. i enjoyed
Christophe's set the most and it had me up the whole time
   And watching the Hard Trance dj who spun with the DAT's
(cant remember his name) was a truely different expereince.

:)

peace love and all that

Susan & I are going to Europe in December, and I was wondering if anyone 
on the list had one of those lil' gadgets that do translation. Given that 
we will be in London, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels; French would seem to 
be the optimal language to use, and the only languages I can follow are 
Italian and Spanish, with a smattering of French and Japanese.

That reminds me -- does anyone else have a hard time with certain languages?
I can't seem to learn German at *all*, yet totally foreign-to-English 
languages like Japanese can take root.

Needless to say, any gadget we borrow is guaranteed against theft, 
breakage, and loss.

	Since coming back to SF in June, I had been depressed about the 
overwhelming number of dance-while-staring-at-molecule-five-feet-in-front-
of-face-and-two-feet-above-everyone's-head partyer goers (No cut to any 
of you who might dance this way, just I am one of those 'annoying' people 
who make eye contact with everyone that happens to be around, if I can). 
At the beginning of Megatripolis, I felt I was in for another one of 
these nights of being an individual dancing with a bunch of individuals. 
A pleasant surprise was instore for me as Goa brought out some nice 
hiEnergy stuff which seemed to bring everyone out of their shells, or at 
least a lot of people out of their shells.
	Was also quite happy to find another whistler out there 
(if you are on this list, hello once more brother of high pitched 
noises), although I had someone tell me that whistles were uncool and 
passe and to just never blow the damn thing (her experience had far 
out-wieghted mine, she made clear).
	Aye, so thanks to everyone who was there and made the evening 
what it was. No thanks to the group of Brits who hounded certain people 
and ended up basicly stealing a bit of cash from someone...

my beloved SkyWriter, companion to me as a child.
:)
my thoughts of Megatripolis..
i wish we'd been there earlier to see all of DRC's set, she rocked..
heard some nice east-coast favorites to keep me thinking of home..:)
all in all it was realy nice to hear something over 126 bpm...:)
*but*. and this is my jjbig cheese here since i moved, is that i still have 
yet to hear any music at parties with melody. Being the thing i like 
best, there seems to be a lack of real melody in the music i've heard 
here (except a bit tonight), at least some sort of rhythmic hook...i 
dunno, this is just me babbling..i guess that's why i should start 
spinning myself. :)
but..i'd list the people i met at this party if i could remember all your 
names, so i won't mention anyone as i can't remember everyone. :)
but hope to see you all again sometime soon, possibly next week at 
megatripolis..
mikebee


ps...the Squishy Designs West Hotline/Loveline (4 your pleasure) will be 
up as of wednesday...but not until then..if you'd like to hear the

I have a xlator that doe japanese,spanish, french, and german. it cost
about $50.00 and is very useful if you know how to conjugate japanese
verbs properly.

I speak hebrew, spanish, and japanese.

I would say that its worth it.

When I first go there, it seemed like a pretty mixed and mixed up crowd in
many ways.  I was thinking to myself that it would be an 'individualistic'
kinda chaotic night, but as I walked around I realized that the sfr quotient
was high(Hi!) and knew that this would take off eventually.  I tried dancing
to the fast stuff, but this cold I've been trying to kick kept me off the
dancefloor till later.  This was cool though because I spent more time
upstairs talking and grooving on the chiller stuff.  Overall, pretty good
first party.  The question is, how much will it be next week and will I
(you,we) go?

Thanks for your reply. However, I quite clearly stated that I wanted to 
*borrow* a translator. I am just too broke to actually shell out $50 for one.

     Raverfolk,,,
     
     WOW! Megatripolis was just so awesome! The trance cauldron DEFINITELY 
     lived up to it's title. The energy was so great, and it was great to 
     meet a bunch of you that I havent seen for a while! Apart from the 
     visuals that didnt get setup on time ( lasers, I should say ), it was 
     just *perfect*.. 
     
     Was I dreamin', or was this the best rave I've ever been to?
     
     BTW, The dj'd played in the order DRC, Dutch, Goa Gil, and finally 
     Christophe.... I loooooveed all their sets..but IMHO DRC and Dutch 
     played some wicked stuff ( no pun intended :) ).. Also, the dj mixing 
     with what I thought was MiniDiscs was Goa Gil... They were MDs , and 
     not DATs right?
     
     Well, cant wait for the next one!
     
     Rave on,, and keep smilin' folks!

You'll find that in France, Germany and Holland that a lot of people speak     
English -- especially people who work in hotels, restaurants and other service
industries.

You can probably get by with a French/English dictionary.  (I've found that
phrase books are useless cuz they are never complete enough.  With the
dictionary, at least you have all the words in the language at your disposal.
Vocabulary is much more important than grammar.)

They were DATs.  2 Sony TCD-D3's and a TCD-D7 (just like you see hundreds
of in the taper pit of any Grateful Dead concert).

Great stuff coming out of them too!

(I do have to wonder, how do you beat-match DATs???)

Megatripolus report
-------------------

   This Saturday evening,  the opening of Megatripolus West.    This is the West
Coast edition of the Megatripolus club in London.

   It was held in two places,   one across the street from the Trocadero in a small
warehouse.    The warehouse opened about 7 pm,   where people spoke and talked about
the following.

  ** Freedom and the constitution
  ** Hemp clothing and fashion show
  ** Help food and other materials from hemp.
  ** I talked on Cypherspace and protecting your privacy.
  
   After that,   people were lounging around,  waiting for the club to open around
10 pm.    The lines formed early,   and due to the popularity of the event,   some
people couldn't get in.  ID's WERE required,   but I think you had to be 18 to get
in.    After 2 am,   anyone could get in.

   In the downstairs front section,  there were food vendors,  selling sushi,  cookies,
and hemp food.    Upstairs, they had the chill out sections,  with these small little
cubby holes around the wall,  for people to sit inside and on top.

   Them was the main dance area,   which initially started up with house music,  but
was interrupted by a speach my Frazer Clark and John Barlow.    After that,  the music
started and I wasted NO TIME in getting out there and dancing.

   About the only really bummer part of Megatripolus were these two English dudz who
kept bugging me and asking who was selling drugs.  They were especially pushey,  and
really loused up my head space.   I followed them around for a while and noticed
that they didn't dance,   they busted someone for pot,  and were constantly moving
around.   If they were narcs they were doing a piss poor job of it.   They eventually
left about 3 am.

   The sound system was totally insane,   except when the front speaker system would
cut in and out.    Eventually,  they fixed it.   When Goa went on,  the energy level
shot up about 3 notches,  and friends that told me they had to go home,  decided to
stay.    It was the most brilliant set that Goa played...   Later,  the music was
interrupted for some kind of ritual,  but eventually started up again.

   People were allowed in and out,   but once it got filled to capacity,  they
weren't letting anyone else in.    Security people were rude and pushey,  and
were even hostile to people working at Megatripolus and their promoters.  For
instance,  when I wanted to go to the warehouse to find someone with diskettes,
I had to wait about 35 minutes to get back in,  yet before I left,  I was assured
that there would be no delays.

   Ventilation was very poor,   and little or no relief from smoke and the heat,
dispite the fact that the Troc has fans (Which they didn't put out),  and a
very powerful air conditioning system which they didn't turn on.    Later I
was told that the bar wanted to sell more drinks.   After 2 am,  water was NOT
FREE,  and costs 50 cents (No refills).

   The vibe was awsome...   VERY GOOD VIBE... Highest SFRaver quotent I've seen
in a long time.   Lots of smiles, love and joy.

   Although this FIRST edition of Megatripolus was free,  the next one will cost
$10.    Will you still go?

Here's my score (on 1 - 10 scale)

Vibe:   9
Chill out opportunities:  3
Music:  9
Sound system:  8
Chill Zone: 6
Visuals:   None
Decore:  8
Security:  2

The music was neat, though a bit fast for me at the time.  I really 
enjoyed the last set, was that Christophe???  He slowed it down so that 
was nice.  

phun to see phuture, "Sea of Sin", andrew from boston, and others who i 
hooked up with but don't remember your name just yet...

first went to dhouse's pad and played with records...every house i seem 
to go to these days has turntables and a mixer.  is this the future???  
also went to my friend ken's house after they kicked us out on our butts 
at 6am and listened to 2 nervous acid songs being mixed carlos style.  

more later probably have to run off to class--->deepfog

Uh-huh.

He said that they weren't likely to start up again until after the new
year. (This was on Friday)

Ahhh!   But that fast stuff opens up a lot more dance possibilities...
Plus it has a LOT HIGHER energy level   :-)

As with bongos, it just depends on whether the whistler can blow on beat.
Sadly, many don't and it can become tediously annoying quite quickly.
Although, I was listening to some song the other day and wished I had a
whistle...

I had a fine time at Megatripolis, and hope that they do many more parties here.
Getting to see & hear Goa Gil was a real treat.  The music was a lot faster than
what I usually get to dance to, and I like that!  Lotsa dancing smiling people!

And a sushi bar!  (Sushi and fast techno under one roof! Yowza!)

>   About the only really bummer part of Megatripolus were these two English 
dudz who

Each of them asked me if I had any E.  I asked each of them why everybody 
asks me that.

If a narc dances too much, he loses his capacity for being a narc, y'know.

>   People were allowed in and out,   but once it got filled to capacity,  they

The guy at the exit did at least warn us that we'd have a l-o-n-g wait to 
get back in.
That convinced me that I didn't really want to leave after all.
They did have a visit from the Fire Department before the party started.
I suspect that they didn't have much choice about how many they could let in 
at a time.

>   Ventilation was very poor

That was my only complaint.  I did find a few spots that seemed to get 
cross-ventilation
when the exit doors opened from time to time.

> After 2 am,  water was NOT FREE,  and costs 50 cents (No refills).

Downstairs.  If you went upstairs, you could get all the water you wanted from
the drinking fountain.  The guy at the upstairs bar even gave me a cup to 
fill there.

That was my first time at the Troc, and I thought it was really nice for a club.

hey there fellow whistler!  

it wasn't me but i love blowing my whistle too :-) .  i like to 
try to be rhythmic, not just blow it in people's ears.  carlos 
got me started doing it.  in fact the whistle i blow today was 
given to me by carlos at mr. floppy's 4 yrs ago.  definitely 
part of my rave gear.  carlos now hates it as much as anybody, 
but i'm hooked!   hear ya later...

Not a chance in hell. I cannot in good faith give my money or
otherwise attend spaces that treat their patrons with contempt.

While I can't blame a promoter that has the misfortune of selecting a
space and finding out the night of the party that the spaceowner is
going to screw things up, I *do* blame promoters that reuse such
spaces. These promoters are dogs; they don't give a shit about people,
they only care about green paper. "Blah blah blah...it's the only
space we could use blah blah blah." Good promoters would rather not
throw the party at all than throw it and screw people.

Good promoters try and provide ventilation. They give you free cups
(at a cost to them of maybe $.01-$.02 each) and free water. They allow
you to walk outside and cool off. They make you stand in line only
once. They're polite at the door and genuinely glad you came.  They
have a smoking area that is not the main dance floor.  They don't turn
the sound up to hearing damage levels, and when problems arise they
try their best to fix them.

Every party I have been associated with has had these things. All of
them have been hailed as having a great vibe, and none of them have
lost money.

That's why you don't see me often at big parties. They're usually a
collaboration between asshole promoters and asshole spaceowners that
don't care about their patron's health, just their money. To those
that are the exception, you not only have my gratitude and respect,
you have my attendance.

How you treat your people sets the tone for your whole party.
Promoters make the difference, and loving promoters have made some
wonderful things happen. The "rave scene" will die off eventually as
it recedes like every other fad dominated by money. But the small
parties and other parties thrown for the love of it -- they'll live on
and on, as long as people want to share the love and music.

Put your money where your heart is.

Sean

Yeah, and boy, are my arms tired! :) :) :) :)

I basically have enough $$, barely, to go and come back. I don't even 
know where I'm gonna crash anywhere except London, where Django has said 
we can stay. I'm probably going to sleep on Susan's parent's floor, since 
they are going around the same time. If anyone has contacts in Amsterdam, 
Paris, or Brussels, let me know. We would be delighted to have *them* 
crash *here* in return... we have a very comfy futon and a hell of a 
view. I can even cook for them!


Happily yours,

Maui

	The temp in the Troc was not too bad in my opinion, but then I 
quite like to get a good sweat worked up (except I need a second shirt 
when a I leave, and the car windows get all sweated up as I try to drive 
home). When its hot, those spray cn/pump/whatever they are feel quite 
good as well, and those who had them on Saturday night brought out many 
smiles. I do however, assume that I can get unlimited free water in such 
a case which was not really the case on Sat. (except I got a cup when 
they were still free and held on to it, filling it in the bogs...) I 
didn't reallyt see/feel much smoke in the air. Granted it was not 
outside, but I have yet to get to a party where people get like they did 
during Goa's set (dancing/jumping/yelling/looking at each other/.....) 
under a sky which wisks your mind aomng the stars....

Cyclone is a largish warehouse space that has been a going concern for 
quite a long time now. That means it doesn't get hassled by cops! It 
reminds me of Komotion, except that it is definitely larger. But like 
Komotion, the inhabitants are your peaceful cool anarchist types who also 
do punk shows.
Inside is pretty trippy -- the residents have their own individual 
loft-cubicles, which are suspended from the ceiling and only accessible 
by various ladderlike structures and catwalks. They're pretty 
cool-looking; it's hard to keep people off 'em :) So far I haven't had a 
problem with that, since there's only one way up.

This space also has a skateboard ramp(!) which we've been using as sort 
of a chill space.

If anyone wants to help out, we could use more cloth hangings to isolate 
different areas -- doesn't have to be fancy or anything. Just let me know...

Happy to answer questions :) .....

Maui

Why is seeing/hearing Goa Gil such a popular thing?  I've ended up seeing
him on both of my visits to SF, not that I made an effort to see him.  
IMO, he's not a spectacular dj.  Was he one of the first SF dj's or something?

I had a killer time.  It was big (yay, big is fun at times) it was fast
(yay!  I love fast techno) there were tons of sfravers (yay!  I love
my net-family) it had intellabeams (I've missed them lately).

Now I have something to do on Saturday nights.  As long as the price
doesn't go above $10 I'll be back!

EXCEPT for *this coming Saturday night* 'cause it's Your Sisters' House.
In case anyone is wondering, I'm spinning last so make sure you get
a good night's sleep the night before (or drink lots of coffee).

well, yes, that's what i've been told by people that love the fast 
stuff.  but I like stuff that's below maybe 140, because i can hear all 
of the instruments (well, electronically generated natural sounds)  more 
clearly.  I guess that's why I liked the last set more.  I also spoke to 
other people who felt the same as me and had retreated to the ambient 
room with shields at maximum.  I wouldn't be surprised if the rave scene 
started splitting into subscenes (hardcore, gabber, fast trance, 
tribal).  I've heard that is what it is like in Europe.

Goa Gil (from what I remember) came out to SF over 2 years ago (Summer of
92) for a party called Planet Groove.  I didn't go but I remembered his
name on the flier, because the place he came from India, and up til then I
hadn't heard of any djs from Asian countries.  Apparently he made his mark
by playing massive (3000+ people) full moon raves on Anjuna Beach in India.
The summer of 92 was sort of the dawn of techno in SF, and since then I've
heard Goa Gil's name out here only sporadically.

Goa apparently plays off of DATs, and I think there's some kind of digital
equipment that he uses to beatmatch/cue tracks to some degree.

Personally, anything over 125 bpm is way too fast for me.  Call me an old
fogey... :)

I realize some people like the more technoey, fast above 145 stuff.  I 
just personally don't care for it for long periods of time, so I had 
trouble getting into it as much.  That's why I think the scene will kind 
of naturally split up into faster---slower, maybe?

Overall, it was a good party.  I like the Trocadero, because it seems to 
have a good sound system, and it has an upstairs chill space which is 
lacking at the King St. location.  However, there were 2 things which I 
thought needed pointing out (maybe someone could pass this on to the 
people that ran this show):

SOUND-  Way too loud.  Everywhere I went in there, I could hear the 
little hairs in my ears falling out.  I wanted to go in the main dance 
area, but couldn't because I was afraid of ear damage.  Now I know it can 
be improved, because I went to one of Martin's events (Vision) in May and 
the sound was EXCELLENT.  And he had more speakers in there.  I had no 
problems that night.  Take some lessons on how to use sound properly or 
pass out earplugs at the door.  

ENDING-  First of all, it ended VERY abruptly.  At 6:00, the "zippies?" 
spoke and I felt like the way they were talking, we were supposed to 
worship them and feel like they are taking over the sf bay area.  then 
they said "get out".  I really don't like it when clubs just kick you out 
on the street after the party is over, because it breaks the unity of the 
crowd.  if they had just given us an extra half hour to chill and say 
goodbye to all our friends (they could sell muffins and juice, make more 
money), it would be much more human.  the BEST party i went to brought 
blankets and let everyone chill with free fruit and muffins and coffee.  
I am not saying they have to do that to make it a good party, but just 
immediately kicking us out on the street with no transition left a bad 
taste in foggy's mouth (and other friends of mine so i know i speak for 
others).  Come on.  Let's try to be more personal.  

remember, this is just constructive criticism.  I basically had a great 
time otherwise.  Looking forward to making megatripolis part of the 
sfrave community.

Well I went to Megatripolus with lots of doubts but I have to admit that:

1) the music was great: we always complain about too much house or too much
techno (depending what you like) but Saturday there was a good variety and
I think that variety is the best.
2) the people were friendly and into it, I didn't see people with a club
attitude or weird just to be weird: everyone was doing his/her thing with
some respect for the others
3) security at the Troc is definitely very careful but they are nice people
4) visuals: well saying that I was pretty much sober, I really enjoyed trancing
out with the music and with the help of very trippy visuals
5) great vibes: I know it sounds like everybody always says that there were
great vibes but this time I got the impression that people were really enjoying
what was going 
6) ventilation: well if I compare last night to any Wicked lately I have to say
that it was great. This is another issue were people have different point of 
view, some people like very sweaty places some other don't. Last night was
barable.

So I guess I will go again

	Take care

I got there late also and heard the guy announce no more entry after 
waiting in line for a very long time.  He decided to let five more people 
in and I was number 4.  Whew.  Double whew when I found I didn't have 
to pay any sort of fee! (had no clue it was a free event) The frisker 
dude did a real thurough job on me :

<grope> <feel> "What's this?"
  "Keys"
<poke> <poke> "I don't think so"
  <yank> <show> "Earplugs"
"yeah, those are earplugs"
"thanks"
Boy if they went through this with everyone I can see how that line got 
so long.

Walking into the troc this time was definitely a visual onslaught.  Full 
on disco mania with mirror balls and several spotlights spraying dots 
everywhere made the room really trippy, and the banners on every inch of 
wall made it homey and man-made, while the flashing multicolored lights 
in yer face was slightly nauseating, it was definitely an energetic 
display.  

I've never seen the troc more cozy.  Even the upstairs was
interesting with the cubby hole vendor booths, good use of space.  Lot's
of soft toys hanging from the ceiling, including a really cool foam fish. 
To me it didn't seem all that hot or smokey.  Compared to just about 
every other club in that area it was not bad considering the amount of 
people there.  Can you imagine a Wicked there?  They'd for sure hang 
their nappy army nets halfway up the ceiling just to bring that hot humid 
air that much closer to us.  

Did anyone else get pushed alot from people cutting through the floor?  I 
dunno what it was, maybe someone slapped a sign on my back that said 
"shove me, please" . 

Goa Gil's high bpm set was envigorating.  It seemed to not have much melodic
theme though... I mean there wasn't anything fancy that I recall from any 
of the songs except that it was VERY BOUNCY.  (actually that's about all 
I could do was bounce!) Also, I didn't notice he was beat matching 
really.  It seemed like one machine would have a few songs already mixed 
together, and then when it came time to switch machines he just slip cued 
it in... seemed kinda abrupt at times but maybe with so many beats 
already nobody cared if a few extra slipped by.

While it was great to bounce and stomp, I felt very relieved on the final 
set.  Maybe SF house music has finally hooked me, but Christophe really 
delivered.  It seemed like the crowd got back in touch with the DJ, 
hanging on to the energy of mixing.  People cheered a bit and threw up 
their hands with glee and started really swinging about on each new tune, 
yet there were still plenty of windows to mellow out in anticipation for 
the next burst.  What a way to end it.

OK< folks.  I hope you will ALL respond to this email.  I responded to 
Klaus Voss' post a few months ago and invited him out to stay in Santa 
Cruz, and he is very cool.  He had a great time at Megatripolis the other 
night, (though still recovering from jet lag and over 24 hours of 
traveling) but he would like to meet more sfravers and travel around a 
bit.  He is looking for a few people that might also be generous enough 
to let him crash at their place so he's not totally restricted to Santa 
Cruz.  So I ask all of you SuperDuperRavers <sfraves@hyperreal.com> can 
you please, please, please, please, please email me back and let me know 
if you would like to meet a Berlin raver?  you won't be disappointed.

Well I had the greatest time at Megatripolis.
I was unfortunate to get there late enough that I was told that
no one would be getting in, but so many people started leaving after  the line
after that that I got pushed up to the fron and was soon in... around 1:30.
I guess I'm one of those who loves that faster groove... so the music was sooo
good... much fun, and the people around me were just so into it that
I don't think I've ever bonded so closely with so many people..
During Goa Gils sertt perhaps, we were just holding each other and dancing
so hard that it was all we could do to scream.... yeah.  invigorating,
intense, life so pure... perfect.  I really felt at one with everyone,
most everyone anyway, maybe not the red headed girl jumping around dumping water on people...
but... one of my top parties.
I'll be there next week.
Also, a very interesting mix of scenes...
beyond your normal ravers...
I then spent the day with two great people, who I finally talked to
there... hello Kathy and Andrew if you're reading.
Weekends like that make s life perfect and my housemates (nonravers)

I too found the Troc quite stifling -- I just thought they didn't *have* 
air handlers. Finding out that they *do* have them and *didn't turn them 
on* was a big shock.
I also could have done without the SS-style security -- first of all, 
Susan had to stand there holding a very full crate of vinyl waiting *in 
line*. This also happened to the SPAZ posse, and Aaron in particular was 
pissed. They just simply didn't give *any* space for him & Jen to work with.

Next, after Larry Ching was sweet enough to help me find our car, we had 
to wait in line all over again, despite the fact that we had wristbands. 

Maybe it's just me -- I rarely go to clubs, but I've *worked* at them;
but the the nastiness of the security folk really took me aback.

*But*, from what I saw for the couple hours I was there, it was a pretty 
bangin' party. I only regret that Kairo had Susan and DRC spinning at the 
same time, so I had to keep running up and down stairs. All said, it 
*was* a fun party, and I will attend the next one, most likeley.

One fun part is that Mike Clay showed up with the same shirt I was 
wearing -- the "infinite detail" T's that Ethan gave us at F&F III :)

And I thought sushi was an interesting choice of edibles at a club/rave...

As far as I know, Kairo has never used that space before. And it's not 
likely that the first event at a new venue *isn't* going to have some 
problems that need ironing out.

To be honest, I don't the things that were bad about this party really 
had aything to do with the promoters. Of course,I was only there early 
(while DRC was spinning) but I do *not* remember the sound as being too 
loud. However, it certainly might have gotten that way after Susan & I left.

None of them have lost money? I think Ethan has shelled out quite a bit 
to make things happen; without financial compensation... don't know about 
anyone else except YSH -- we've lost plenty on that party. We just don't 
care :)

I agree with you completely here :)

Sean, you know I agree with you on these latter points, but I think it 
was unfair to Kairo and his associates to make critical judgements of them
without knowing the whole story,

What's going on right now is alot like what happened to the punk scene 
here in SF-- you had bands like Flipper (that are WAY grungier than 
anything that Seattle produced) and bands that grew out of the thrash 
metal scene. The slow element went one way, the fast element another. 
They've always both been here, though...

	This has been a trick (playing with the levels over the course of 
the evening so that the music builds in waves as well as increasing on 
the average to counteract the numbing effect, this last bit would be 
considered bad for your ears by most... including me) to make your 
experience more intense. Although it does not have to get up to levels 
that damage your hearing, I do enjoy djs that still pay attention to 
details this 'small'.

I agree somewhat that the sound was loud and unclear.  I found the sound
system inadequate in power.  I commented to someone in the middle of DRC's
set that there was way too much distorsion.  Usually an indication of lack
of power (clipping).  Then again it could have been a little of both, bad
speakers and lack of power.  (I'm not talking about volume here just
driving power for clean sound.)  The bass could have been just a tad
deeper.  Unless you were dancing near the stage, where bass bins were right
under the stage, it felt a bit anemic.

If I'm not mistaken I think Ethan mentioned something in a previous post
about the sound system being brought in from different productions group
each week.  That could be a blessing.  Could anyone confirm this? :)

Again, all in all I had a blast! :) :)

I thought Goa's musical selection was pretty cool, but his beatmatching was
almost non-existant.  You can't beatmatch DATs (or at least I have never heard
anyone do it).  Perhaps if he has a spare $5000 lying around he should
invest in a CD recorded and a Denon 2000 CD mixing system.  Then he could 
transfer his DAT material to CD and mix the CDs.

Good point! Sounds alot like the DJ disease kown as "creeping slideritis" as 
well. I too vastly prefer the smaller events -- I hadn't even *been* to a 
club since opening night for Sound Factory (which Susan & I left after 
half an hour).

Thanx for your response :)

goa gil is from india-much different cultural background yet

Goa Gil beatmatch?  Hah, and the sun will rise in the west.  No, he is
completely locked in to that style; he didn't beat match when he was
using vinyl either.  Non-matched mixing is still apparently fairly common
in Europe, from what I've been able to gather, and is actually making
something of a comeback on the east coast.  With Gil's style, it really
doesn't matter that much.  I've always liked him being around in the SF
scene because what he plays is so different than most everything else
being played, but really, I find it unemotional and static and hard to
dance to.  But that's fine, it gave me a chance to take a long break
on Saturday night.

As for sound levels, I didn't think they were all that bad, and I only
used my earplugs for short periods of time . . . and believe me, I remember
plenty of times when I went to the Troc and didn't take them out from the
moment I walked into the place.

not to rain on the parade or anything, but Goa Gil is, as far as I know,
a native of San Francisco.  He got the name because he has the means,
so I've heard, to do anything he likes, and one of the things he likes
is to spend half the year in Goa with the beach party scene there.
Chalk this up to unsupported rumor, but it fits his m.o.  

Having never been to Goa, again this is purely hearsay, but my understanding
is that it's primarily frequented by Europeans on holiday; it was actually
still a Portuguese colony until the early 1960s if memory serves.  Recently
there have been stories in the paper that the Indian government is building
a controversial railway extension into Goa, which will provide easy access
for the first time, and the locals are none too pleased about that.

I've seen Goa Gil spin maybe ten times.  It just hit me that the first one
was in June 1992 at a little underground party in what looked like a
little theater rehearsal space, maybe on Jessie St. or one of those mini-
streets south of Market.  Anyway, it was a pretty good party and the 
lineup -- you'll love this, this was back before the delineation of the
various musical styles was as strongly perceived -- was Carlos, Goa Gil
and an early version of Darwin Chambre (which is how they spelled it then).

I guess you're right.  I didn't realize that he wasn't into beatmatching...
nor that it was technically difficult to do so off DATs... I guess I was
trying to give him a little credit for his efforts.  Much respects to him
if he's out there doin' it hard.

i would like to strongly (let me repeat, STRONGLY) caution anyone from
using East Bay Regional Park District land.  In case anyone has forgotten,
21 people received citations that cost REAL MONEY in an EBRPD park on
August 5th. The authorities have NO sense of humor, the fine is expensive
(US$270), and is a misdemeanor (can you say, CRIMINAL RECORD?).  Please,
use extreme caution when using EBRP land.  Their parks are closed from
10PM until 5AM.  They mean it, and they enforce it.

 As the weather is getting more autumnal , I've decided not to do
lunch at Greer Park for the rest of this year. However , I would like
to organize an indoor South Bay Lunch , let's say for next week
Wednesday. Maybe at some restaurant in the area of Palo Alto or
Mountain View. 
 Please reply if you're interested! Also , please include suggestions 
if you know a nice place that has a good range of food and has
resinable prices and parking. Within a mile or two of a freeway would 
be nice too.

There have been several attempts to get a regular trance party going but 
so far none have really taken off. All summer long I get bombarded by 
europeans who ask where the trance {goa style of course} parties are .
They do not like that funky -groovy. Personally I think the best DJs in 
sanfrancisco play house- However some of the best records being made now 
are Ambient-techno-trance . I think it is easier to mix house 
beats. Techno songs have odd fractalized rythyms which confuse me. People 
who like techno buy the music and listen to it UNMIXED! I cant imagine 
doing that with house. Laura and Shoban are the two who I first heard 
play not-house in SF scince Mr floppies (i know there are others but 
during the early part of the sf rave scene (toontown times) i was in jail.)
Floppy people are part of the contingent of people in sf who prefer 
cosmic-acid-artsy-freaky to the funky-groovy. I felt their presence at 
the jupiter bash. SPAZ is my favorite protaganist of the techno freakout .
ethan,bryce, WBL, and all of ya'll get on it . Zippy-hype master Frazer 
Clark seems like a supreme egoist But he has brought the possibility of 
aan above ground trance party into being-His hype and lots of help from 
everyone else. I say MAKE IT HAPPEN so I can have a place to send the goa 
crazed euro-heads on a weekend. 

Besides techno is really cool on a big sound system!
and maybe some AMBIENT JUNGLE!!!!!

salutations, allen@ameba

        Reply to:   To Megatriopolis from Santa Fe, NM
My girlfriend Lisa and I moved here a couple of weeks ago from Santa Fe, NM, and
thought Megatripolis sounded like a great 1st SF rave. We weren't disappointed. 

We started the evening out catching the early show of Ollie Stone's "Natural
Born Killers" with some friends. Interesting movie, but I wouldn't recommend it
to anyone as a pre-rave picture. The on-location shots of New Mexico kinda hit
home with us. While traveling along route 666 (yeah, there is a route 666 in New
Mexico), the main characters snuff a Native American shaman. Lovely.

We got to the Megatripolis location around 10:00PM, like the vmail line
suggested. Talking to the people in line got us out of our Stone-induced funk,
and reassured us that the SF, CA rave community is every bit as friendly as the
New Mexico rave community. While in line, we all received complementary smiley
face erasers :-) in tiny zip-lock bags from people dressed in black hooded robes.
The topic of conversation immediately turned to whether there might be something
interesting on the erasers, but no one was willing to brave the taste to find
out, at least not out on the street.

Once inside, we were struck by the decor. Not overly high-tech, but quality and
creativity definitely triumphed over cost. 

The music was really diverse and most all of it was completely new to me, which
was exactly what I was looking for! From what I can gather, the lag time between
what you people hear out here and what arrives in NM is anywhere from 2 to 6
months, if it arrives at all. I hope your scene _doesn't_ fragment into sub-scenes
of house, gabber, techno, ambient, etc. The inevitable arguments over which
genre is better are far less interesting than just giving in to whatever moves
you. 

We were a little puzzled when the music suddenly stopped and some guy (who we
later learned was Frazier Clark) started making a speech. We couldn't understand
a word, and by the time we made it downstairs, he had finished. The next guy up
was evidently the originator of the "pronoia" concept, which from his
description seems pretty cagey. Anyone who has tripped hard at some point in
their lives can probably relate to the feeling of pronoia, that the universe was
set in motion for his/her personal enjoyment. It seems that it's where you take
this feeling that really matters. Certainly the main characters of "Natural Born
Killers" were in touch with the feeling (their drug, according to Stone, was
TV), it's just that they took it in a slightly less positive direction. In this
light, the PLUR concept discussed a few posts back seems more important then
pronoia. 

After the speeches were finished, a group of four made their way to the center
of the floor to spiritually initiate Megatriopolis. A shamanistic intro for a
techno-oriented club - we felt like we were back in Santa Fe!

The only let down of the evening was the sound system. I don't think it was the DJ's
fault or had anything to do with where the levels were set. The speakers sounded
like they were being underpowered, and like they were a decade to two too old to
handle what was being put through them. Couldn't tell if the bullet tweeters
hanging at the four corners of the floor were active, but their placement probably
wouldn't have helped things much anyway. Hopefully next week's $10 price tag
will allow for better systems in the future.

Once we've seen some different parties, we'll probably come back to
Megatriopolis. The vibe seemed to reflect a sincere generosity. Thanks so much
to all of you for pointing out a great first SF rave!

-nate






 I also got to hear John Perry Barlow for the first time - the guy who
discovered the term "pronoia". He gave a short speech about himself and
his philosophy - I didn't catch everything , but there was one idea
that I managed to write down ... if there is a lot of bad shit in
your life , it's the sucking backwash of an impending wave of positive
magiacal energy. With the recent death of his wife , he is personally
putting this to the test.

I went to a big punk rock kegger party there this summer.

If I this is the same place, it is near the water with a large
junk yard / sculpture / firepits area that the big warehouse door 
opens out to.  Has a very dirty city feel to it.  All you ventilation
junkies should be high as a kite.

Went to Mushroom Jazz (sunset withdrawals) last night.  Very hiphop
now - lots of slinky bellbottoms (I am so Easy).  If house seems slow
to ya then you'll just melt all over the dance floor here.  Felt like a
"regular crowd" has settled in with a good emphasis on dancing.  A mix of 
solo and social dancers.  The people were more diverse than I remembered.
Excellent crab cakes and brazilian salsa.
Essential tip: cheap beer at back bar.

OB fabulous glamour pusses -
heard rumors about the basement of 1015 this friday
anyone confirm?

Hey fellow sfravers.... We've got a great space, etc., but we have no 
sound. There were some folks who were supposed to do it, but they decided 
otherwise.... Can anyone out there lend a hand? We have willing folks to 
carry stuff, and Cyclone is a cinch to load in and out...

Maui

Ps: please please please :)

Of course!  That's what they're supposed to do.  Just trying to dance to

I do that, and try to mix it too (but I'm not good enough to inflict my

I'm afraid Maui has totally misread my post as an attack on Kairo. It
is not. And it does not matter whether I was at the party or not, if
eight people explain in excruciating detail what was wrong with it.

I don't have to witness the beating to be angry if a woman is
battered.

I don't have to be at the rave to be angry if the spaceowners abused
their patrons.

Read my posting again. I am angry at the spaceowners. Now if Kairo or
any other another promoter throws a party there--knowing how they treat
people--then it says that promoter is about money.

Finally, if one needs to use the word "you" a lot in a posting, TAKE
IT TO EMAIL!!!!!!

I was at Megatriplis (a perfect party- absolutely perfect) and saw
no beating.

Some insane guy forced his way through the exit door screaming and grabbing
people. The security guys got him, handcuffed him, and walked him upstairs
to the office.

Later I saw them walk him out. He was not beaten or bruised. They did
a fine security job- got him to the ground and handcuffed. Same thing
I did for years at shows.

BE CAREFUL with the East Bay Regional Park District -- get
permits and don't try to go renegade.  Liquid got caught and
slapped with $270 per person fines . . . but the people involved
got a lawyer and collectively bargained with the Alameda County DA
to reduce the fine to $50.

Wow Phred, I didn't realize not beat matching was a style -- and one
on a comeback even!  Now I have an excuse, especially since I'm
from the East Coast.

By the way, by "not beatmatching" I mean mixing over no-beat breaks
or something, NOT beat-crashing!  Sometimes it's just too hard to 
get two 150 bpm tracks with panning hi-hats to seamlessly beat mix.

See you all Saturday.  Bring me offerings of caffiene :-) :-)  (It's
a JOKE for the humor-impaired).

Barlow invented the term 'pronoia'?  That's new to me.

Thanks for the report Nate and welcome to SF, I'm pleased to see we have
some new people checking in here.  

The four 'bullet tweeters' you mentioned are (I believe) JBL drivers hung
from the ceiling.  They are the last vestige of what I believe to be the
most awesome medium size sound system I've ever heard.  The old Troc
sound system circa late 1992 used those tweeters and massive banks of
folded-horn subwoofers in each of the four corners of the room.  It was
a body-resonating experience, and yet unless the DJs were driving the
system too hard you could be in the large sweet spot in the middle and
get away without earplugs at least for a while.  I miss that physical
resonance, most of the systems now (except maybe the big room at Townsend)
can't do it cleanly although many try and end up distorting the sound.
To be fair, Shredder is the other system that really gives that effect
but I haven't been to a party where they've been used since the NASA
at the Galleria last fall.

I've waxed rhapsodic about the old Troc system and what little I know of
its, er, uh, interesting history, because it represents to me so far the
state of the art for club sound.  It taught me a lot about new concepts
in sound reinforcement, as well as underlining some old ones such as the
absolute importance of minimizing distortion to gain comfortable, clean
and loud sound.

Well,  I used to live up there at Parkwoods Apartments right up at the
Caldecott tunnel,  and there is a baseball field nestled up against hills
on all 3 sides.  Then  just down from there,  is a small recreational
lake Timescal Lake..

I can remember many warm nights where I've taken a walk up there (usually
after 11 pm).     Often,  I would get hassled by cops who wouldn't allow me
to just walk out there and enjoy the warm evening.    I would say,   at least
several times,  they would ask for my ID,  and my friend Bill went out there
alone,   and got socked with a $300 fine.   It is very heavily Pig infested,
but with Parkwoods apartments now gone (A victum of the Oakland hills fire)
I suspect it isn't patrolled that much now.    PS:  I moved out of there
about 4 yours BEFORE the fire totally destroyed the complex.

thanks maui for the flora-n-fona report on cyclone space
sounds really cool and i look forward to party and
dance there at ysh - someplace i am long overdue for.

my 2 bits on megatripolis, i had a good time there and
my friends liked it even better, ive been away from the
rave/techno/house scene for 3 months (i can't believe
i survived!) but the megatrip party was all that people say
it was - good time.  the hemp seed ice cream was good too!

i didn't find security too ss.  and don'r suspect a long
wait next sat. because its not free.  i may check it out
after ysh to catch the drum circle mentioned for next sat. 

stupid question: where is the dj pit at the troc, while
surfing the trance vortex, i had trouble finding where
the dj was for the main floor?  and was the troc once called
club X?  this was my first troc event.

For what it's worth, the first ever SFRaves picnic was held in May 1992 up in
a park around there.  Sound permit was $80 or so, the area couldn't hold more
than maybe 100 people if they carpooled, but it was a very nice area.  
I am pretty sure there are larger spots with more parking, too, though 
nothing approaching the intensity of Berkeley Marina.

                 does anybody remember the Eighth House? this was a pure 
trance club that tried to happen early this year but was squashed by the 
heavy overhead at club Oasis.well---it's happening again!it starts in a 
couple of weeks on sunday nights and will feature an ever changing 
selection of s.f.'s many TRANCE dj's.this will be a small club (200+/_)in 
contrast to megatripolis and will be inexpensive ($3) with a dancefloor 
and an ambient room.this is all i know right now , the fliers will be out 
soon......

Unfortunately, the last six parties featuring "Shredder" that I
attended had the sound much too loud. This had the effect of muddying
the music terribly from the excessive reverberation and distorting the
sound from being driven at clipping levels.

I used to think that Shredder meant the system shreds your head, but I think
it really means that it shreds up all the work put into creating and
mastering a good piece of vinyl. The end result is that all the songs
sound the same... like a Westinghouse locomotive at 10 feet.

I went to the first Eighth House which featured Laura and Mixmaster Morris. We
had a really good time for the most part, and the crowd was the coolest, most
eclectic crowd I've seen at an SF party.

yeah, I enjoyed everything but the troc itself.  the people doing security
and some of the people who either worked either for the troc or the event
*were* rude and pushy.  i was drinking a beer at 2AM, had 2 gulps left when
this girl in ripped up jeans tried to rudely grab it out of my hand, with
a cursory comment about "the rules".  after I said, "waitaminit, I'll
fuinish it now" she tried to snatch it out my hand again.  i basically
put my hand on her forehead, cartoon style, and held her back while gulping
1 of the 2 last gulps, and then gave her the other, her babbling about
"i'm kicking you out" etc., which i completely ignored.  i also saw what
appeared to be narc activity and the gen. attitude of the club and workers
was pretty hostile to the crowd.  the vibe of the crowd was good, but I'd
say I'll not be very excited to attend another event with 'workers with
attitude', specially not if I'm paying...

If the megatripolis promoter(s) are out there, PLEASE FIND ANOTHER VENUE!!!!

BTW, what's the story on komotion these days?  I'd *much* rather patronize
them!!!!

I didn't think the security was that bad, from what I saw.
When we were about to enter, security kicked out a kid for lighting a bowl,
but he was caught and kicked out.  Later on,
I saw two guys get caught smoking a joint, the security guy said, hey
you can't have that, put it out.  They put it out, and that was that, they
even got to keep their little roach...

Greetings, Ravers!

After much work, setup, and negotiation, we have finally worked out a viable
plan with Komotion to help bring you Friends and Family on Saturday, October
29th, as a celebration for ourselves, and the upcoming Halloween and Samhain
holidays.  We hope you'll join us in making this a wonderful SFR party for
all of our friends and family.  We are working with Komotion to make this
the coolest (literally) party we've had there.

We'd like to invite you to participate in making this event.  If you're an 
artist, musician, dancer, performer, poet, greeter, meeter, viber, wanderer,
body painter, altar maker, or have some skill you'd like to share with us,
we'd like to hear from you and work with you.  Please send some mail to
nrg@ultima.org, or to me, brycer@ultima.org.

Thanks!  see ya soon!

Larry, you missed it, it was Sept 21/22

Jesus H. Christ... smoking pot is f*****g illegal!!! The cops are swarming
around SOMA these days, and all they need is an excuse to close down a 
club for selling alcohol after 2AM or allowing drugs on the premises.
 
Just because the "vibe is good" and it's a rave doesn't mean that u can 
lite up a joint anywhere u want.. This ain't  f*****g Amsterdam! Go to 
the bathroom.. or find a dark corner. Maybe if we were more discreet about
taking drugs then the security wouldn't bother us as much... :)

	It's the pagan holiday for that time of year which the
Christians stole and turned into Halloween. (Just like Christmas and
every other holiday.)

He's not exactly a kid.  He's a student at UC Berkeley, his name is Chris,
and he's a cool guy.

And, he changed his shirt and got back in :)

	In this line, are there any Beltane festies that go on around around?

Total agreement from me. But for the younger of us, perhaps certain 
consensual crimes just seem ridiculous. They do to *me*... I have had to 
really  pound it into my brain, because it is just so senseless.
Being older now helps, but.....

sorry to dilute the rave banter, but does anyone here know when
free radio berkeley, free communications coalition is
having one of their micropower broadcasting workshops?

i knew they had one way back in may/june but i was out of the
country and couldn't go then.  there's nothing on their
ftp site on crl.com so this is a last ditch effort to find out.
thanks anyway for listening.  bye.

The time has come and it is my last day of work which means, my last
day of email.  So I will no longer be able to receive SFRaves much to
my sadness.  Hopefully I will figure out a way to get mail in the
future as soon as I get myself established in SF.  Now that I will be
living up there and not 100 miles away, time to start attending
events!  Anyway I have to go hopefully only for a month or so but
until I return thanks for everything!

Looks like a great weekend coming up - I'm afraid Wicked loses out to
the return of Your Sisters' House, and Thrive; for those of you new to 
the scene, Your Sisters' House is a collective of women who threw a 
great string of parties in lots of great locations last year - they
were lots of fun and lots of SFR people always showed up.  Thrive 
features many of the underground party promoters and could be great too.
Wicked is (almost) always great too, but I'll wait till the next one.
The bad news is that I'll be gone this weekend, so I'll actually miss all
of these. :(

This has me more than a little peeved.  The security dolts at the Troc
crash through the floor looking for people smoking pot, but nobody cares
at all that people are smoking cigarettes like chimneys.  And when you're
dancing and your VOmax is right up there, that's NOT the time to be
inhaling nicotine and all its nasty codependent chemicals.

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I took all the responses relating to Megatripolus and made sure that Frank and
Frazer Clark got and read ALL of them.    They were appreciative of the efforts
I made in getting this information to them.    Frazer Clark,  one of the origional
Zippy folks,  has broken away from the Angus, Pinkus group,  and is the main
driving force behind Megatripolus.    Here is what he said,  and he wanted me
to relay this to all you SFRavers.

Ventilation - Frazer has arranged to have fans around the dance floor,  and
with the owners to have the air conditioning turned on.

Free water - Still NOT free after 2 am.   But they will try and have water jugs
downstairs.

Security - Frazer has talked with the security goons,  and has worked it out
with them to be more curtious to the patrons.   However,   nothing was mentioned
about their aggresive attitude,  looking for pot smokers.

ins-and-outs - will be permitted!!

Closing time still at 6 am.

Mijos, the New Moon set up in the Presidio, in a beautiful clearing, with
the sound loud enuf to please and quiet enough to keep the nearby residents
asleep. But perhaps a few lost drivers called the attention of bored cops,
and they found us.
But the site was beautiful, you could see the ocean on your way up and hear
the waves, and in the clearing, there was beautiful sound, surrounded by
proud trees and roofed by more stars than in a Montanna sky...

After telling us to "git off OUR federal property!" and narry a voiced
"pigs" from us, they were talked into letting us get a an extra 45 minutes.

No nudity, no bongs, no scary fashion, just a cool crowd. But then it
happened, they dragged someone out for a pipe and a dime bag, shone their
lights in our faces (so we ALL stumbled around in confusion) and sent us
away.

Tweaked driving and back seat hyper heart beats is all we got from "protect
and serve." all my dangerous episodes in North America, so far, have been
at the hands of the police. Shame on them......if we do no harm to any, why
can't THEY do the same? Wouldn't be in the police, then, would they?

Come/unity was thumpathumpathumpathumpathumpathumpathumpathumpathumpathumpthump!
And a hug to all who smiled that nite!
Lotsa love, 
 Milton and the E-Bee........

The US Park Police who patrol the Presidio aren't the friendliest cops in
my experience. They had a large presence (both uniform and undercover) at
the Sunset party that was there and I'd be very careful when doing anything
not federally sanctioned on the Presidio.

Got to be careful partying on Federal land.  Any "crime" commited there is a
Federal crime and considered a felony. Also if you get busted for drugs you
are subject to extremely harsh penalties.

Just for your listening pleasure...

KZSU (90.1 FM, Stanford University) has had a house music program that has
been running for over two years.  DJ Unknown (Josh Bates) has been running
the program and has put on a number of amazing house marathons (the last
one being a 24-hour non-stop show in December)...The show ran weekly every
Tuesday from 12:00noon to 3:00PM, and was formerly called "London Jamaica".

I just wanted to inform you all that the date and time of the regular
weekly show has been CHANGED.  It will be on Sunday evening/Monday AM, from
12:00 midnight to 3:00AM.  The show will now be called "88 Acid", and the
focus for the next few months will be on acid house and deep house.  Guest
DJs, representing SF's finest, will be laying down the trax.

Remember, Sunday 12:00 Midnight to 3:00 am Monday.  Da fiercest.  So,
please give the show a listen & give Josh your support.  KZSU phone:
(415)723-9010.

Hi all!  Thanks to Bryce, Maui, Gregg, Sean, Mark, Tracy, Dante, Philip (with
one L) and all else who came out to the New Moon party Thrusday am after 
ComeUnity.  It was a blast!  (both were, that is :)

Sound was provided by Liquid Air.  A quick stealth run into SF's newest park
was done by sneaky new mooners to set up.  Those who accomplished this feat
deserve congratulations for their talents, by the way.

By the time the music came on, there were already maybe 50 or so people there.
Most came from ComeUnity and were pleasantly surprized by the cool, green,
starlit, tree-lined space.  They also seemed to like the altar, which was
laid out on satin and tye-died cloths on one side of the clearing.  

Dante started us off about 4 or 4:30 on a very mellow groove, perfect for the
surroundings and the mood.  Unfortunately, the mood became a little tense due
to the arrival of some of the more official guardians of the park, who asked
us to leave but were talked into allowing us time for Tracy to do a short
set.  One confused soul apparently misunderstood the situation and was
ticketed when an "official guardian" noticed his little bag of...well, you
know.  

I was very impressed with how calm everyone was during the breakup of the party.
People were obviously outraged with the fact that this was public land and
we weren't hurting anyone by being there.  A few people even helped out by
standing with the organizers during the negotiations, showing their support
and adding their good sense to the proceedings.

Regarding the philosophy of a party breaking up this way:  Even though it
would have been better for it to have gone on all night, I think it was 
important to make the park part of San Francisco in this way.  It belongs
to all of us now!  Vive the Presidio!

all my love,

ann

ps the organizers took care to let everyone there know it was a "renegade"
i think this analagous to a promoter at a more "legit" site making sure
there is plenty of water, bathrooms, etc. if anyone has suggestions on sites,
etc, for future events, you can email me if you like and I will pass it
along

Due to circumstances beyond our control, YSH will not be held tonight.

We are very grateful to everyone who helped us with this party -- we all 
put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this party; we are so sorry 
it wasn't rewarded as it so richly deserved....

....Uh, anyone want a whole lot of fruit and vegetables?


The MESS crew, who were so apologetic for having THRIVE on the same night :),
is where we think the YSH vibe will flow beautifully :).

Once again, we are sorry this had to happen.


But we'll be baaaaaack.....


*Love & Hugs to All*,

ARGH! I know what you mean... on the "no shit, sherlock! tip: I just read 
an article in the Chron about how "oh, gee, caffeine is addictive!" Some 
woman (who was 8 1/2 *pregnant*) apparently realized that she was at the 
market every day with two six-packs o'caffeine-laden crap, and that she 
couldn't get through the day without it. Sheesh.

What if all of us who don't like breathing addictive toxic fumes decided 
on some sort of zero-tolerance policy? Just tear the stinky butts outta 
their faces and stomped on 'em? Or maybe whole groups of folks could 
bring squirtbottles and just squirt water into their faces till the cig 
went out?

Well, we really can't, I guess, but a woman can dream, eh?  :)

see ya :)

a man wants desperately to rave, yet he has no car.  the contradictions and
anti-contradictions are rife and potent, but the man is in no mood for phil-
osophizing.  the man is in berkeley and can be reached at this account or
at 510.841.0735, or possibly if all the above fail, 510.549.2570.

thank you muchly.

p.s.  the man wants a ride to Thrive if that wasn't already obvious.

Hey--

The answering machine for Thrive's info line is kinda screwed--it gets to 
about "To get there you *click*" every time I call.  Anyone know how to 
get to Thrive?

I doubt it's really the dogs that are the problem -- most likely it's the 
owners! Dogs are fun, but they can get really excited -- and damage plants, 
animals and people.

Uh, they also don't bury their doo doo.

Okay everybody, Sunset is on for Sunday 10/9!  We are trying a different 
location because, as many of you know, the Berkeley Marina is out of the 
question.  Hopefully, with your cooperation in being stealthy and 
discrete, we can continue to spread the good vibe (and dance lots too!).

The location is available on our voice-mail number: (415)985-5264

We'll be kicking it off at 2pm and continue until about 9pm (authorities 
permitting).  Bring water, be careful with your toys, and we'll see you 
out there!!!

PS:  If you have any messages for the Sunset crew or for me (Lorien), you 
can send e-mail to helagon@well.sf.ca.us

Wow.  You have more courage than I.  Personally, I'd be terrified to have
multiton machines of death adorned with blue metal flake paint and funded
by the administrations that give us the war on drugs flying over my house.

Purple Tiger - Amused by it all and not angry at Laura

ps Personally, I have a soft spot for loud and large machines, but not
when they are funded by the government.

Well, my father and brother are both in the Navy, and the Navy
fed me, clothed me, and sheltered me for 21 years while I was
growing up, so I have s soft spot in my heart for those multi-ton
machines of death adored with blue metal flake paint and funded
by the administrations that give us the war on drugs.

I also like submarines, too, and have ridden in one while it was
cruising out in the Atlantic.  And yes it was fueled by nuclear fuel
that will some day be the death of us all.  It was fun, I heard
whales and got to look through the periscope.

I'm not about to bite the hand that fed me, I'm very proud of my
father and brother.

Happily Un-PC in the capital of PC-ness,

Laura

i just watched several of them soar and dance through the sky over san  
francisco a little while ago.  setting aside for a moment how they came to be,  
their intended purpose, their fuel consumption, etc., i was filled with awe at  
their grace.  what a wonderful achievement it is that humans have built and  
can operate machines like that.

Date: Sun, 09 Oct 1994 14:52:45 -0700
From: Greg Earle <earle@isolar.Tujunga.CA.US>

Yesterday (Saturday) we decided to buy a San Fernando Valley Recycler to look
for something else, and last night Jennifer sat down to scan the Musical
Accessories category.

All of a sudden she went "Wha ... what the Hell?!?!".  She'd seen this ad:

	ROLAND TB-303 bass synthesizer/controller,
	$100; Fender Strat neck, $150 or trade for Tele neck

(Yes, that really *does* say "$100")

I said "Dude, that thing's GONE, I bet it was gone first thing on Thursday
morning!".

She couldn't resist calling anyway, just to find out when it went.  She got off
the phone nearly peeing her pants with laughter.

Turned out that it was an older Jazzman who was really into guitars, and he had
this thing lying around.  "I just thought it was an ugly piece of junk", he
said.  "Made all these dumb little bass sounds!" :-) :-) :-)

The Recycler comes out at the crack of dawn on Thursday mornings.

The calls started coming in at 7:00 AM.  :-)

After a while, he left the answering machine to answer them.  And still they
came in.  Every 10 minutes, on average.

Some of them were classic:

(An English guy; insert appropriate accent) "I will top any bid.  Any."

Others were like: (Jazzman) "Hello?"  "Do you have it?"

Or: (Jazzman) "Hello?"  "Hey!  Who'd you sell it to?!?  Dennis?  Yo-yo?  Ike?"

And: "I've got the cash.  Right now." (Lots of these obvious "I'll buy it and
resell it for mega-profits" types, he said.  He filtered all of those out from
the answering machine messages.)

After the first hundred (yup) or so calls, he realized that selling it for a
mere $100 was not his smartest possible move, so he opened it up for bids.  He
eventually sold it for $350.  When asked how many total calls he'd gotten, he
said "Oh, man.  Hundreds.  Hundreds."

He finally chose some kid who sounded sincere and who begged him for it because
he "needed it for [his] show".  The kid showed up at his house - in full-on
Techno garb, natch - and when the guy brought it out and showed it to him, "the
kid started jumping up and down and making funny squealing noises" - "This is
it!!  It's it!  It *is* it!".

Anyway, this was too funny not to share it with y'all :-)

	- Greg

Thanx to everyone who came out to Pure Lov & Sol this week.  It 
was a really great party.  I'd like to extend thanks to 
everyone who is helping this party get going.  I'd like 
everyone to come out and check it out next week (even though 
I'll be in Las Vegas).  If anyone knows of any info lines in 
Vegas they can give me, or some parties going on this coming 
weekend, PLEASE let me know.  My girlfriend lives there, and 
I'd like to go party there with her...  Thanx.

Hello Folks!

 I tried to post two choices for a restaurant for the last South Bay Lunch
for 1994 - I tried last night , but the posting didn't make it to SFRaves.
That's just as well , because I changed my mind!

 Somene has recommended a Vietnamese restaurant in Mountain View called
Kim's , on Castro Ave. They also have Chinese dishes , and options for
vegitarians. I haven't eaten there , but it sounds good to me. 

 When I have more information about the restaurant's location , I'll
post directions on how to get there from the highways and El Camino. The
time to meet there will be 11:30 AM , unless there's a lot of objections
to that time.

 Please let me know if you can make it! I'll make reservations for the 
amount of folks who reply .

	Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

I can't *believe* that the Thrive people decided to have a party at an
East Bay Regional Park. 

I guess our previous lessons with $270.00 tickets and lawyers wan't enough
for them.

In the past, the Troc always supplied free water by having a water fountain
(which is probably nice for the bartenders cuz they don't have to serve water
all night).  The water fountain was (probably still is) right between the
men's and women's bathrooms.

Unfortunately, the Troc recently installed a photo booth machine right in front
of the water fountain.  A friend of mine hypothesized that the reason they
chose to put the photo macine in front of the water fountain was because
perhaps the machine needed a water supply in order to develop the film.
If that's the case, why don't they just put the machine near the bar and hook
it up to a water suppky there?

                      How was Sunset after sunset?
So how did the new location work out? We were there for about an hour, but had
to leave due to prior plans with some of our city-dwelling friends. We saw the
cops come and go, but just as we were leaving the parking lot, a park ranger
jeep went charging up the road. Any trouble? We really liked the location (we
didn't make it to any of the Marina Sunsets, so we couldn't really compare), and
the people and music were great! If it goes on this weekend, we'll come earilier
and stay later.

I am fortunately enough to be able to see the action from my living room and I  
must say it was a wonderful experience. Before saturday I never paid much  
attention to the blue angels and as I watched the planes flew by shaking my  
windows with the incredible sonic boom, I sort of felt glad that my tax dollar  
went into it. I was fully aware that there were apparently better places to  
spend the tax dollar but still, as I was commenting with my neighbors, one does  
leave the experience with a sense of awe and a renewed belief in this nation.

i just watched several of them soar and dance through the sky over san  

francisco a little while ago.  setting aside for a moment how they came to be,  

their intended purpose, their fuel consumption, etc., i was filled with awe at  

their grace.  what a wonderful achievement it is that humans have built and  

can operate machines like that.

                      Terence McKenna in SFExam/Chron
Any of you happen to catch the Terence McKenna cover-story interview in the SF
Examiner/Chronicle magazine this Sunday? First time I really read/heard his
ideas sans third-party interpretation. Seemed like the reporter was steering him
pretty hard through. Does he really feel that Psylocybin mushrooms are the
one-stop panacea for all of lifekind's ills, or is there more to his story? The
Apocalyptic warnings kinda turned me off, but it was definitely more thought
provoking than Hussien's latest adventures. He mentioned speaking/lecturing at raves.
Any events in this area?

     Amen! Every dollar spent on the Blue Angels is a dollar NOT spent on 
     the war on drugs! What better reason to enjoy an airshow!

Well, I can't help but be impressed (and entertained) by such a powerful
example of high technology.  But the mentality that thinks that
our armed forces are cool and our country is cool because of such
displays of power is similar to the mentality that thinks a strong-arm 
police force is cool and our oppressive legal system is cool because
it can so easily prosecute people for doing drugs and attending  
non-permitted parties.

It's easy to admire power when it doesn't seem to be oppressing you
directly, but in my opinion, the power worship mentality is like
bowing to an authority figure just because it has authority over you.
Blind loyalty to strong things is one of the basic things about human
nature that make this world so fucked up.  

But yeah, I was entertained by the war planes.  Maybe next year the
navy will detonate a (small) atomic bomb on Angel Island to impress us.
That would *really* be cool.

I thought sunset was pretty amazing... It was located in the presidio, and
driving out to the spot, i was much amazed by the view...i liked the
location too... 

we got there around 4:00, an dmusic was just starting.  someone told me
that before that they had generator problems, but after 4, the music
didn't stop (except when the police came) until sunset.  the police came 3
times, first was the ranger police who said that they needed permits and
that no alcohol was allowed, but after the looked around a bit, they let
sunset keep going until sunset, when they had to shut it down, i thought
they were very nice about it.  then the military police came, but i don't
think they did anything except just look around.  finally at sunset, the
ranger police came back and shut it down, a little early due to noise
complaints...which i can understand because there were houses on the other
side of the hill... 

i thought the vibe was really incredible and i talked too and met many new
people... 

i had a very nice time...

the tb303 has two componenents:

a synthesizer
a sequencer

anyone who knows how to synthesize can either exactly emulate or make
a superior sound to the tb303

anyone who knows how to sequence can do the same.

anyone who doesn't believe me is welcome to come to the Blue Cube Studios
and watch me demonstrate the TRUTH of this.

people love the tb303 because they don't *have* to learn to sequence or
synthesize.

sorta like how people use violin samples instead of learning to play the
violin

Weekend Rave report
-------------------

   This weekend had Wicked @ DV8,  Thrive (Which got busted twice - Shame on
you folks for even *considering* that Caldecott location),  and YSH which
was cancelled.   DARN!!   I was looking forward to that one.    Because I
volunteered to help set up an Internet Connection at Megatripolus,   I had
to at least be there between 8pm and Midnight.   Then was planning to head
over to YSH,  until I found it was cancelled.

   This 2nd installation of Megatripolus was far less crowded,  primary
reason being the $10 cover charge.    As they opened up,   things started 
very slow,   but started picking up later.    With the night being unusually
warm,   I had expected it to be hot and humid,  but the Troc must have
turned on the air conditioner.    Although the fans weren't present,  
I managed to stay cool.     

   Leaving and coming back now presented no problem,  and the security
"glitches" seemed to have been worked out.    The "Annex" across the
street offered free coffey with a box for donations.   Had plently of
cushions and pillows to flop down on,   and the ambience provided 
total and complete isolation from the dancing area.   It was a short
(And welcome) walk across the street,   at whats being called the
Annex..

   The music started out with deep funkey house,   and trance.   Then
started to gradually pick up,  until it was time for the speaker.

   If you go to Megatripolus with the expectation of non-stop dancing,
you might be dissapointed,    but these half hour breaks in the dancing
give time for interesting lecturers.    Not long,  the music started up
again.  None of these interruptions to the dancing lasted much more than
about a half hour,   and if one knows this in advance,  can at least 
plan their shill times to coencide with the breaks,  so it isn't all
that bad....

   About 2 am or so,  Jeremy got behind the turntables,  and put out the
most "Twisted" Jungle and hard core set I have heard since "Industrial
Strength" last year.   Yowsa!  didn't think my body could move that
fast....   1 1/2 hours of sustained hard-core can really get the blood
flowing....   Yummy!!.... Naturally,  a lot of California weenies were
wimping out,  and not dancing,  and complaining about the speed.   We
don't get much of this here in San Francisco!!!   Not all folks like
it here...

   Later on,  things slowed down again (rather abruptly),  clearly
indicating another DJ was spinning.   I took the opportunity to catch
the end of the lecture from the dude that founded "Burning man".
Unfortunately,   his lecture and presentation was at the same time
as the twisted hard-core set,   and I NEVER miss an opportunity 
to dance to it.

   This 2nd Magatripolus was different from the first,  as a whole
new set of DJ's presented their stuff.    Names I've never heard 
except was surprised that Jeremy was spinning.    I met him several
times at Sunset,   talked a lot while chilling.   I definitely will
recommend that Frazer put him on again.    I think that if they keep
having new DJ's each time,  and have the variaty of music they have had
in the last two editions,   I think that it has the potentuality to
draw a lot of people.   They have listened intentely to my sugesstions
and have read the SFRaves reports and critics,  and at least know what
the issues are.   Thats more than what I can say about a lot of 
promoters out there.

   The Internet computer was plagued by phone line problems.   Apparently,
the connection would get cut,   but later on,  it was worked out.    Thanx
go out to Ried for providing the Mac portable and figuring out the
modem problem.

   This next weekend,  the Russian River Amoeba party... Oh Yum!!
this is supposed to be good...  Gotta dust off the sleeping bag
from "Burning man!"  - Yukk!!

And now.... SUNSET IS BACK!!   Yay!!  And thanx go out to the authorities
(somewhat confused on what to do) to allow us to have it on the Presidio.

It was really incredable,  this site...  A huge grove of euculipsic trees,
with a spectacular view of the ocean abd the sunset.   We would get
visited often by many kinds of police.    Park rangers,   Military police,
etc.    All which caused the music to be turned down,  with the exception
of one time,  while the Sunset people were negotiating with the cops for
a chance to allow us to continue.   One time,  the Military police came
over and bitched because someone parked next to a fence,  alegedly to
keep people out of a munitions dump.   It was clearly indicated that NO
ALCOHOL and drugs were allowed,   and we would have to leave by exactly
sunset.   We had two hours (WOW!),  danced like there was no tommorrow,
and stopped only to chill out.    Weather was perfect in all respects.
No wind,   balmey....   Couldn't be better.

When the sun funally set,   sure enough,   up came the cops to make sure
we stopped on time.    The DJ was allowed to finish the song,   and held
up the next record in a jesture to indicate LAST SONG... I stepped up
my intensity...    until the fadeout....   Everyone cheered....   Very
good conclusion....

More next week...

Well, yah, but having the original is soooooooooo much cooler!  If you're live,
which one would you rather show off with?  The tb303, or some hi-tech wonder? 
I mean, I agree that almost any of those sounds can be almost duplicated, but
that's not why the tb303 is so desired.  And furthermore, I don't know about
the 303 really, but if it's an analog sound, you can never completely duplicate
it with something digital.  There's *no way* you can with today's tech.

Exactly emulate?  Not really.  Different synths sound different 
because they are constructed of different components.  I'm sure *someone* 
at Nova knows how to "synthesize", but the BassStation still doesn't 
"exactly emulate" the 303.  Superior sound?  Sure, but it also depends on 
the setting and mood.  A sound is worthless if it doesn't fit anywhere.

> anyone who knows how to sequence can do the same.

Again, not really.  Part of the 303's sound is it's portamento (or slide) 
function.  This is not implemented in all sequencers (hardware or 
software), and not all synths which have portamento onboard transmit 
sysex for this function.

I think I'd rather go just to see it.  And to see WBL play, as well.

I like the sound.  Is that so wrong?

not really, as discussed on the analog list, both the synthesis
and the sequencer on the 303 are unique to that instrument.  the filter
and the way it interacts with the accent and the sequencer are different,
jon d can expound at length on the sequencer, and the 303 filter
was described by mr 808:

which basically means that you can't exactly duplicate a 303 with just
any analog synth, though you can come close in certain cases.

Wicked@DV8 - looks like a club, certainly felt like a club, fortunately
didn't sound like a club.  I'm not complaining, it was what I expected and I
had fun.  Music was up to Wicked's always high quality and that new system
can be LOUD though fortunately it wasn't all night.  I thought Jeno spun a
particularuly killer set.  Not *that* different than his usual skillful self
and I knew a lot of the tracks but it was just SLAMMIN and so *ON*.  It
provided a nice contrast to Sunset which was great as always too.  I can't
help think that the powers that be would have been happier and perhaps kinder
in the future if we had all driven away a little bit more quickly and
coherently.  Of course the reason I know this is that I was guilty of
lingering for quite a while myself.  We really are lucky to have a wide
variety of consistently good parties to choose from.  From the Blue Angels
dive bombing the Golden Gate as I drove across it to relaxing on the beach
for awhile after Sunset(though the sun was still setting) I had one of those
"I'm *SO* glad I live in S.F. I can't begin to express it" feelings and it
wasn't even an out-of-the-ordinary weekend.

love y'all and this city,
phuture

Here's the directions to Kim's Restaurant , the site of this Wednesday's
South Bay Lunch at 11:30 AM:

 The restaurant is in the city of Mountain View , at 368 Castro Street ,
between California Ave. and Dana St. , near the intersection of Castro
and California. There is parking behind the restaurant.

 From the North , on HW 101: Drive past Palo Alto , past the HW 85 exit.
  Take the Moffett Blvd. exit , driving towards the west. After Middlefield
  Road , don't be in the right hand lane , as it turns off Castro after
  the train tracks. If you can't find parking on Castro , make a right turn
  at California , and park behind the restaurant.

 From the South , on HW 101: Drive past Sunnyvale , past the Ellis Street
  exit and the Moffett Field exits and take the Moffett Blvd. exit. 
  Drive west , and follow the same directions as above.

 From El Camino Real: Drive to Castro Street , turn onto Castro Street
  towards the bay. You could turn left at California and right onto
  Bryant to get to the parking lot , or you can try Castro Street 
  for parking. 

 See you there!
			Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com
 PS - I have a sample menu form this restaurant - they seem to be proud
  of their vegitarian dishes. And they also have a wide selection of
  omnivore dishes as well.

FYI folks!
Yesterday afternoon there was a massive (40.000) protest march and rally
against the legislation of the Criminal Justice Bill which is scheduled to go 
through in the next few weeks. This Bill will make it illegal for gatherings 
of over 10 people on public land, and will allow squatters to be evicted within
24 hours, both serious threats to civil liberties in the UK. As well, the right
to silence will be removed -- obscene in a Bill created originally to reduce
wrongful convictions.
So the thousands of people marched through the streets of London, accompanied
by the sound systems which promote and support the rave culture in Britain. 
At around 5pm, when everyone was raving away in Hyde Park, the police started
rushing the park on horseback, trying to shut down the rave, whose permit was
to end at 4:30. My feeling is that if the police had laid low, the rave would
have continued til people got hungry and the pubs opened and folks owuld
have left. But rave music is political here, symbolic in the same way that 
punk once was. The police were determined to shut it down. 

But things did not go as planned. When the police charged, the crowds of 4-5000
moved towards them and after hailing bottles and sticks at them, the mounted
police moved outside the gates. Along the gates were hundreds of cops in riot
gear. Repeatedly they charged the fence, behind which massed hundreds of masked
protesters. While missiles were few, folks went on forays into the city and
returned bearing paving stones and sticks. When the police charged and tried
to batter across the fence, there was a strong hail of bags of sand, bottles and
sticks, so they quickly withdrew. 

Still, the mood was festive, a bicycle powered sound system repeatedly circled
and fire eaters and jugglers performed, poets ranted through megaphones
and the crowd danced to hardcore techno. When space was reclaimed, it just
became part of the dance floor, making the cops assaults increasingly ludicrious
At around 10 pm, Word circulated that all the gates had closed and we were all
hungry tired and it felt like a good time to leave. Yet, when we headed for the 
exits, all the streets were lined with cops in riot gear and the Underground/
Metro was closed. Quickly, people broke through the lines across Oxford St.
and suddenly store windows were shattering and everyone was running -- fast.
53 Shops had their windows smashed including the Boots and McDonalds, both
companies under boycott. When Tottenham Court Road Station was reached, many
broke through the lines and entered the transport to go home.

The BBC reported that police are looking for a group of anarchist organizers
for the riot. Personally I think that it was largely spontaneous, a situation
created by the cops, with a crowd sick and tired of being harassed; this week
the longstanding road protest in Leytonstone, London will probably end after
a slow destruction of homes and communities. 

The cracks in the system are increasingly evident, and the political is
becoming redefined.

<rambling commentary follows -- beware>

like many, I have mixed feelings about the blue angels and the military.

the thing i like about the military and the military industrial complex
is that it is a wonderful make-work program. socialism without any of
those democracy-good-communism-bad dumbfucks actually knowing/admitting
that it is socialism. (The fact that the irony of all this is lost on
these people is ironic, ain't it?)

the thing that I don't like about it is that all this high-tech work is
in the hands of private corporations, rather than the government
itself. most of what ills this country is privatization of this work.
costs would be significantly reduced if we got rid of the middle-man
(industrialists, multiple levels of subcontractors each skimming some
$$$ and passing the crumbs on to labor) and put the government in
charge of everything -- no more bidding games (the company w/ the
lowest bid and the biggest payoffs to congress wins, then they jack the
govt for big $$$ as they slowly unveil that their bidding and proposal
process was complete fiction.).

all this bullshit about "competition being healthy" is just that --
bullshit. Competition inspires cheating, fraud and brings out the worst
in mankind -- war instincts. Competition, privatization and all that
crap just breeds waste,  duplicated effort, a majority of losers, and a
minority of winners. In a system where competitiveness means 10% are
deemed winners and 90% are losers means that we create a lot of losers.
It is no wonder we keep on having recessions because ours is a system
that devours itself. Beyond that, we're wasting effort and most
importantly resources on a system where competition and its inherent
wastefulness is considered good. The earth is too small and limited for
us to be wasting resources -- the "product" of the other 90%, the
losers, is wasted energy, wasted time, wasted material. WIth the
earth's limited resources, this is clearly folly. (Is it any wonder
that things are completely fucked up when we're indoctrinated at such
an early age that competition is good?)

the other thing i like about space program, and military technology is
that they have really forced a strong boost in technology itself. I'm
all too familiar with private industry's ability to do research on it's
own -- it's completely pathetic, and no real innovation has  ever been
the result of industrial, product-oriented research (everything that we
consider innovation, from computer technology to medicine has come from
govt. funded research which private industry steals, repackages,
markets, and sells).

our system is such that corporate R&D is at best 1 or 2 years "out",
mostly because the stock market rewards companies that slash their
research work force, and also because most US corporate pinheads are
focused on quick returns on investments, rather than long-term risky
projects (long-term risky projects don't make for good resume foddder
when you're jostling for position to rise up a corporate ladder). Fact
is, the only innovation in the US happens in the university labs and
think-tanks funded by ARPA, NSF, NRL, etc. Because risk and long-term
rewards are expected there, but shunned in industry.

As an example, before the space and satellite program forced dense
electronic integration, the corporate response to various proposed
integrated circuit technologies was "how are we going to be able to
service and replace parts in integrated circuits when they're so tiny?"
They couldn't project out to a day when an integrated circuit
containing hundreds of thousands of components would be so cheap to
manufacture that you would just replace the whole thing, rather than
servicing it. Major advances in manufacturing technology, from the
microscopic to the macroscopic, have enabled us to create things that
the corporate pinheads would have vetoed as impossible to create,
impossible to market to everyman. And yet they exist, no thanks to
the corporate profit-oriented cover-yer-ass easier-to-say-no-than-yes folk.

If it weren't for nearly unlimited govt. $$$ to make technological
develkopment possible, we'd probably still be using discrete circuitry
and none of the things that we take for granted in our modern life --
ubiquitous computers, audio, internet, telephony etc -- would exist. Of
course, once something has been proved possible, industry will  be
happy to take a guaranteed thing and refine it to death.... BUt they
won't ever take the first step.
 
It's the old hippie in us that hates technology, but the raver in us
loves it.  a balanced view would indicate things like the space program
and high-budget military R&D have made what we're doing possible -- our
music, our beloved synths, amplifiers, digital recording studios; our
communications, bulletin boards and computers made possible by
far-sighted ARPA funding of universities and research labs.

you might view all this as an incredible waste of money, but you forget
that many of you are living off the profits of our huge investments in
military and space technology. I've heard the figures of this ROI
(return on investment) from our tax dollars being in the 1000% region,
though unfortunately, we've set up a system where the returns are
trickling up, rather than down.

if anything, the problem is that we didn't socialize  the system
enough, that we didn't spend enough tax dollars to make this
military-industrial-science-technology make-work program reach 100%
employment. In other words, it should  have also helped people in the
ghetto. If you think about it, it used to -- 20-50 years ago parts of
SF and Oakland that are now slums used to be blue collar working class
neighborhoods fueled by the moneys of naval shipyards. Now we've
got Hunters Point and West Oakland, to say nothing of the "california
recession".

I'd like to see national make-work programs continue, but perhaps on
some goal that we can all work for, and a goal that doesn't dominate
other peoples via  sabre rattling and war machines.  WHere? How? It's
up in the sky -- the space program, paid for by heavy heavy taxes on
the rich. Don't even make it worthwhile to get rich in private
industry, and give big breaks to those that are willing to work for
lower wages on this national goal, as well as support for this goal,
e.g. education, health-care, etc. In short, take the practices of the
reagan-bush era and invert them.

I for one would be happy to pay much more taxes (as long as everybody
else is also being taxed equally) in order to create a system of
universal employment, universal education, universal health care, with
a grand overall goal of colonizing space.

Too bad that this will never happen in the US -- we're too busy 
poisoning our dreams with "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" and all
those superficial fashion-wanks we see on TV.

P.S.  I certainly would condemn anyone throwing things at the police,
      but it is understandable how things have come to that point.

Haven't looked inside a 303 specifically, but having looked inside other Roland
gear, my guess would be that it's made up almost entirely of proprietary chips
(stuff you can't get at Radio Shack, but only from Roland's Japanese OEM manufacturers).
Next best step many others have already taken is to borrow their friend's 303
and sample each sound, then sell the samples at those VERY cheap rates. You can
find a slew of small shops doing this in the Transoniq Hacker, for instance.

I got there late and only caught the last half hour or so of music.
Sigh. But I liked the new location, a eucalyptus grove in the
Presidio, it felt more like a picnic than a show. (Not that I didn't
like the marina). I did finally get to meet some other sfravers,
Milton (and the E-Bee), Phuture, and Lee Fogel, nice to meet you guys.

When they had to shut down someone (Galen?) announced that next
weekend they would be up at the Russian River and that after that
there would be two more Sunsets.

Niels, I couldn't agree with you more on the above paragraph.  In
addition to, or perhaps instead of working for lower wages, a shorter
work week would also help us reach full employment while leaving people
with more liesure time to explore cheaper forms of entertainment like
spending time with family/friends, and, uh, attending and putting on 
raves. d;-)
 
>[...] a grand overall goal of colonizing space.

One element of raving is that, for many of us, it is a transcendental
experience.  We transcend the need to sleep, the need to cling to our
egos and insecurities, the need to stay rooted a "normal" state of 
consciousness, while dancing to music and beats that cannot be physically 
played by humans.  To me, using technology to further dominate and 
control this planet is a rather shortsighted goal compared to attaining 
the freedom to get beyond it.

Not that I mean to trivialize the need for a stable foundation from which
to launch ourselves - but the amount of expense people and nations
put aside in order to nurture their distrust of each other is 
overwhelming when compared to what humans expend in order to explore new 
horizons.  I'm not sure whether it is an innate part of human nature to be 
so insecure and doubtful, or whether we all have been brainwhashed by 
the powermongers to be that way.  One thing I like about raving is that
not only does it defy the status quo authoritarian structure of things,
but it usually attempts to do so in a positive way.  I.e. raving is an
extension of our culture, not the destruction or suppression of it.

I know that I'm like way in the dark ages compared to all of 
you and most of my friends, but what is a rave ? The last time 
I heard about it, its just a party with people taking drugs and 
having sex on the dance floor. I know that theres more to it, 
so what's up ? I live in the bay area. Are there any coming up. 
Specifically in San Jose ?? I'm only 23, so I can adapt.

I may sound like a geek, but I'm not. I was just too involved 
in hip-hop to pay any attention to Techno. I'm getting bored 
with rap. Time to check out something else.

Yeah, I'm totally down with LKJ. 
BTW do you have the LKJ dub 12" of sonny's letter?


Back in '84 I think it was, I was over in England when they were having
riots in Brixton and another part of London.  It was sparked off by 
three seperate incidents involving the police breaking into people's homes
brandishing and using firearms (they obviously had been watching too many
Dirty Harry movies).  In one instance, they came in, told eveyone to freeze.
They saw movement under the covers of a bed and shot and killed a 5 year old
boy.  The grandmother in the house had a heart attack and died right there.
They refused to call an ambulance for her until well over 20 minutes had
passed.  The person that they had come to arrests (supposedly for traffic 
violations, although it was believed he was a big time dealer of "drugs") 
was not on the premises, later when he was arrested, they had to 
release him because  they had nothing on him.  This set off several 
days of intense but relatively organized rioting centered around several 
housing complexes.  The interesting thing to me was that it WAS NOT 
just young black kids rioting and fighting the police but young whites as well.
Some of the insurgents were interviewed on television and they were
very clear why they were doing this.  They were tired of being
mistreated by the police and the recent shootings were the last straw.
Of course British Society be the condenscending racist society that it
is, (much like the good ol' US of A) could not see these young whites
as being in solidarity with their black counterparts but chalked their
participation up to "communist ringleaders" (obviously if a riot
exhibits some organized tendencies, it MUST be because white folks are
in charge ;)

Anyway, this latest incident just goes to show you what can happen if people
are pushed too much.  Fortuntely for the British, the police are not normally
equipped with guns.  If this had happened here, it would have been Kent State
all over again.

There are clones:
Will Systems MB303
Novation Bass Station
Control Systems Deep Bass Nine

They're so pricy that you could but a real 303 even at the super-inflated
prices but they do have MIDI.  The original list price on a Roland TB303 was
$400 (I think) so for a collector's item the prices aren't that high.  I've
got addresses for those companies somewhere if anyone wants.

Several people have told me that's what they thought raves were about.
We really need some outside-the-scene PR work if that's the average
impression of what we're doing...

Reminds me of one beautiful day at the Palace of Fine Arts when I was
entertaining myself (and many others) by making giant bubbles and
watching them float across the lake. A few would land in the lake,
causing great confusion for nearby ducks :).

After a while, a little girl about 6 years detached herself from the
crowd, walked up to me with a serious expression, and said "You're

Well, there's no way to do it *affordably* wth today's tech, but it could be
done.  There are CPUs out there that can do a billion operations per second.
(I know DEC makes one.  Intel and Motorola probably do too.)  If I model each
analog component using one of these (i.e. one CPU would be a dedicated sine
wave generator, another CPU would be a dedicated filter), there is absolutely
no way you could distinguish the difference between an analog system and the
equivalent digital one.  You could *easily* model a 303 digitally.  But you
might have to take out a mortgage to do it.

Things I have learned from the Park Patrol and other places:

Some of the Park Patrol are extreme hotheads. As in "Get out of the
car and stand against the fence."

Some are not, and while they see the parties as essentially harmless,
they want to set a precedent that they _will_ shut them down. They are
afraid of a free-for-all now that it is a public park.

There are a lot of patrols in the park. The park is utterly dead quiet
late at night. The only traffic will be your party and the park
patrol.

There are undercover police who work the park. They are there
specifically to find drugs.

The park patrol really really hates to see alcohol.

The Presidio is federal property, and crimes there can be prosecuted
under federal statutes. In particular, penalties for crimes related to
scheduled substances are substantially harsher than California
statutes.

The Presidio is a very large very beautiful and very tempting place to
throw a renegade. If you are thinking about it, take heed of the above
and plan accordingly. I personally would not do a party there, as
there are just too many patrols, and traffic to/from the site is very
conspicuous. A renegade might succeed if partygoers parked in a
residential neighborhood and walked to the site.

It should be possible to obtain permits for parties there. A daytime
event there would be wonderful. Let's barbeque :).

Actually, the other day there was this guy in the stall next to me
who amazed me with his ability to mimic many of the sounds of a 303...

I never said this would be a smart way to do things.  The original poster

I'm not talking about sampling at all.  I'm talking about creating a digital
model of an analog system.  The model could emulate the noise as well.
And at 1 billion operations for second, which is an incredible amount of
overkill for this type of problem, there should be *no* noticeable digital 
errors.  (I'm not saying you would *have* to use such a powerful CPU.  I was
saying that the problem *could* be solved using one.)

True, but DSP is the technology that digital synths use, and it's incredibly
lame at producing analog sounds.  I'm talking about modelling the actual 
analog circuitry, which is a completely different problem altogether.  There
are digital synths out now (the VL1) that use incredible amounts of processing
to emulate acoustic instruments through physical modelling.  I was posing a
similar solution of modelling a 303 in the same way.  Actually, I wonder if
the VL1's architecture could be used to emulate the 303.  Hmmm...

ummm.....

   it's not possible for a given synth to EXACTLY duplicate another;
     each synth (especially analog ones) has it's own special tone
       color, which is determined by each and every component inside
         the box.  
   i've got an oberheim OB1, and a Juno 106.  there's NO WAY i can
     get the juno to sound exactly like the OB1, because they are from
       different eras, and have radically different circuits.

   this difference is even more exaggerated when one considers the
     newer synths, with all the various sort of linear, subtractive,
       additive, morphing, and what-have-you types of synthesis...

   so you mite be able to get a sound SIMILAR to yer TB303, but you'll
     never duplicate it, unless you chop the original apart and rebuild
      a clone piece-by-piece.

   don't forget there's a big difference between an analog sequencer
     and a digital one, too....

The following letter appeared in _Processed_World_ Number 31.  I quote
without permission, but the magazine appears to be un-copyrighted. Any
misquotations or mis-spellings are entirely my own fault. I reproduce this
in this forum, because this appears to be the beginnings of a methodology
of transformation that may be applicable in our scene and in our lives. The
letter is quoted verbatim.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We all know that the existing institutions are rotten.  Capitalism,
white supremacy, patriarchy, the state--you name it.  But what alternatives
have we proposed? Not many.

"I think this is a big problem.  It means that activists are struggling day
to day with only vague ideas about the kind of society we're fighting for,
or how to bring it about.  It means it's easy for us to re-create, in our own 
organizations, the very evils we're fighting against.  It also means we have
a hard time convincing other folks to join us.  If major social change is
going to happen, we'll need some fairly specific ideas about what to change
to, expressed in a way that lots of non-activists can relate to.  But proposing
alternative institutions is hard to do-- much harder than criticizing what
exists now.  How do we do it?

"There are people who suspect the very idea of envisioning something better.
I mean proposals about the kind of society we want to live in, the kind of
society that's worth struggling for. (Actually, 'vision' may not be the right
word, because it has connotations of something mystical and impractical.)

"It's about ~proposing~ ideas, not ~imposing~ them.  It's about ideas emerging
from a process of democratic dialogue.  And that is exactly the spirit in
which I am proposing these ideas on how to think about vision.  In no way do
I think I've got it all figured out.  THIS IS NOT A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS THAT
I WANT YOU TO FOLLOW.  Let's start a dialogue on how we can all get better
at thinking about vision.  Examine and criticize these ideas and then propose
your own.  Nor is it about predicting the future.  It's about naming and
communicating your desires, changing that part of the future that's within your
control and preparing to cope with that part that's out of your control.  It's
not about producing a fixed blueprint, or a plan. It's about an ongoing
planning ~process~.  The plans that come out are only for the purposes of
documenting where the process stands at a particular moment.  The process is
about changing the actions you take now, and about the human development of
everybody involved.

"Finally, it's not about pointless fantasizing, disconnected from action.  It's
about expressing the ideals that guide action.  I would argue that ~any~ action
towards social change is guided by some ideals of a better society.  Most of 
the time, these ideals are not stated, so they can't be examined and debated.
I think it's very useful to make these ideals explicit.  We should specify
present desires, not predict future outcomes.

"You don't have to say how this desired future would come about, or even argue
that it is possible to bring it about.  There is no requirement that it be
implementable.  Assume magic.  This will help you get clear about what you
really want.  One of the biggest obstacles to creativity is letting implemen-
tation issues constrain your desires and you imagination.

"You ~do~ have to explain how it would work, and how it would maintain itself
if it did exist.  No magic here.  It has to be technologically, ecologically,
and humanly ~feasible~ (for example, it can't require saints, but you can allow
for people's potential to be better than they are today). It has to be capable
of sustaining itself over time.  It has to be specific enough to be reasonably
argued with.  It must be quickly and easily ~adaptable~ (this helps avoid the
fixed blueprint problem).  Finally, it should be ~inspiring~ because if you're
not excited about it, then something went wrong.

"Here is a set of steps for getting started:
* Define the issue you're working on
* Define your criteria
* Define the components of what you're designing
* Identify the existing alternatives
* Evaluate the existing alternatives against the criteria
* Design new alternatives which would meet the criteria better
* Think about how your design relates to other areas
* Get comments from people, incorporate new ideas

"The opposition in this county is suffering from a vast failure of the imagi-
nation.  We know what we're against, but we're not nearly so clear about what
we're for.  It's time for us to figure it out -- all of us, not just a few
brilliant individuals.  Of course, developing a new vision of a better society
will not guarantee the changes we want.  But I am convinced these changes 
cannot and will not happen without such a vision."

The letter is signed "D.S., San Francisco"

Mijos, i persisted, and I found!
 Jes, it was hard, it relocated and then went to oakland and then got
busted. The party was pumpin', people were dancing and yelling and
cheering, but the cops shut it down. It was between the water and some
empty hangars, who could hear it?

Anyway, 24th and ill, same old thing. Restarting at 4 am, it just is hard
for the vibe to return when you've been in a car 2 hours sitting and
talking. The music was sweet, but again, few people left to dance. Really a
shame, because thrive was a serious party, pre-bust. 

Better luck next time, my loves, it will happen! I'll be there anytime,
over wicked, just to see those smiles!

Lotsa love,

Mijos, if you have a party, it's simple. Get two stocky guys with
crew-cuts, giv'em a uniform, and a fake squad car (but with decent lights).
as the cops show up, we intercept their call, tell them "adam 5" is there
already there, and they will pull out and leave when they see our "cops"
walking around.
Now that's my definition of undercover cop!Yeah! Let's infiltrate them!

or, get two tall guys in suits and patent leather shoes (those that sound
like horses in the movies) and walkie talkies/dark glasses. When the cops
show up, tell them :"FBI, officer. We're conducting oru own investigation,
here, you better leave now. We'll take care of this...."

  Oh well, you gotta dream. 
but you know, the park rangers at presidio did not really complain, they
just didn't know what to do in this transition period, but were very cool
and calm, and they liked the total absence of alcahol and drugs, looked at
our clothes, and smiled:"I like this crowd. You do this a lot?" And added
that maybe Galen could get a permit for a few hours of night, if there were
no fires.
 Now that's gettin along! No negativity from us, and they didn't yell "move
it or get a ticket" like at some other places. I think they like our
activities, as long as there is no heavy traffic, fires, litter or drugs.
It is a public park, after all, not our portable amsterdam.

  Just wonder if we should be pumping heavy bass into the ground right next
to the the buried magazine! yuk!

people- if that TB303 sounds just as fat on CD as it does anywhere
else (and it *does*) then a computer can generate 303 sounds because:

data on a CD is binary.

i love that line about "dsp is what todays synths use and therefore is
thin".  so wrong. such ignorance. todays synths sound like they do because
they are programmed that way. and 99% of them don't even synthesize, they
are merely sample players with lame samples in them.

-------------------------
I knew it was just a matter of time before the acoustic puritans spoke up on
this! :) Sound design is one of the few places I believe the Maciavellian "the
end justifies the means" really applies. I really don't care if you use 100 oscillators
or 100 kHz sample rate, or if you bang on a trashcan lid (or even if you use a
TB303!), as long as it sounds interesting. The "I created this with a circa 1965
Soviet-built synth using a 25-pitch microtonal scale" thing is fun for a novelty
listen, but if it doesn't _sound_ cool to you or someone else, who cares? The
sound designer's goal as I see it is a greater multiplicity of means (synth,
sample/computational, and "acoustic" instruments included), so that you might
stumble upon some interesting ends.

And let's not forget that it's what you do with that cool sound once you'
ve found it, music-wise, that ultimately matters.  :)

	Generating original sound and recording/playback are different realms. 
In recording and playback, the digital machine need only do a quick 
sample and write that or reproduce it. The problem with generating the 
sound is you need algorithum to sound it. Unless you have an analog 
machine, you are in effect screwing with (damn I for get the two series, 
one makes good drum noises, well it supposed to, and is used in FM chips 
that you might find on your sound card if you have one). The analog 
machine actually directly manipulates the current and voltage to produce 
noise through speakers. And it is quite difficulkt to approxiamte a twist 
of a pot with a math equation....

True... but you don't get the same control over the sound that any analog synth
gives you.  With analog, you never get the same sound twice, and in order to
get that kind of control, as someone mentioned, you'd need monster computers. 
Stick to analog, if you want an analog sound.  Easy enough!  The comparison
between analog and digital is the same as the comparison to CD's and records. 
Records offer a wider variety of frequency, and a more natural sound, although
for clarity, a cd works better.  But everybody I'm sure has had this debate
many times...

This talk about the 303 and analog vs. digital has got me interested.

One of my hobbies is math nerding on digital signal processing.

The way I see it is this. Analog synths have one major advantage over
sampling technology right now, and that is simply that analog synths
give much more *parametric* control. What I mean is that there is
simply no counterpart in the digital domain to those nifty little knobs
that you have on analog synths. Sure you could sample a 303, but you only
get the sound that you've set. The range of timbres on the original
instrument is lost. Of course if DSP algorithms for modifying a starting
set of samples become available that have a similar utility to those
knobs, then it will be a whole different story...

Analogue lets you hear the electrons in all their chaotic glory, digital is a
programmers version of it.  When asked if people would find virtual reality
more appealing than reality, Jaron Lanier responded, "No, virtual reality is
too predictable and people will get board no matter how good the simulation."
My take is that our minds are optimized for the analogue and are extremely
senstive to subtle variations in the environment.  These subtle changes are
neccesary to keep us awake and focused on living.  Lacking these subtle
quantum varitions, digital puts us to sleep and makes us lose interest.
It is said that frogs cannot see their prey unless it is moving, humans
can't see the world with their minds unless they are analogue.

I suspect that in our life times, digital will be sufficiently complex to
keep our attention.  That day will come when clock speeds are theoretical
limits, memory storage cannot be measured except by complex physical models,
and processing power is doled out in grams.  And then, once humans have
mucked around so much in virtual reality that no one can remember what they
did and the permutations of effects cannot be predicted, essentially casting
the human spirit into a digital mold, will VR will become livable.

Pure what?  I can assure you that there are sound chunks that I can 
sample digitally that you will have an *extremely* hard time synthesizing.
A spoken phrase of human speech, for example.

Gee, you seemed wide awake that last time I saw you dancing to the
digital beat of a drum machine.  The (near) perfect control offered in
the digital realm allows us to transcend many of limitations imposed on 
us by nature's chaos.  That doesn't make it better, just different and 
therefore one more tool for our use. 

> It is said that frogs cannot see their prey unless it is moving, humans

The one thing that is cool about being human, is that we can *conceive*
of things that we cannot expereince.  We understand what a perfect
triangle is, yet none exist in nature.  When we trance out to a perfect
beat, we transcend the reality from which we evolved.  I find it sad,
but respect, the choice of most humans to experience existence like a frog.

> I suspect that in our life times, digital will be sufficiently complex to

Complexity for the sake of complexity can be quite boring.  Sometimes
we *want* the simplicity and purity of control that digital offers. 
A musician who says "I only use analogue" is like a painter who says
"I only use pastels".  That is fine for people who only like pastels.

Some of the software I write already behaves rather unpredictably, so
I guess we are almost there. :)

Realize that in the end, both are the same.  It just depends on how you look

With all of the money being spent to tell everyone that the above *is* what 
raves are, we can't really compete for the mass audience. We're just 
going to have to do it one person at a time :)

Good point -- there are *lots* of techno artists who don't even use a 303.
I say: who needs it?  I've had one in my studio for the past year-and-a-half
and we hardly ever touch the thing.

Hi All,

Sorry, but I'm not going to get all dreamy in my shorts about the Blue
Angels. After hearing that the Navy spends half a billion dollars a year to
keep these fancy stunt pilots doing aerial nintendo in the sky--pardon me if
I don't ooze patriotic red, white and blue.--I remind you, the Blues Angles
are a Half Billion dollar flying commercial for an all-volunteer army.

Those planes are also flying a 400 to 500 miles per hours over densely
populated areas, as Laura attested to.  And, I don't see those death defying
manuevers as inspiring-It really is a kinda of Russian Roulette in the
sky--which endangers people on the ground, and forces pilots to flirt with
death if they expect to keep their job. 

 I heard there was a smog alert over the weekend, and yet these planes were
allowed to fly..How much fuel do those things burn anyway? Even as a social
make-work program, there are to costly and ineffective.

I guess I'm just disgusted today after I read about the Shell Game the
military is playing with base closings. The article says that 26 bases which
were supposed TO CLOSE, remain open, and anyone who seriously believes that
the government is taking money away from the drug war, to spend on the Blue
Angels, is probably sucking nitrous at the speed of sound.

And.........What all this has to do with Raving, I don't know..
except that the PENTAGON  warlords are STARK RAVIN MAD!!!!
We arm the world, so we can protect ourselves from it. 

Never in the history of mankind, have so few, spent so much, to kill so many.
And never, have we been so unsafe. (see the book, Voltaire's Bastards)

I guess I'm just pissed that people seem to have this Disneyland in the sky
attitude about this. Isn't it nice that the Navy provides these high-tech
fireworks for us, little sonic farts,  while the San Jose library doesn't
have a decent set of encyclopedias, etc.  Hooray for your tax dollars at
work!!!!

(In there here we go again file),  we're set to see Saddam Hussein II on  TV.
WE can go marching on to the next pablum for the people.  Didn't we win that
war anyway? The media told us so.  It wasn't until afterward, that we found
out the truth about "smart bombs," "friendly fire.," and the"scuds." 

Let met apologize before hand for this post-flame explosion. I realize that I
am still furious about the Vietnam war. I didn't like being a political
pariah then, and I don't like being conned today.  Nothing personal.

                                                   Peace & Respect

Greetings from Sunset!

I want to thank everyone who came out to the Presidio on Sunday, you all 
made the experience sweet even though it was short.  Thanks to you, the 
family vibe was with us again despite our difficulties with the generator 
and the park authorities (rangers, park police, and military police).  
Also, everyone was very cooperative in making the alcohol scarce and in 
cleaning up the trash.  Thank you all!

I would like to take a minute to thank the authorities for being so 
cooperative with us, both in the Presidio and in the Marina.  In both 
locations we were allowed to continue our party without permits, and were 
given information on obtaining permits.  These people have shown us their 
enlightened judgement and have bent the rules to accomodate us.  They 
deserve our respect, cooperation, and praise.  On the behalf of all of 
us, I thank them.  Our experiences with them have inspired me with hope 
and optimism for our society and I urge everybody not to stereotype them 
into the "pig" category.  Also, I think it's important to remember that 
they have to do their job as it is mandated to them whether they like it 
or not.  We have to make sure not to push their flexibility by being too 
obvious about other activities.  As to undercover police, which are 
around from time to time, I hope that they enjoy their assignment at our 
parties and report back favorably (and dance lots too!).  Our party is 
for everybody to enjoy!

This weekend, the Sunset crew is going camping at the Russian River for 
the Tribal Future party.  We are bringing our sound system and DJs out to 
have an new-fashioned ho-down and nature lurk.  Come ready to dance and 
swim and bring camping stuff.  For more info call (415)750-9452.  Hope to 
see you all there, we'll have a blast!

Thanks and lots of love, Lorien (helagon@well.com)

simply put into a church? Is there service? Are aetheists welcome? Do i

                       I WANT A SHIRT WITH BUGS IN DRAG!

Mijos, can anyone help me? 
It has long been known that Bugs, in the tradition of Milton Burle, Micky
Rooney, Dean Martin, Bob Hope, and other Vegas lounge greats, loved to don
the dresses. 
Now, with all these looney toons shirts goin' round, i have not found my
place. The 'tude toons shirts don't cut it. Nor do the plain ones of poky
or daffy in that circle thing.

                       I WANT A SHIRT WITH BUGS IN DRAG!
You know, when he does the Carmen Miranda (Chiquita Banana to some) with
the clogs and loud dress and fruit on his head? Does anyone know how to get
that drawing/print? or if it can be downloaded from anywhere, or is there
an archive in some film school or library? Would one of the Warner Bros.
(or sister Dot) be able to supply it?
I promise i'll not "Sssssssshhhhhhhhmack!" kiss you if you help me!

Th-th-th-that's all, folks!
 Milton and the E-Bee..........

Would you eat bread knowing that the grain once came from a proud stalk

Those that think analog can do anything that digital can't need to
chug on down to their local university and read up on audio theory.

Digital can perfectly emulate anything our ears can hear. Whether or
not it is _done_ depends on the quality of equipment involved, and on
the skill of the human doing the programming.

As marginal sampling rates, poor DAC, bad mastering, and a plethora of
other sloppiness have shown us, it usually isn't done. But it can be.
It's much like the situation with digital movie effects. Yeah, you can
tell the difference between the real thing and the special effects,
but every year it gets closer and closer. And once in a while, they
make you believe. I consider it a good thing. The more it makes
possible, the more there is to enjoy.

Bashing "digital" is as silly as bashing "analog". Personally, I think
most of both sucks. One needs to take it case by case.

Please bear in mind that even though we can admire these planes for the
POWER that they have and represent, they are the same as automatic rifles,
there main purpose is to Kill human beings.  We may get goose bumps and a sense
of pride as they fly low over our heads but, think about the feelings that
a 5 year old child will have in Bagdad as this very same sound heralds
her imminent death.

I don't think that was the argument at all, if I've been following 
anything.  You are correct in saying that CD-quality digital music can 
*recreate* any sound humans can hear, but the debate it seems has been 
over the *synthesis* of sound.  Think of speech - it's totally possible 
to record a human voice on CD and play it back later without any 
difference, but I haven't yet seen or heard of a speech machine that 
could convert text to human speech so perfectly it was impossible to tell 
the difference between that and a real person.  Not yet, at any rate :)

Can we end this conversation now?  Thanks.

This is the rave being put on by Father Matthew Fox, an excommunicated Dominican (?) priest, who I was asking about a couple of weeks ago. There was an article about the guy and his perspective in SF Focus, August (?) issue. Seems like an interesting bloke, working with some dudes from England to establish what they call rave mass, using the community vibe of raves to create a new sort of 'church'. There's a heavy technology bent, and they'll have lots of monitors set up w/ talking heads spouting the Word. It doesn't sound especially reverent or somber, sort of taking more of a Creation Spirituality angle.

DEFINITELY go dressed as a nun, my friend! You will be the life o' the partee...

If I were going, I think I'd dress as a pagan.

Already has, Steve :)  Ever heard of fourier analysis?  300 oscillators

No, this is not another analog/digital synthesizer post.

This is a gentle reminder to everyone that this is a virtual 
community, and many times the quality of life in this community
is defined by a high SIGNAL to NOISE ratio.

I know that rave is connected to a lot of things that are happening
in the world right now, and it is interesting to talk about.  But, 
with 900 people subscribed, I think we need a little more focus.
I try and move my discussions that are not directly rave-house 
related to e-mail.  It's faster and more like a person-to-person
conversation.

I think Gary got his information from someone watching way too many Janet
Jackson Music Videos.  What rumors can do! (sex on the dance floor)...
I wish (NOT).

But indeed it is our responsibility to educate...one by one if need be.

I'm curious how people handle high-volume mailboxes... something about an 
automatic filter/sorter shell program?  I'm having a wee bit of trouble 
keeping up with my mail lately and haven't been able to reduce the amount 
of messages in my inbox to less than 200 before more comes in.  There 
must be some sort of method for handling this information?

Why should we REALLY care what the mass audience thinks of raves?  What 
matters to me are the people in the scene and how we all interact 
together.  Those are the people who have the most impact in my 
life.       By the way, my name's Amy and this is my very first message 
and I feel like I know alot of you from just reaing the bulletins for the

I can't resist pointing out that (non-sampling) speech synthesizers
use the same technology as analog synths (oscillators, filters, etc). I
agree that they don't sound like real voices anymore than analog
synths sound like "real" instruments.

I agree. It's degenerating into a religious war.

Well folks, I have been on the sfraves list for about a month and I am just
about convinced that there is no better vibe in the country than what you
guys have got.  I am stuck here in TX, freshly graduated from college in May.
Needless to say, the rave scene here is...well, not what your's is.  And the
social vibe is all but snuffed by arrogant Texans.  How 'bout them Cowboys?
Anyway, I must leave this God-forsaken place soon and am weighing my options.
By trade I am a radio producer and DJ.  Finding work in this field is tough,
even if you're really talented.  (I've won several broadcasting awards.) I
am also a techno artist, and I feel my stuff is pretty slammin.  I want to 
find an environment where I can work professionally and still have an outlet
for my music.  SF is a big market and probably *really* hard to find a job in
radio, so I'm willing to look for other work if need be.  I don't know a soul
in SF, and I don't have the guts to come out with no job lined up and no 
place to stay and hope to survive.  I graduated cum laude (3.6 gpa) and I
am technically minded and brighter than most Texans.  I also have digital
multitrack recording experience in both radio and the music industry. (Music
was my major in college.)  I know this a long shot, but you all seem so
genuinely nice I figured it was worth a try:
Is anyone in a position to help me find a job out there?  It doesn't matter
what area it's in, as long as I can make enough to get by.  I was hoping
that maybe someone on this list owns their own company and needs help.  Say
for example you own a small software company, I can compose music and design
sound effects for your software.  OR WHATEVER!!!  I'm in a very unhealthy
environment here and I need to leave within a couple weeks.  (Well, I'd like
to anyway, for reasons to complicated to list here.)  I hope that there's 
someone there who can help.  I can send resumes and references if you want em.
Thanks in advance.  I'm crossing my fingers that the right person reads this.

As far as I know Matthew Fox was not excommunicated (catholic church hasn't
done that in a while, I think)... However, he was  *silenced* by Rome, i.e., 
the same body that ran the inquisitions way back when witches weren't cool :)
Some gentleman called Cardinal Ratzinger is running it now.. he  personifies
conservatism...

Anyway... He quit the Roman Catholic Church and 
I believe all he's trying to do is bring his own Creation Spiritiality
message to younger people by way of a rave mass... not trying to 
take over the rave scene :)  Anyone that has been "silenced" by the papacy
has gotta be sorta cool :)  I may go, but it sounds like it may occur right
at the same time as a good Sat Nite Halloween rave :) ... so if ya had a 
choice of Wicked or Matthew Fox...

 its hard to let even the individual know what a rave really is too.  I mean,
in everyday contact with people they almost look upon raving with disdain
rather than curiousity.  And not everyone needs to have a "right" vision of
what a rave really is.  People will see what they want to see whether or not
the facts are presented clearly.  Just as long as we reflect a positive image
then thats the most we can do.

I few months ago (april), some of us SFRavers met with Matthew Fox for 
a meeting-of-the-minds about all this.  My review of that meeting
can be found under the under the "culture" directory of the
"Spirit of Raving" page on hyperreal.  Use a Web browser, or you might 
be able to FTP to it.

http://hyperreal.com/raves/spirit/culture/MatthewFox_mtg

Some threads about christianity & raving can be found there as well.

This won't help you find any parties, but since you're going to be in 
L.V......   I went there last summer and if you like laser shows you 
GOTTA check out the Luxor after dark!  It is soooooo incredible what they do.
The only thing missing is the music.  Bring a walkman with a Tony tape 
and you'll be set!!!!!
        Hope you do find some parties, though.  I didn't when I was there.
                                       good luck,
                                                      Amy

Well, since i know absolutely nothing aobut synthesizers...

The dude who was showing off the VL1 as this thing i went said that
it's basic concept was that you programmed in things like
length, diameter and stuff like that of wind instruments
and it would emulate them

You can do tons of impossible things like a 1 km long, 1 cm diameter
flute, or, of course, a 1 cm long, 1 km in diameter one too..
(well i dont know aobut that.. but you get the point)
although there are quite a few other options to play with,

i wonder what type of physical dimensions would be in a instrument
that would make it play like a 303?
(not like i can remember what a 303 sounds like with the pitch at 0 :)

don't ferget that EVERY purchase you make, for blo-pops or sugar pops,
  goes into a VERY large chain of suppliers, vendors, etc., and that
    implicitly you are keeping their beliefs/politics/etc going;

a classic example is Mitsubishi, who clearcuts forests like there's
  no tomorrow;  buying one of their shiny cars is indirectly supporting
    those activities....

if you're really serious about not imbibing anything whose source is bad,
  yer not gonna buy ANYTHING; that's the truth, cause (nearly) everything
   you see on a store shelf has SOMEONE's doodoo innit.

back to da raves...

Well, I think digital has its place,as wellas analog having its place.  Just as
tb303 has a great bass sound, a fucked up square wave has a pretty cool sound
unto itself!

As an aside, does anyone know if Future Sound of London uses predominantly
analog or digital?  Obviously, I have their albums on cd, but all that wildly
oscillating noise and electronic moans... Is it analog or digital?

Matthew Fox is now in the Episcopal Church. Though I'm  not exactly 
sure of the details of his departure from the Catholic Church it was not 
a friendly parting of ways.

The rave mass is being produced by an alternative community from 
Sheffield, Enlgand who have  been prodcuing "sacred rituals" for  17 yrs 
which incorporate new media, ecological awareness and personal & 
communalexperience of mystical spirituality. The group is seeking to 
forge alliances with kindredd d spirits and open a dialogue for exploring 
grass roots solutions to some of our most pressing social & ecological 
problems.

I will be giving a talk with Matt next week on raves at his Institute In 
Culture & Creation Spirituality in Oakland. I will report back with 
relevant info.

If you are interested in knowing more about Matt Fox's ideas I recommend 
his new book _The Reinvetion of Work_ (Harper SF, 1994)) Should  be in 
some public libraries and local bookstores. Though I am aware that it is 
somewhat difficult to overcome the aversion to certain connections to 
mainstream religion Matt is very revolutionary and has worked for over 
20yrs for social justice and ecolocial spiritual  transformation.

Check out the amorphous androgynous*tales of ephidrina CD sleeve for a
sampling of the fsol equipment list. They definitely love their samplers, 4
akai s1100's fully loaded with 32Mb, i mean really! They also have alot of
analog gear. I am sure that they could take just about any random digital
or analog synth and make it sound delicious.

Mijos, i want to have a good time at the russian river. One detail: i'm
very dependant on YOU!
 so, everyone who can, do go, it makes my party that much better when i see
my good fellow ravers! I'll take a big six person tent (i'll try) so the
tentless can join us..... you can rent them cheap from Cal Adventures at
berkeley, probably other schools, too...

I heard the mud in the river is excllent for body painting. Looks like a
savage weekend...damn! I haven't been able to go camping so long, fraid of
missing a good party (Rave slave!), but this looks like my lucky day (daze)
so see you there!

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee....

Hey gang!

Been surfing the list now for a few months, getting a good idea about 
what the vibe's like, and waitin' for the perfect opportunity/event to 
take the ravin' plunge. Well, its HERE!

Tribal Reunion sounded like such an excellent event all the way around, I 
decided I'd drop all plans to attend. Fortunately, nothing came up to 
foil my plans, and now I have a chance to meet all you bee-yooteeful 
people up in Healdsburg this weekend. It's gonna be SUCH a trip! Camping, 
drumming, honoring our Mother, connecting in the fine outdoors in what 
looks to be PERFECT weather...makes me wanna drive up there right NOW!

Pant, pant. Anyway, I hope to meet LOTS of you fine SFRavers this 
weekend. I'll be the big boy in the sky-blue bandana with the dreamy look 
in his eyes. Freek me out! Walk up and say HI JAxUN!!! 

I'm all giddy...

Sure, just about everything on the shelf is bad.... Hmm.... Certainly,
there's products and stores around (esp. in SF) where one can be a fairly

I heard there is going to be a rave at Theta Chi house at Stanford on
friday. No, I'm probably not going. Last I recall, Theta Chi is a co-op
or self-op or no-op or something like that in the Cowell Cluster. But
it's been a long time and I may be confabulating (I'm the CONFABULOUS
FOUR, ALL-IN-ONE! Jimmy Hoffa's living behind my THIRD NOSTRIL! I've
got a NIETZSCHE TRIGGER FINGER and I don't shoot blanks!)

Anyways, I'm posting cuz I figure someone might want to know. Anybody
know the DJ line up? I've heard some of the KZSU DJ's spin some killer
shit, so perhaps it will be ok.

This was sent to me as a forward from someone -- I have not seen it on 
the list, so I'm just hoping that it wasn't posted all over and I just 
missed it.

PLEASE read this -- anyone concerned with helping the parties go more 
smoothly (with less harassment from Mr. Ossifer) should know the basic 
rules about what cops can and cannot legally do. Who knows? Maybe the 
next time the cops come to your favorite party, *you* might have to answer 
the door!

    *************************************************************
                     **** DON'T TALK TO COPS ****
    *************************************************************

    By ROBERT W. ZEUNER, Member of the New York State Bar

    "GOOD MORNING! My name is investigator Holmes. Do you mind
answering a few simple questions?" If you open your door one day and
are greeted with those words, stop and think! Whether it is the local
police or the FBI at your door, you have certain legal rights of which
you ought to be aware before you proceed any further.

    In the first place, when the law enforcement authorities come to see
you, there are no "simple questions." Unless they are investigating a
traffic accident, you can be sure that they want information about
somebody. And that somebody may be you!

    Rule Number one to remember when confronted by the authorities is
that there is no law require you to talk with the police, the FBI,
or the representative of any other investigative agency. Even the
simplest questions may be loaded and the seemingly harmless bits of
information which you volunteer may later become vital links in a chain
of circumstantial evidence against you or a friend.

    Do not invite the investigator into your home! Such an invitation not
only gives him the opportunity to look around for clues to your
lifestyle, friends, reading material, etc., but also tends to prolong
the conversation. And the longer the conversation, the more chance
there is for a skilled investigator to find out what he wants to know.

    Many times a police officer will ask you to accompany him to the
police station to answer a few questions. In that case, simply thank
him for the invitation and indicate that you are not disposed to accept
it at that time. Often the authorities simply want to photograph a
person for identification purposes, a procedure which is easily
accomplished by placing him in a private room with a two-way
mirror at the station, asking him a few innocent questions, and
then releasing him.

    If the investigator becomes angry at your failure to cooperate
and threatens you with arrest, stand firm. He cannot legally place
you under arrest or enter your home without a warrant signed by a
judge. If he indicates that he has such a warrant, ask to see it.
A person under arrest or located on premises to be searched, generally
must be shown a warrant if he requests it and must be given a chance
to read it.

    Without a warrant, an officer depends solely upon your helpfulness
to obtain the information he wants. So, unless you are quite sure of
yourself, don't be helpful.

    Probably the wisest approach to take to a persistent investigator is
simply to say: "I'm quite busy now. If you have any questions that you
feel I can answer, I'd be happy to listen to them in my lawyer's
office. Goodbye!" Talk is cheap. But when that talk involves the
law enforcement authorities, it may cost you, or someone close to you,
dearly.

P.S.    "This leaflet has been printed as a public service
         by individuals concerned with the growing role
         of authoritarianism and police power in our society.

Subject: Rave Mass

I am going to re-post a short excerpt from an interview with a defrocked 
priest who is taking a different, more constructive approach to religion 
& spirituality than the Catholic church.

(the following has been excerpted, without permission, from San Francisco 
Focus magazine's interview with Fr. Matthew Fox)

SFFocus: Is there room in the Episcopal Church for your kind of spirituality?

Fox: I think so. I'll give you an example-- it's the main thing that's 
drawing me there. Last August, I had just finished writing "The 
Reinvention of Work'. The last chapter was on ritual, how we need rituals 
to create community support. We were doing a summer program in Seattle, 
and four people flew in from Sheffield, England. The oldest was a 33 year 
old Anglican priest, and their story was they have a community there of 
200 people, in their 20's reinventing the form of the Mass. The result is 
they have some 500 or so people coming to this Mass; average age 27. This 
is mind-blowing-- it's a miracle. There probably aren't 7 people in their 
20's going to church anywhere else in England on Sunday. These are 
blue-collar people. Sheffield is the Youngstown, Ohio of England, the 
birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, and it's in a total depression 
now. These young people come out of abusive situations-- economic, 
political, drugs, alcohol, all of it. They're plugged into the Rave 
culture there, and in the Mass they use Rave music and dancing and media.

SFFocus: Did you get an opportunity to see it firsthand?

Fox: I went over in November to experience it. It's held in the basement 
of a sports complex, a round room, and they have 42 television sets, 12 
videos, and projections all over the walls: galaxies dancing, to atoms, 
DNA, and so forth. The altar is a big, round white table with projections 
on it from above, colors and forms that change throughout the service, 
and they create the videos every other week for the Mass. There's also 
live television happening during the Mass, but the reading of the 
Scripture is on all the television sets and video screens simultaneously. 
   
The first response I had was that this is a very friendly experience for 
a generation raised on television. The second response I had was that 
these people are taking television away from the broadcasters. They're 
doing it live. Where? At the heart of a community. That's why it was so 
interesting and powerful. And yet it is the Mass-- you can recognize the 
form of the Mass within it.

I came back and talked with Bishop Swing in San Francisco, and we're 
planning such a Rave Mass in the basement of Grace Cathedral in October. The 
Sheffield Community is going to send ten people over, their best artists 
and techno artists, for a 2 year commitment to get the community going 
here in America, here in the Bay Area.

SFFocus: So this will be ongoing?

Fox: Yes. Eventually, we hope to coordinate the Mass with a conference 
for Silicon Valley on spirituality and TechnoArt. Technology is promising 
us 500 video channels and an information superhighway. But is that 
highway going to take us faster and deeper into the hell of consumerism, 
or can the new technology being born right here lead us to the next level 
of human evolution, which has to have something to do with spirituality? 
That's the challenge we want to give to Silicon Valley.

There are a few companies out there producing guitar amps that purport to 
digitally reproduce the warmer sounds a tube amp produces. Any data on these?

We don't care what people think raves are generally, but when you're 
trying to put on a good party *and* having to deal with drunk kids that 
have no sense (and are _very obviously_ looking for drugs) it tends to 
sour the mood a bit. Indiscretion on the part of minors at your party can 
get you *busted*.

And where do they get the idea that _that_ behavior is what a rave is 
about? Mass media -- CNN. Newspapers. Time Magazine. Etc. etc. etc.

Well, welcome to sfraves, Amy!  :) :) :)  

I'm Maui... Hope to meet you at Your Sister's House, F & F, the New Moon 
Rave, or one of the Liquid parties :) :)

Normally, I'd care less, but this IS the eve of RRTR, fer cryin' out

Take heart, some of the best camping trips I've been on have been during pouring
rain. You haven't lived 'till you've had lightning strike 20 yards away from you
in a flat meadow!

It's not God pissing on your party, it Him crying that He can't come down and
join you!

It really shouldn't be that hard to provide a digital approximation to
the "idealized" transfer function provided by a vacuum tube or FET
transistor. The basics of it is that these devices, when overdriven,
produce even harmonic distortion (there's a power of 2 in the txfer
function) whereas a transistor, when driven to distortion, has both
even and odd frequency components (there's a power of 3/2 in the txfer
function). Granted real vacuum tubes and real FET's don't have an
idealized txfer function, but the "warmth" characteristics people
perceive are simply caused by the even versus odd fourier components.
Nothing magical here -- every scientist enjoys reducing joy and
pleasure to formulas and computation!

It's been a long time since I did the fourier analysis of the
distortion characteristics of a tube, transistor, and FET so I may be a
bit confused on the txfer function characteristics mentioned above). It
was pretty fun intellectual masturbation in an otherwise heinously
boring electrical engineering upper level class. Geez -- all those
all-nighters of nasty electrical engineering problem sets in school
(while all my friends were out partying and getting laid! :-)) just so
I could quack about this BS on sfraves! (I probably can't even remember
how to do a double integral anymore -- 8 years of software engineering
tends to rot the mind, ya know!)

Yours in geekdom,
	Niels.

PS: w/r/t the "everything can be emulated by digital" -- this may be
true for already synthetic instruments recording straight into a mixing
board, but for capturing the  spatial information in a live recording,
44.1Khz 16 bit stereo absolutely butchers any high-frequencey
phase/timing information that helps us spatially locate different
instruments. Perhaps sampling at 100Khz might preserve some of this
information. Note that in high-end studios, you can occasionally find
systems that digitize at much higher sampling rates than 44.1K (CD) or
48K (DAT). Yes, I know all about Nyquist's Theorem -- but that just
has to do with frequency domain, and doesn't model human perceptual
understanding of sound and spatial location, which has components
of timing (time differences between sounds hitting your L/R ears,
phase, and amplitude between L/R ears).

fabulous!!!! I would LOVE to come to one of your parties and meet you, too!

As far as what you said about minors coming to parties just to look for 
drugs (and legal aged adults for that matter) I can see your point in 
that  maybe that is all these people think our scene is all about. My 
wish is
that they will come in the hopes of attaining something more than 
a high.  Maybe they will walk away the next morning with a different and 
positive perception of what we're about.  Why wlse would they be 
attracted to come to something so far away from "the mainstream" when 
they could go to some top 40 dance club and buy drugs there?  But then I 
don't want to be naive and think that everyone coming in is as open 
minded.      You probably have more first - hand knowledge of this since 
you put on parties while I mostly attend:)       
take care,
Amy

I find it really amusing when people complain about threads
and then quote a post that has a few screenfuls of text,
cuz thats a million times more annoying to me...
YMMV, i guess

Anyhow... for another non-rave related topic:

I just ran into someone who sells jewelry for body pierces
at some pretty nice prices, and it is tres good quality stuff
(pretty nice = like a 1/3 less than i normally pay)
anyhow... if you are interested drop me a line

normally i would throw soemthing blatently ravey in here,
but i kinda think that jewelry and music has something to do with raves

The situation is this:  Yes, there will be a party at Stanford.  With a
couple of excellent DJs as well.  (One of the Wicked DJs will headline).
The problem is that this party is a private Stanford party, and only people
who have Stanford ID's, or friends of the Chi Theta Chi house will be
allowed to enter.  The reason why this is so exclusive is because of
various liability reasons; it is a University residence and therefore they
are legally bound to restrict entry to non-campus partygoers.

Sorry about the delay - hopefully most of you get this in time.  The 
Russian River party looks like the best bet for those who can afford the 
time - otherwise Go Figure and Organic would be my picks for the 
weekend.  Whatever you do, have fun!  Oh, and if you pick up any fliers, 
don't forget to pass them along to Derek or I.... thanks!

Stonie and myself, from mother Earth s.s., will be playing at the river 
this weekend, and I'm really excited.  I haven't left Berkeley in far too 
long, and I haven't slept on the ground in even longer.  As a former 
boyscout and certified outdoor junkie, this is exactly what I need.  Hope 
to see lots of ya'll up there.  Please introduce yourselves, all will get 
hugs.  I'll be wearing my fishing hat with a smiley face patch on it, if 
I'm not running around naked or something, and playing some extremely deep 
house at some point.
(warning-not rave related) De La Soul is playing Townsend tonight with 
DJs Q-Bert and Mixmaster Mike, the two best hip hop DJs in the country, 
according to some contest somewhere.  Hope I make it to this.  House DJs 
do some amazing shit, but no one mixes like hip hop.  Ultimate cut and 
paste... oh boy... (21+, $16 at the door, $14 pre-sale at BPO and Zebra 
records)

love,
whitsitt

Whoops. Sorry 'bout that last one that should have been private, all.

After doing that about 40 times, one would think that I'd learn.

Is Tony down with CDC on a semi-permanent basis or 
is he just a guest this week?

	Furthermore, if raves have an evil image, god-damn youngsters 
going around and taking god knows what drugs, and having sex with god 
knows how many people, to that awful noise that just does the same thing 
over and over and over..., they are more likely to broken up on 
compliants. The general public has this thing of not wanting 'evil' 
things in their neighborhood. So the worse th image that the masses 
associate with loud techno coming over the hills, the more likely the 
cops will be called, and thus, the more likely the party will end. 
Granted the attitudes and atmosphere at parties may be counter to many of 
those accepted attitudes that dominate the minds of our neighbors in 
grand old country, and maybe they have reason to want to put an end to 
parties before their attitudes are called into question and -oh no- those 
attitudes might change a bit.... But why should we help them shut our 
gatherings down. Yet, I guess following my train of argument, one might 
think I was for putting up a false image of what a 'rave' might be, which 
I am not in favour of.... (hmmm, what is an image of a 'real' rave I 
wonder?)

I always thought CDC stood for Carlos Dutch Christophe.  (I wouldn't

Here it is again:)



Fingers, Inc "Can You Feel It"  accapella on Trax records 12"

                *** Jack's House ***

In the beginning, there was Jack, and Jack had a groove.
  And from this groove came the grooves of all grooves.
   And while one day viciously throwing down on his box,
Jack boldy declared, "Let there be HOUSE!" and house music was born.
"I am, you see, I AM THE CREATOR!, and this is my house."
 "And, in my house there is ONLY house music."
"But, I am not so selfish because once you enter my house it then
   becomes OUR house, and OUR house music."
And, you see, no one man owns house, because house music
        is a universal language, spoken and understood by all.
You see, house is a feeling that no one can understand really
  unless you're deep into the vibe of house.
House is an uncontrolable desire to jack your body.
        And, as I told you before, this is our house and our house music.
And in every house, you understand, there is a keeper.
                        And in this house, the keeper is Jack.
Now some of you who might wonder, who is Jack and what is it that Jack does?
Jack is the one who gives you the power to jack your body.
Jack is the one who gives you the power to do the snake.
Jack is the one who gives you the key to the wiggly worm.
Jack is the one who learns you how to walk your body.
Jack is the one that can bring nations and nations of all
        Jackers together under one house.
You may be black, you may be white, you may be Jew or Gentile.
It don't make a difference in OUR House.
                                          And this is fresh.

Ya know, this reminds me of something.  Only a couple of hundred  
years ago, witches were burned at the stake for ritualistically  
dancing around a fire in the nude, among other "evil" and "wicked"  
things.  This seems to be true of every movement which displays  
greater freedom of consciousness and expression.

I have this feeling that this will *always* be the case, for as long  
as there are people in the world who are so afraid of expressing  
themselves that they cannot allow others that freedom.  I'm afraid  
that as long as the rave movement continues, we should expect  
witchhunts.

Well to me, raves are natural anti-depressants.  Yes I go to raves
because:

	the music is happy
	the music gives me a natural high	
	I want a reason to eat lots of pixie stix, eat charms blue
		razzberry blowpops and dance all night
	I like the people
	The people are friendly and loving and caring and happy

acid house break-in 
get on
ride

truck go horse lift move launch
(mo' land fisher shake)

I went by Go Figure around 1:00.  It was in a large
apartment in the Mission.  Ambient patio and two other 
rooms.  40 or so people.  The music was shut down about
15 minutes after I got there ;(

Committed at this point I found a phone.
Parking was very easy and in a nice area.
I was a little early - the lights were on and final
preparations were being made.  I inquired about a bathroom and
one fellow told me to 'piss anywhere' in contradiction to a
sign put out later asking us to 'respect the property'.  My 
impression was that this guy was somehow affiliated with the
warehouse and not directly one of the party hosts.  I could
be mistaken ...

An Intimate Lounge connecting small offices to two large 
loading bays was absolutely Filled Solid by these stacks of
community speakers.  I was impressed with the sound.
It was flawless.  

During the setup period the music was Sick.
Soon they killed the overhead lights - kicked on a few 
flashy spinning colored lights - and started up the music 
again with some lighter funky house.  People started to arrive 
around 3:00.  The music built up a head of Steam quickly. 
Furious dirty acid has this sometimes not so subtle but very
emotional hook - imagine some Cosmic Bad Ass screaming -
"All aboard you Twisted Motherfuckers!!!!! "
You know enough midnight space language to Obey.   
You can't actually see the train but you have a sense 
of its total mass and cruising speed.
Without a doubt, you are On it.
Bust out the leathers, Coal furnace, Shovel the blackened
obscene God Damn shit onto my Head in this piss anywhere warehouse.
Let me tell ya girl, 
I like it.

I don't know who threw the party or who spun.
I only heard the first dj.  He was good.
I danced enthusiastically until I left.  
Groups of people were still arriving.

A million thanks to Mr White for his post!
Dave

I really hate it when promoters ruin their party by failing to have their 
voice mail act together,... thats why I really suck. I had to be in L.A.
this weekend and the voice mail filled up and i had the settings wrong so 
it saved fifeen seconds of silence every call, and collapsed when it 
reached its 2 meg limit. Michelle answered the phone by hand , but i have 
no idea how many people we failed to get directions to. Everyone is still 
up there.... 

when I got here today i turned of the computer and turned it on again and 
...of course it worked. I wish I had a reboot button so I could return to 
the factory settings when I start to get erratic.

salutations, allen@ameba

Someone please post this on the FTP site, because if I see this 
in mail again, I might just puke.  I used to play that a few 
years back, and it gets really annoying.  Just thought I'd let 
everyone know...  If you don't like it, too bad.  :)

hey, regarding the digital/analog discussion; KEEP IT UP!

 i'm a synth freak meself, and this is a great education just sitting
   here lurking...

 btw, even tho i'm a digital'ist thru-and-thru (i program lotsa platforms)
   i still gotta speak up for analog on one VERY important count:

   and that is CHAOS.

  yup, the forces of chaos are what keep the world going round; order
   just sorta emerges from the random alignment and synchronicity of
    erstwhile chaotic events... 

  what's that gotta do w/ synths? simple. if you want the truly chaotic
    sound, one which is utterly unpredictable, you've gotta go with analog
      components in at least part of yer waveform generation, because in
       most cases, digital can get repetitive at the micro-level...
  meanwhile, a humble transistor with it's middle pin cut can make a whole
    hellbroth of chaotic noise which even the best gaussian noise algorithms
      nary can touch...

(even less that .02 bux worth of opining...)

seeya!

I had some thoughts that didn't fit in with my
choo choo train review.  I decided to put them here.

What I wonder is how much repect does anyone show a
bit of property when throwing a renegade party?

At the very least, the party on friday happened
without some of the proper permits.  In the worst
scenario everyone there totally violated someone else's
property and space.  

For what reason?  
Because we really need to dance in different places?
Because the party was free?

I enjoyed dancing there.  It was fun.
But I have mixed feelings about how I treated
other people.  People I don't know.  Just to
go to a fun party.  

I think that I like a party where all the shit
is together.  Including a place in society and
respecting it.  It does not add any thrill for me
to be at a renegade as opposed to a club (or a park).  
Permits are not inherently bad.

Seeya
Dave

This sort of capsulizes the Tribal Phuture party at the Russian River
this weekend.  Good Music, Good friendly people, no somkey clubs,
no ass-hole security, no bar, no cops, just the river, music,canoes, the Moon.
stars, music, sunshine, fire, wind, food, music, sacrements, swimming,
talking, music, loving, caring, cleaning up the earth and some great music
by a lot of wonderful DJs who are rarely heard.  Many,many thanks to
the Ameba crew, the Mother Earth Sound system crew, Galen and the Pacific Crew,
Bryce, Al and Tracy, The Bus, Jason, Garth and the Chief for making this all
happen so wonderfully.


DJs to look out for:
	There were some excellent DJs that I have rarely or never heard
	that were absolutely wonderful:

		ELF - didn't he spin at the first sfraves picnic three years
		      ago?

		SOLAR - Really neat new stuff/ and some old :)

		TRACY - Get it girl!
			Tracy is clearly my favorite DJ right now. In my opinion
			she has what it takes to become a world class DJ.
			It's not the quality of her technique (which is good
			and can only improve) but she knows what record to play
			next AND she has a sensitiveity to the music that only
			comes from having journeyed to those realms by way of 
			the dance floor. Plus she's a capricorn which is always
			a good sign :)

		GALEN - As long as there are beings like Galen on this planet
			and in the Scene, there is still hope for us all.
			Galen has put a lot of hard work and effort into what
			he does and it is paying off not only for himself but
			for the whold group, (just imagine what it would be like
			if just 10% of the world could do this).  He is a
			prime example of what new energy in the Scene can
			accomplish. And definitely has made it to the upper
			ranks of what it means to be a DJ.

Basically, if I may so state, people have been taught that they are right 
to fear what they don't know or understand. Therefore their first instinct 
when confronted with something that is unknowable without investigation, 
such as a rave, is to call the "law" in to have it terminated with 
extreme prejudice. <sp?>

As far as putting up an "image" of what "raves" are -- can't be done. 
There are too many people involved, for one thing, and for another, you'd 
have to be the worst kind of Nazi to attempt it. Take a lesson from the 
gay community -- here we are arguing fiercely whether or not the "Year of 
the Queer" is appropriate as a theme; meanwhile lesbians, gay men, and 
transgendered folks are getting murdered in cold blood. 

Ravers are not ever going to win acceptance from the world at large, 
because our M.O. is totally at sixes and sevens with it. However, we 
should not let this discourage us... we don't need social sanction to see 
each other for the loving beautiful people that we are, and we don't need 
it to spread that love to those around us. So I say, rave on, my 
lovelies, and I'll be there with you... anyone we can bring along for 
this best of rides is more than welcome.

A report on Tribal Phuture party at the Russian River
=====================================================

   For those folks that missed a wonderful party,   all I can say,  is that you
missed a really wondeful time.     I got up there in the late afternoon,   
discovered that it was at the same campground as the Groove Kitchen a few
months back.    When I arrived,  they were just getting the sound system set
up,   and the first clean-up work party was just about to get started.    So
we grabbed our trash bags and started the Russian River clean up project.   This
earned me free addmission,  and food,  and we certainly made a "dent" in the
amount of trash and refuse around the river.

   When we finished,   the music had already started,   and after a big hearty
dinner,   I wasted no time in dancing to the funkey grooves.    The weather was
perfect for dancing,   and as usual,  Garth twisted my brain with his usually
high variaty of trance and funk.    Although we couldn't keep the music going
all night,    I made up for it by dancing almost all the time,  with little
or no breaks.    Eventually,   11 pm came around much too early,   so the 
dancing had to come to a stop.    

   Along the river bank,  they set up an Ambient system,   going all night long,
and people were sitting by the fire,  trying to keep warm in the cool crisp
evening.   I tried to crash,   but couldn't manage that,   so I just huddled
in my speeping bag,  watching the shooting stars all night long.

   The next day,  we were treated with a very efficient grill,   cranking out
pancakes for all who were hungry.    Eventually,  the music started again,  and
the dancing commenced.    It took me a while to warm my body up,  as I'm used to
dancing all night with no breaks,   but it didn't take long before I got into 
the groove as Tracey spun one of the best sets I've heard in a long time.   She
played some really old classics I haven't heard in a while,   and mixed them up
with some newer tracey stuff.    Jeno eventually came on,   but shortly after that,
someone complained about the noise,   but it was worked out that we could still
go,  but at a lower volume,  so people just migrated closer to the speakers,
and the grove picked up again.

   It was said that the music was to continue until 11 pm,  but that wasn't quite
so.    The music eventually stopped around 9 - 9:30 or so,   but everyone had a very
good time.     I would estimate about 80 - 100 people showed up.    I stayed there
overnight,  and helped with the clean up crew....   Had long talk with the owners,
who invited us to come back a a few months and have another rave.     But this time,
they will try and work it out with the neighbors and allow us to keep the music
on till much later....   We left with the campground all cleaned up,   and the last
crew tended to the canoes,  put them all away,   and we left and headed home.

   All in all,  these camp/rave events are so GREAT!!   No stuffy smoke filled
clubs,   no faschist security goons,   just a lot of happy smiling raver folks
having a good time,  out in the wilderness with nature.

   Hats off for Mark at Ameba for putting on this fine party,   as I'm sure going
to look forward for more in the future...

(Non Rave Related...sorry) Hi. Snowboarding season is coming (Yeah) but I'm 
lacking a good board partner willing to share travel/lodging expenses and  
basically enjoy the slopes (often) this winter. So any SFR snowboarders 
out there looking for maniac/housed-up/boardin-shots to Tahoe, plz give 
me a line. 
 
Thanks

Sort of recovered now from the Russian River party. (Discovered that 3
hours sleep on a picnic table just ain't enough =) )

This was the sort of party where you ended up meeting all kinds of people
because everyone seemed to know someone that you also knew. It was a
diverse yet connected group of about 200 or so enjoying the beauty of
nature, the music, and each other.

I got there at about 3:30 on Saturday when we set up the main system and
Whitsett (I think) started the music, which went until about 11pm in the
campground. I didn't get to hear many of the sets, but I liked what I heard
from Elf and much of what I heard from Garth.

There was ambient down on the beach all night, although many of the
attendees retreated to their tents. I thought Tobias in particular played a
good set and Bryce picked things up in the morning with some chunky tunes.

The main system got going in the afternoon again with a good deep set by
Jake. Solar played some great acid and Tracy rocked it, getting everybody
jumping. Galen closed out the night with a beautiful set and it was time to
clean up and go home.

Thanks much to the Amebas and Bryce and Galen and Alexander Valley
Campground for putting this all together. It was what all parties should
be. Hopefully there will be another next year, perhaps with a bluegrass
stage as well. =)

Just a small correction CC, that was Galen on the turntables not Jeno.

If I may be so bold, even a re-re-re-request for something is not such
a big bother.  If we're all here to help each other out, it seems like
a small price pay to read these kinds of requests occasionally.

*Especially* for something as historically notable as 'Jack's House',
which keeps showing up in samples on new tracks even now, because it
has something important and enduring to say about our scene, and because
the sound of that voice is so inextricably tied up with the entire 
history of house music.  

Just my opinion . . .

Thank you  phred!  When I requested the lyrics to this song, I didn't 
think I was going to cause such a ruckus! E-mailing me direct may have 
been a better option, but maybe it wasn't thought of.  Besides, if I 
personally don't want to read a posted bulletin I SKIP OVER IT.

Good point. I do tend to get impatient with certain aspects of the scene, 
but I shouldn't be obnoxious about it  :)
Sometimes my focus gets too narrow ...

I've always wondered about break-ins myself.  It's one thing to
be in a public space like a park after dark -- I mean really, what
does it mean to close off an open air area that is deadicated to
the public, you know?  But to me it's quite another to remove a
lock and sneak in . . . that really could count as breaking and
entering, which is even worse than the $270 and misdemeanor charge
Liquid participants got slapped with for violating the East Bay
Regional Park Service's 10:00 pm curfew for Oyster Bay.

This is something I can't pass up, though.  If you are responding to 
someone's post, or worse, an entire thread, must you quote the entire 
thread or post in your message simply to say "Yeah, me too" or something 
equally useless at the end?

Hyperreal is a lagged machine as it is, and there are around 350 people 
on sfraves, meaning any mail you send is sent out that many times (not to 
mention the million other things Hyperreal handles).

At any rate, please use some discetion when quoting in your posts.  
Besides, I hate reading yesterday's news :)

I just wanted to insert a comment that sometimes it is up to the organizers
of a renegade to provide the opportunity for everyone to help respect the
place you use.  I know that a lot of the renegade groups do things like
provide trash bags and such when the party is outdoors.  The Cloud Factory
provides trash bags, and then supervises the separation into recycling
bags, and tries its hardest to always leave a place cleaner tha nit was
before.  We've never done a breakin yet but we would try to follow the same
guidelines.  I always wonder about the ethics of breakins too but what if
the building is unused?  Isn't it a shame just to leave empty buildings all
over?  As an architecture major I think raves are a great example of urban
redevelopment :)

peace and love  Scott

When I first saw the DJ, I thought it was Jeno too.  There was the green 
jacket and a dark hat.  But after asking someone, it was Galen.

Saturday nite, we went to the wedding ceremony of Jon Drukman and
Ann Francis, two original SFRavers, though I don't think they are on 
the list anymore.  This was or first rave wedding, and it was a rather
moving experience.  It took place in a loft space that was used
for a Richie Hawtin party a year ago.  I'm usually not a fan of formal
ceremonies or rituals that are handed down to the masses by cultural
authorities, but this wedding ritual was created by the folks it was 
intended for, making it relevant and meaningful.

Ambient music, psychedelic projections, friends reading poetry
or short statements about friendship & love, candle lighting, humor, 
audience involvement, symbolism... it was all very warm and heartfelt;
a wonderful way to initiate the union of two individuals.

After the ceremony, the party took over.  We danced to great sets by Laura 
and Tamara, and spend a lot of time chilling with other people that we
knew.  This was by far the most enjoyable wedding we had ever attended.

Sunday morning we made our way to the Russian River Tribal Phuture,
arriving around noon.  It was like a little raver village with lots
of tents spread around and a big bus; a relaxed laid back scene with 
people mostly chilling/spacing out with nature in perfect weather.
I'm guessing that most people had shot their wad the day/evening b4. 
We headed down to the water and joined a contingent of canoers with
garbage bags to help with the river cleanup.  Bryce provided a nice
energetic backdrop on the Liquid Air soundsystem for us.  There was quite
a bit of garbage and it was obvious that it would take a more than one
environmentally conscious rave to finish the job.  But an important
statement was made along with some good karma for our community.

Perhaps it's just the outdoor parties that I've been attending lately, 
but I've started to notice a marked increase in ravers who seem to care
about their surroundings. At Russion River, I saw people diving into huge 
thickets of poison oak to retrieve garbage.  There will always be slobs 
amongst us, but perhaps the sight of just a few cleaning up will be 
enough to make lazier partiers a little more self conscious.  Well, we 
can only hope.

The canoing was fun;  In the river, there were a bunch of other 
canoers and swimmers, and we somehow managed to avoid smashing into a 
few of them. =%-}

We wandered back to the main campgrounds where Stonie was spinning some
nice tunes.  There were only about 20 people dancing, but there was a good
vibe.  We ran into a variety of SFRavers and other friends.  M Normal 
showed up and we checked out her ambient set back down by the river for a 
while.  Then Tracy took over the main system and was typically wonderful as 
the rave gathered some  steam.  Galen followed around sunset, appropriately 
enough.  Unfortunately, at around 7ish, the owner of the campgrounds said 
that he was getting noise complaints from 3 nearby ranchers, so the volume 
had to be turned way down.  This kinda killed the energy for us, so we 
called it a day.  But all in all, we already had had a great time, so no
complaints.  Next time, we hope to be there from the beginning.  Thanks
to Mark, Tracy, the Pacific crew, Bryce and everyone else who helped :)

Hello,

While I really sympathize with this viewpoint, 
I find that I am more likely to receive messages that are just the 
reverse, ie the person has not quoted *any* of the original message.

With many different messages arriving, sometimes it is difficult or 
impossible to figure out what the reply means.

For example, a stellar personality sent me a reply recently saying just:
"Well, yes, of course".  I still did have my last message to that person, 
and so knew what it meant, but in other cases, I am not so sure, 
especially in "list" messages.

Maybe people can find a happy medium between including nothing and 
including all the previous messages on the subject! :-)

-

respect to all,

I've been having so much fun with sfraves that I want to know if anybody 
has any access to rave-nets in my old home town of Seattle.  I would love 
to get on with Chicago and New York City also:)

I must say that I have never been able to come to terms with break-ins... 
While I do, to some extent, view "property as theft", I just can't seem 
to back up a break-in.

I am most curious to hear what other sfravers have to say about this..

Thanx!

Well, Kairo has been wanting the YSH crew to be featured at Megatripolis, 
and he and Susan have decided to do that this week, as our 'nads are in 
uproar after having to postpone 2 parties in a row!

DJ lineup:  Shoban
            Laura
            Tracy
            Charlotte

It looks like it will be a great party -- we're going to have the fiercer 
grooves of each of these DJ's

Call the YSH vmail 415.435.7575  and/or Megatripolis  415.281.KNOW
for more info.

peace, y'all....

SOUND TRAFFIC CONTROL's "THRONE OF DRONES" and "RE-IMMERSION"
Thursday 10 November & Friday 11 November, 1994
Club Townsend, 174 Townsend Street, San Francisco
 
"THRONE OF DRONES" and "RE-IMMERSION" are two of the more unusual 
electronic/ambient music events you'll see/hear this year in San Francisco. 
The shows, presented by SOUND TRAFFIC CONTROL (a Bay Area-based media arts 
collective), feature a unique real-time spatial audio system through which 
musicians, engineers, conductors, vocalists and DJs form an interwoven, 
surround-sound orchestra. Anyone who heard the Mixmaster Morris/Spacetime 
Continuum presentation last spring will find these to be a great follow-up.
 
Sound Traffic Control's audio/visual system is a 3D sound reinforcement 
network that projects music and audio animation throughout the room, 
creating sonic environments that stretch the boundaries beyond the THX 
audio arrays used in many theaters. "Sound Traffic Control" is also a 
metaphor: the "air traffic controllers" in the 3D Surround Hub pilot 
airborne "musical cargo ships" from different parts of STC's "sound world" 
utilizing separate/simultaneous "taxis," "takeoffs," and "landings."  The 
audience members are "passengers" who roam runways intersecting the dynamic 
musical trajectories.
 
Thursday's "THRONE OF DRONES" features the ISO-AMBIENT ORCHESTRA, a group 
of instrumentalists from numerous local bands and international solo 
projects whose real-time virtual performance is akin to an Internet-style 
online experience. Iso-Ambient Orchestra members include: Joe Gore; Chris 
Muir; Michael Belfer (Torcher); Anton Newcombe (Brian Jonestown Massacre) 
and Larry LaLonde (Primus) and a host of others. Later on the same bill is 
David Darling, solo cellist, whose evocative music provides an atmospheric 
melancholy. Those familiar with his CD releases on the ECM and Hearts of 
Space labels should witness his inauguration into the 3D sound field. Along 
with this, arrives the Acid Karaoke of Carl Stone and oriental singer Mien 
Xiao-Fen. Stone is an internationally-known electronic music composer who 
has traveled extensively and released many wild and whimsical works for New 
Albion and other labels. His music, in combination with Mien Xiao Fen's 
exotic vocals, should transform the event into a department-store frenzy. 
DJs for the night are not your usual fare: ethnic/world specialist Cheb i 
Sabbah will create a multilayered tribal/space mix; Jonah Sharpe is back 
from England with a fresh new collection of tracks; and debuting on 
"digital transport" will be the creator, co-ordinator and curator of Sound 
Traffic Control, Naut Humon. The Drones begin at 9 p.m., tickets are $6.
 
Friday's RE-IMMERSION, presented in conjunction with Ambient Jungle, adds a 
festive element to the occasion. Appearing with STC will be Spacetime 
Continuum, a techno-ambient convergence from the Astralwerks label guided 
by Jonah Sharpe, whose aural exploits include collaborations with Bill 
Laswell, Peter Namlook and Deep Space Network. The evening's lift-off will 
be provided by Reflective Records' Single Cell Orchestra, who explore the 
mysterious underside of the ambient phenomenon through chromatic 
transpositions and narrative form. For those who continue to dance, DJs 
Mark Farina, Thomas and Felix will spin atypical house- and techno-beats in 
the Dubzone. Macross Vision by Hyperdelic will fill the Dubzone with 
synaesthetic color and light. Doors open at midnight, tickets are $10.
 
On both nights, the 3D sonic habitat will be punctuated by Perry Hoberman's 
"Symphonic Appliance System," which animates a garage-sale full of 
household gadgets including projectors, radios, records and electric tools 
in an audio/visual atomic-age setting.
 
The Audio Engineering Society (AES) convention for pro audio gearheads at 
San Francisco's Moscone Convention Center will run concurrently with the 
shows, so anyone looking for a futuristic sampling of audio technology 
outside the convention site need look no further. Sound Traffic Control 
uses a Level Control System from LCS, Inc. that sends multiple Macintosh 
digital audio workstation outputs live to discreet DSP mixer posts which 
are then forwarded to a 3D loudspeaker diffusion matrix.
 
For more information, contact Sound Traffic Control at (415) 522.7380

If you're realy interested in buying Jungle/breakbeat/uk hardcore/drum 
and bass stuff i'd recommend two dealers. If you're just a listener, 611 
REcords in Philadelphia. They are a fantastic record shop carrying pretty 
much everything and have a great bbeat section. If you're interested i 
have an email address but not on me now. Also, if you're trying to spin, 
and want the latest and greatest, i would most definitely recommend Lucky 
Spin Records in London. These guys are pretty much the ultimate jungle 
store, as everyting is happening in london now, and these guys have been 
there from the beginning. Again,for those interested i can get phone 
numbers, address, etc.

ps you also probably want to try the breaks mailing 
list....breaks@xmission.com. send a message to majordomo@xmission.com 
with subscribe breaks  in the body and they'll hook you up.

I don't think there's anything "magic" about a renegade, except
perhaps that they tend to draw certain types of people that I like
associating with. They also tend to be spontaneous and have little
production... it makes for a different kind of interaction than other
parties. I've met most of my good friends in SF this way.

Variety is good. I mostly attend renegades and small parties, and go
occasionally for the big blowout, especially if it has a good laser
show. Helping with parties is the best, I think, because it brings you
close with other people and it lets you put more of your personal
energy into the party.

I respect Laura's concerns on break-ins. I draw the line on break-ins
for several reasons, mostly safety and respect. Safety is important to
me; one can't protect guests from everything, but I feel one has an
obligation to deal with obvious and risky safety issues i.e. no stupid
risks.  This isn't easy to do at a break-in, where there can be all
sorts of surprises: Things fall from the ceiling. The rottweiler wakes
up. The circuit breaker trips at 15 amps but the wiring melts and
burns at 8.  People accidentally break something. The owner shows up
with a shotgun.  Armed thugs with badges take the sound system,
handcuff everyone, force them into trucks, and imprison them. You find
out the hard way that you're in a local gang hideout. Etc... There's
just too many unknowns, and I don't want a tragedy at my party.

The other important issue to me is respect.  You just don't break into
someone's property and have a party there. You ask. Just like you'd
expect someone to ask you rather than cutting the lock on your house
and letting hundreds of people inside. I personally don't want my
party to start with the karma of breaking-in to someone's space.

Now public property is free game. The way I feel about it, I paid for
it, and as long as I don't disturb anyone (much...any possible action
will disturb some californian) and leave the place like I found it,
then I'm perfectly in the right for using it. Statutes may disagree,
but most of the statutes are bad laws, blanket protections that hurt
responsible users by not taking things case-by-case. Even enforcement
knows this; they're usually pretty chill after talking with us and
having a look.

Just a quick review:

Indian Summer Daze on friday night was a lot of fun.  It was a very classic
house club.  It reminded me a lot of good house clubs in LA.  Everyone was
dressed real funky, and most people were really into dancing.  The location
was neat.  Above the street at 15th and Petrero, this fully legal club
had lots of UV, some strobes, plenty of sound.  The club was small, intimate,
and suprisingly cool.  But you could retreat to the rooftop chill area to 
(freeze!) also.  

The music was not particularly stellar, but the DJ (unknown to me), had
plenty of spirit+energy and kept the party going.  Unfortuantly, by about
4am there was plenty of open space on the dancefloor, but those of us who
were into it didn't seem to mind much.  I'll look forward to future Dazes.
We payed a 5 dollar cover to a friendly door person.  Age span was about
18-23, and the crowd was really diverse.  Enjoy!

I find this statement odd, in that no Californian/sfraver I can think of 
would make such a comment about any other state...

As a native, I am rather tired of getting dissed merely because I am *from 
here*.

hello folx,
thought u might be interested in couple of items next week:
on the 24th of october, dr. daniel matt of center for jewish studies at
grad. theol. union will talk about "god and the big bang" at temple
beth am, 26790 arastradero, los altos hills, 415.493.4661 at 7:30 pm.
then, on wed., october 26 i will be talking on physical and metaphysical
cosmologies at san jose state univ., in business bldg., rm 124 at 6:30 pm.
more immediately rave related, i really recommend "lacho drom", a beautiful
movie about rom people and their peregrinations from rajastan to spain.
most of the movie is music the rom people play, with few words spoken.
there is a small drawback in that few of the words of the songs are
translated. but we can see in wonderful detail how music is an integral
part of the rom peoples' lives. the music is great, as is the dancing
we see. i could barely contain myself in my  seat. oh, it is playing at
uc theater on university near shattuck in berzerkeley until the 20th.
take care/shalom
ovid

I believe this movie's also at the Castro in SF til the 21st(?). Truly 
worth seeing; as Ovid said, the music and dancing are incredible.

I guess what I figured out is that the "someplace your not supposed
to be" part doesn't excite me.  It struck me as silly.  I felt a
like a juvenile deliquent.  A hooligan.

The space used was ideal.  It was basically perfect.
I understand the cost/energy motivation for 'using' a space.

However, I definitely picked up on this sense of excitment *because* 
of the break-in aspect that I didn't share with others.  I was excited 
because it was an otherwise nice party.


**********************

More Cool Californians 

I went to What's Happening at the cocodrie on Tuesday.  It was
really empty and the music was odd/funky/clubby and uninspiring.
It had a nice sized dancefloor.

Counting on an extremely small cover charge and free water 
I went over to Butterfly @ Cassanova.  Comfortable bar. 
Nice people.  Freaky easy hiphop to bass solid house.
I haven't heard this kind of music anywhere lately.  
My cup of tea.  I thought Charlotte was amazing.  So precise.  
Almost made me want to check out Megatripolis this week ... $$$
Butterfly is very cool.  I am going back when I can afford a beer.

After a beautiful day in the forest last Sunday, we got around to longing
for some thumping drums toward sunset time.  So, I was wondering
if anyone on this list knows anything about making a drum or two?
I have tools and stuff so that's not a problem.  Has anyone made their own
or can you recommend a how-to?

Thanks in advance!

I remember my stepdad making drums out of shoyu barrels and rawhide --

hi everybody, while most of you were probably at the russian river last
saturday, i checked out megatripolis.  i was actually helping out gramme
and reed (and david too) with setting up internet access at the troc.  boy
what a hassle that was!  its hard to maintain a connection when the sushi
bar picks up the line while you're wwwebbing.  i think frazier said they
will be getting more lines for dedicated computer access.  that will be cool.

there was only one "real" phone line, david set up this windows
machine and demoed "mosialla?" (mark p. help me with this if your out
there), which is a mosaic www browser that has more robust features than
the NCSA's version.  anyway it was fun playing with that and david's other
pc eye candy.  it will be nice to get more computer playthings there in
the furture.

i brought my portable too but with one phone line avaiable i checked out
the party.  i was pretty sparse compared to the only other time i was
there which was opening night.  i figure alot of people were doing the
russian river.  but things picked up after 2am.  i really didn't mind
there was more room to dance, it wasn't too hot and it seemed more than
half the people there were ON: lots of smiles and dancing among the people
there provided tangible positive energy.  i think megatripolis is one of
those parties where you dont have to trippin to have a good time. 
although one of these days i'll have to, the environment is ripe for that.

denis peron's talk was really moving.  the parallel universe series is
something that an adult like me appreciates.  it was really magic when
denis announced in the middle of his talk that he was tripping and carried
on without missing a beat.  seriously though medical marijuana is
something worth supporting.

I too have seen this, Mijos, and he is right! Don't miss this, especially
for the fig tree in the desert, covered with candles and a beautiful
dancing girl under it, spinning and releasing the stars. The percussion is
incredible, and the charm uncomparable. don't miss it, if you do, hey,
you're missing it!

Lotsa love
 Milton and the E-Bee....

Btw: cinema rec: easy rider still on haight? And don't miss the vibe-movie,
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, this movie is about raving!

Lets see... maybe where virtual volleyballs (made from "samples" of real 
volleyballs) come at you from any direction, with no regular pattern?

Or perhaps volleyball that you only play:
- when you are tired of frisbee?
- when you don't like the frisbee referee this hour?
- when you really just want to talk to someone, but in frisbee, you are 
too far apart to hear?
- when you are just walking in between the frisbee area and the toilet?

Hello,

Has anyone on sfraves attended a Full Moon in the last couple of months?

If so, could you review it?

Thanks!


( PS I'm too far away to attend any event with so little advance notice, 
unless someone has a spare Lear jet... :-) )

Well for those keeping track, I'm at 367 pieces of mail and rising.  It's 
just like that scene in The Shining where all the blood is rushing out of 
the elevators - well for me it's e-mail spewing out my inbox.  

Okay there seems to be a lot of shtuff to attend in the south bay as far
as club-type events.  It's good music and only a small quantity of 
people... so I'm going to keep blurting these out if you don't mind:
(I know these are already in the calendar, but I just wanna comment..)

Monday:  Free Life at Greg's Bar in San Jose
	Cozy little bar with hardwood floors and unfortunately a large
	mirror.	9-2am but crowd doesn't come in til like 11pm.  From then on
	everyone gets into the housey tunes. Good mix of people gay/straight
	you name it.  There's an outside "backyard" where people gab and 
	hang out which is interesting.  Usually Harry Who, Rick Preston, 
	and lotsa others

Tuesday: Groove Room at Waves in Los Gatos
	I've only been once.  Another cozy dance area with a big screen
	TV with strange videos playing.  younger crowd, minimal light effects
	I get a basement feeling in this space.  The DJ is away from the 
	speakers so it's kinda disjoint.  Alonzo and others

Wednesdays: Buzz at the Oasis in San Jose
	lately it's been empty in the house room unti like 10:30 or 11pm 
	and then things start picking up.  Always cool slide visuals and 
	an occasional smoke machine misting.  Lots of room and good 
	ventilation.  Jacked up DJ booth like any other club but good 
	sound system. Lots of funky hi tech lights and almost always a bongo
	drummer in a corner for the tribal beat.  Seen all kinds of DJ's here.
	Rick Harry Spun Garth Markie Loren many more.

Thursdays: Velvet Shop in San Jose
	This reminds me of a big cabana or something.  It's a very 
	centralized feeling to be in the dance floor... you're surrounded 
	by people on just about every side and it's usually dark and very 
	friendly.  DJ is at  the corner of the dancefloor a-la rennegade
	style and even the speakers look portable.  The crowd here is 
	lively from the very beginning until the very end from what I've
	seen.  Even though the bar is right nect to the dance floor it's 
	possible to dance and not even notice the drag queens and gawkers.  
	This thursday it's Rick Preston, Markie Mark, and Ryan.

Sundays: The Blue in Santa Cruz
	Sorry no data on this yet.  but my flyer sez:
	Dj's Loren, Mei-Lwun, Rick Preston
	$1 21+
	923 Pacific 408/684.3434

Oh yeah, Motion Wednesday the 26th should be good.  Great slanted floor 
to dance on.  The south bay sure is keeping me busy.

Ok it's time for Buzz.

Greetings to all...

I've seen a poster advertising a music convention down @ the
San Jose Convention Center the weekend of November 4-5. Does
anyone know anything about this, and if is, is it a worthwhile
visit for a soul interested in creating sound, but very 
ignorant as to how to do so?

One perk: it's free for those blessed with a school ID. 

Thanks in advance!

Lisa.

Hello Ravers,

I thought I'd drop you a line to let you know a bit more about what 
this "cathedral Rave" thing is all about. I am a Shefffielder whose 
been to their event. Firstly, I wouldn't describe it as a rave, 
at least not in the traditional English sense (continuous fast techno, 
flashing lights, lots of amylen nitrate and E). It is more like 
ambient yoga type vibes going down. They use alot of high tech video 
technology to lead people into a 'spiritual' experience. Lots of 
cosmological  techno imagery sort of stuff of science programs, DNA 
loops, black holes and shit like that. The music goes from ambient 
to techno house. Its quite an experience, difficult to describe,  
see for your self. 
I dunno where this idea that Mattthew Fox is running it has come from 
I know he visited the church in England this year but I'm sure its 
the Sheffield lot running it in San Fran. 

See ya 
if you want any more info drop me a line.

Tom

Thanx for the info.

How much Christian content will there be?

How long does it last, are people permitted to show up late?  Live
DJs, or is the music canned?

He's the one who invited the Sheffield folks to come over here.

   SOUND TRAFFIC CONTROL's "THRONE OF DRONES" and "RE-IMMERSION"
   Thursday 10 November & Friday 11 November, 1994
   Club Townsend, 174 Townsend Street, San Francisco

 "THRONE OF DRONES" and "RE-IMMERSION" are two of the more unusual
 electronic/ambient music events you'll see/hear this year in San
 Francisco.  The shows, presented by SOUND TRAFFIC CONTROL (a Bay
 Area-based media arts collective), feature a unique real-time spatial
 audio system through which musicians, engineers, conductors, vocalists
 and DJs form an interwoven, surround-sound orchestra. Anyone who heard
 the Mixmaster Morris/Spacetime Continuum presentation last spring will
 find these to be a great follow-up.

 Sound Traffic Control's audio/visual system is a 3D sound
 reinforcement network that projects music and audio animation
 throughout the room, creating sonic environments that stretch the
 boundaries beyond the THX audio arrays used in many theaters. "Sound
 Traffic Control" is also a metaphor: the "air traffic controllers" in
 the 3D Surround Hub pilot airborne "musical cargo ships" from
 different parts of STC's "sound world" utilizing separate/simultaneous
 "taxis," "takeoffs," and "landings."  The audience members are
 "passengers" who roam runways intersecting the dynamic musical
 trajectories.

 Thursday's "THRONE OF DRONES" features the ISO-AMBIENT ORCHESTRA, a
 group of instrumentalists from numerous local bands and international
 solo projects whose real-time virtual performance is akin to an
 Internet-style online experience.  Iso-Ambient Orchestra members
 include: Joe Gore; Chris Muir; Michael Belfer (Torcher); Anton
 Newcombe (Brian Jonestown Massacre) and Larry LaLonde (Primus) and a
 host of others. 
 
 Later on the same bill is David Darling, solo cellist, whose evocative
 music provides an atmospheric melancholy. Those familiar with his CD
 releases on the ECM and Hearts of Space labels should witness his
 inauguration into the 3D sound field.  Along with this, arrives the
 Acid Karaoke of Carl Stone and oriental singer Mien Xiao-Fen.  Stone is
 an internationally-known electronic music composer who has traveled
 extensively and released many wild and whimsical works for New Albion
 and other labels.  His music, in combination with Mien Xiao-Fen's
 exotic vocals, should transform the event into a department-store
 frenzy.

 DJs for the night are not your usual fare: ethnic/world specialist
 Cheb i Sabbah will create a multilayered tribal/space mix; Jonah
 Sharpe is back from England with a fresh new collection of tracks; and
 debuting on "digital transport" will be the creator, co-ordinator and
 curator of Sound Traffic Control, Naut Humon. The Drones begin at 9
 p.m., tickets are $6.

 Friday's RE-IMMERSION, presented in conjunction with Ambient Jungle,
 adds a festive element to the occasion. Appearing with STC will be
 Spacetime Continuum, a techno-ambient convergence from the Astralwerks
 label guided by Jonah Sharpe, whose aural exploits include
 collaborations with Bill Laswell, Peter Namlook and Deep Space
 Network. The evening's lift-off will be provided by Reflective
 Records' Single Cell Orchestra, who explore the mysterious underside
 of the ambient phenomenon through chromatic transpositions and
 narrative form. For those who continue to dance, DJs Mark Farina,
 Thomas and Felix will spin atypical house- and techno-beats in the
 Dubzone. Macross Vision by Hyperdelic will fill the Dubzone with
 synaesthetic color and light. Doors open at midnight, tickets are $10.

 On both nights, the 3D sonic habitat will be punctuated by Perry
 Hoberman's "Symphonic Appliance System," which animates a garage-sale
 full of household gadgets including projectors, radios, records and
 electric tools in an audio/visual atomic-age setting.

 The Audio Engineering Society (AES) convention for pro audio gearheads
 at San Francisco's Moscone Convention Center will run concurrently
 with the shows, so anyone looking for a futuristic sampling of audio
 technology outside the convention site need look no further. Sound
 Traffic Control uses a Level Control System from LCS, Inc. that sends
 multiple Macintosh digital audio workstation outputs live to discreet
 DSP mixer posts which are then forwarded to a 3D loudspeaker diffusion
 matrix.

 Hi. how are you? Are you selling any records?
 How much do you want for True Faith? (used to love it, but lost it!).
 I think I might be interested in your House of Venus: Dish and tell, but 
I'm not sure if its one of my friends record
 or a one I wrote in my book of "must have" records ( where I write down 
"cheesy" tunes I dont have myself).
 Im looking for some new acapella records, especially on cd. Do you know of 
any? 
 Its really frustrating being stuck here in Reykjavik and not being able to 
find the music im looking for.
 The only store thats selling 12s here is mainly selling Hi-nrg Italian 
House!!! . 
 I'm hoping to find someone (on the net) that appreciates good dance music 
and has a similar taste in music. 
 The only thing he would do is inform me (through e-mail) on some good tunes 
he has heard or heard about. 
 Then I can order them through mail order.  
 Maybe you can help?    ...Maybe not?       .
 If you want to,  please send me information on what music you like, 
favorite tracks, djs or whatever. .
 Thanks.

                                             Have a nice day... Ymir.

 P.S. Have you heard a track called  "Colgattha" by Cygnus loop?

gawd, not another deadhead endorsement... :)

  i personally haven't readit, but you should check out the book by
    Mickey Hart, "Drumming at the Edge of Magic", in which he describes
      how indigenous cultures all over the world design, make, and play
        drums, both for ceremonial purposes and just jammin'.
   it even gets into how native americans selected and sacrificed animals
     when a drum with skins was required; very nasty stuff...

seeya!

What is amylen nitrate? what is it made of, where does it come from, what
does it do, does it trash you out like speed?

Also, someone told me nexus was an herbal snort, i've never come across it,
so what can anyone tell me about that? hat's the experience like, as well
as the crash?

oh yeah, what happened to the elmo conspired inundation of sf with cloud
nine? I've only seen it being sold at maybe 3 raves this year, with few
takers, altho the cops checked it out (is this legal, sir?). I've had mixed
reviews, but never tried it, tho I heard its just an herbal source of
ephedrine. 

tell me more! tell me more? tell me more!

 Firstly, I wouldn't describe it as a rave, 
at least not in the traditional English sense (continuous fast techno, 
flashing lights, lots of amylen nitrate and E).

?Mijos, did anyone out there go to the full moon?

I couldn't get my motivation up, bumming rides and waking up at 1 am to
call, after being jerked off these last few months, so that's 3 in a row
that i've been denied (or, shall i say, I denied them?).

So, to back up Ken stuart's query, yeah, how have the last two been? It's a
small but significant sign that allen couldn't find "his own" party last
month! Has the lack of accessability made people less enthusiastic,  or has
it made people extremely happy to feel that they have accomplished a great
deed in finding it? How does that little cloud of love that hovers over
smiling, dancing people look? Is it a light fog, or that really funky,
thick thing that you remember  forever and go "oh yesssssssssssss" as you
roll your eyes?

With a party like sunset every weekend, tho, my vibe reservoir runneth
over. Galen, I wish I had a farm by the bay,to give you a permanent
space...

Lotsa love, and if any sfraver wins the lottery, BUY SOME PARTY LAND!

     Since no one has posted anything about the fmr, I thought I'd be the
first one to get it on =)  The site was beee-u-ti-full!  As we drove down the
cliff we could see the moon casting an silver reflection on the water, along
with the massive Goat Rock .  A few minutes after we got there, apparently
there were some sound problems and left stack of speakers were down.  To me,
it felt like that the party never really started  (did I just miss out, or am
I correct?).  Garth let some record spin for what seemed like an eternity
while the problems were being fixed.  Soon enough, the cops decided to shut
it down because of noise complaints.  
     Although, momentum never gathered, the vibe was definitely there!  That
was the first fmr, I had been to since one last year at Bonny Doon, and
everyone was so friendly--except one particular girl I introduced to a friend
of mine who was experiencing his first rave.  She held out her hand to shake
his, when I told her he was a newbie, she withdrew her hand and gave him a
dirty look!  Its that kind of shit that pisses me off.  Don't we want people
to see what raves are really about?  Its that kind of attitude that helps
perpetuates the negative stereotype.  
     Other than her, everyone else I introduced Matt to was very receptive
and glad he was there.  I really enjoyed meeting all the people and seeing
familiar faces again.  David (?)from Oakland, and many others whom I'm not
sure of their names but you helped make the three hour drive for us worth
while.
rave on,
Brian

Mijos, just needed to say that it was so refreshing to do some camping with
you! Tents were unnecessary, toatl tweakin population can sleep no more,
but what joy to be beached with all you love seals around that fire...was
that Einstein talkin' in that ambient set? I couldn't ground my mind too
well during that part, but "dis poem" made my night. 

Ah, a chance to do something healthy for myself! Got a tan, did the river,
watched my scrotum shrink to unbelievably small dimensions upon immersion,
and see the diference between a "raver" party (picking up trash) and a
pickup party (drive to the river, drink your budweiz, leave your trash). Me
an Dave spent four hours coming down by canoe, getting 5 bags and hiting 30
or so trees (damn hard to steer those things). As an entomologist, I was
dissapointed by the lack of mosquito, blackfly and tick bites, they are
great conversation starters ("you know, that female needs your blood to
make her babies. Here, let me show you how it pierces your skin"). But hey,
at least i didn't have to stink of DEET or Off!

Too bad the directions confusion made some people stay in sf, but I think
we were pretty close to max capacity,and wow, how do ravers keep those
bathrooms so clean? Could have something to do with respect? Consideration?
Hmmmmmyeah, could beee! 


Lotsa love, maintain yer tans,

Hello sfravers!
I'm a nw-raver and this is my very first post (i think :) ) to sf!
yaaaaay!

Anyway, let me say that I can feel the vibe you folks have down there
all the way up here!  I'm jealous and I wanna come down there!

HOWEVER, I am unfortunately posting because I feel motivated to respond
to the post about the rude girl at your fmr (sorry I forgot who posted).

I agree that this type of negative energy has NO PLACE in the 
underground universe.  Isn't the reason we escape to the underground
to avoid that type of shit and promote LOVE and ACCEPTANCE?!?!

True, there are some closed-minded people who should not be going
to raves, but if someone really wants to check it out, they should
be welcomed warmly.  AAAAAaaaaaa !!!!!  I HATE THAT SHIT!!!!!!
Jesus, doesn't that girl remember when she was new??? 
OH. . .maybe she was BORN on the dancefloor.

Seek and destroy this menace.

love, 
eric

	Milton,

	  In rolling stone there was a real good article about nitrates and
	they're link to karposi's sarcoma in aid's patients.  Basically in
	the gay community nitrates are known as poppers.    There has
	been a strong link of people who use nitrates and the occurance
	of sarcoma.  The conclusion was that sarcoma are not a result
	of hiv/aids, but a result of the usage of nitrates.  Sarcoma normally
	occur in men over the age of 50 and are benign, but something
	about the nitrates not only makes them occur at a much earlier
	age, but they are malignant and will ultimately cause death.

	  Basically not great stuff for the long term.  But the effect of
	poppers is that you get a relaxation in your muscles.  Supposedly
	this increases the sensation and intensity of orgasm.  Also
	gay men into the fisting scene use it to relax, well their
	muscle.

	  So from what I understand, do not, and I stress NOT use them
	unless you want to encounter the long term affects.

	Ron.

	Amylen nitrate are 'poppers'. It is a little tube you shove in 
your nose and it makes you high. If I am not mistaken, hey are supposed 
to be used for people we feel like they are fainting. I have inhaled 
through the nice little off-white tube once, but I was waiting for my 
real drug to kick in, so I cannot tell you about it trashing your system 
(Although I would guess it does not, but then it does not keep you up 
like speed, at least the way I had done it)

	Nexus is not an herbal snort. It is not herbal (at least the 
nexus that was going around last fall. I had talked to someone on here 
about it. It is 2-CB which is a psychoactive synethic. I have not tried 
so I cannot tell you from experience what it is like, but it is well 
documented in PIHKAL (alongwith 180 other of your favorite substances, 
many of which are not scheduled - yet.) Furthermore, 2-CB had been legal 
up until mid-Ocotober if I remember correctly. Then it went in your 
favorite category, Schedule 1.....

Hmmmm.... Kinda reminds me of the 'good Dr.' up in Boikley who sez that
AIDS and ARC's are not the result of HIV but the weakening of the human
body when 'stressed' with a combination of anal sex and drugs. In short,
he is an extreme homophobe who has let his views distort his studies. Fuck
him. This is the first I've heard of a link between poppers and Sarcoma.
So I guess I should go read the article when I get some time....

Oh, and ephedrine is derived from the Chinese herb (do herbs have ethnicities?
seems kinda weird.....) Ma Huang. Kinda interesting story involved with its
discovery but will save your lovely eyes from reading it.

But I just got done wid dat midtoim shit and am all out for raving! Yes, I
haven't decided where to go yet but I think I'll hit Megatripolis on Sat.
nite - so if y'all see a skinny long haired asian-ameri. klutz out there
dat homes be me. Also, in a coupla weeks Ralph Abrahams is gonna be speaking
there and he's kinda an interesting  case. He's one of the guys that started
off chaos sci. He finished his doctorate program at Yale(?) and it was the
60's so he tripped for a couple of years, found himself in Santa Cruz getting
into Indian music and watching water drip out of faucets and the rest is
history!

Yeah yeah yeah....

	The short answer to the statement is that the study was not
	homophobe biased.  What the study brought out was that sarcoma
	was found to not occur in anyone except men who used
	'poppers' and there are documented cases of men with
	sarcoma, but not hiv or aids.  Of course this research is
	completely ignored by the centers for disease control which
	infuriates me and in addition the FDA refuses to ban nitrites

The Nexus that I've seen is legal and sold in packs.  If I remember 
right, it was ephedrine (but I'm not sure.)  I do remember Laura writing 
about Nexxus (or was it Cloud 9).

I was listening to my Simon tape today and there is a song on it where 
this guy says "catch it" over and over.  After a minute or two it sounded 
like he was saying "cat shit" and hearing that being chanted with such 
cool rhythms was really funny :)

Hi everyone!  Lorien here with Pacific's party calendar:

Sunday, October 23:  Sunset (no, Sunset hasn't ended, yet...)
Tel: (415)985-5264

Saturday, October 29:  Funky Tekno Tribe: "Sunset Ambient Village by 
Pacific Sound System" (we get to do a chillin' groovy indoor room, yhea!)
Tel: (415)266-8215 or (415)267-6129

Sunday, October 30:  Sunset Finale (we'll set up straight after FTT ends 
and jam till sundown for the last time this year)
Tel: (415)985-5264 (next week)

Excellent.  Looks like Halloween is gonna kick!  And this Sunday should

Also, we are starting a mailing list for info on future Pacific 
productions, so if you want to be on it send your name and address to 
[helagon@well.sf.ca.us] or call the vmail and use your (cough!) voice.

Thanks to all of you who made it to the River last week.  It was 
completely excellent.  You all made the experience; as always, in your 
different ways.  It was the best camping lurk yet.  Thanks Mark and Tracy!

Love, expression, consideration -Lorien

Not to be too picky, but I would like to add to this...
Kaposi's Sarcoma was predominantly a disease of Eastern 
European/Mediterranean men in their later years.

I would like to know who has "proof" that poppers, in and of themselves, 
cause KS. As far as I know, poppers are believed to be a correlated risk 
factor, not a direct cause. (feel free to correct me if there is some *new* 
study out that says differently.

Plus, if poppers were _the sole cause_ of KS, you'd see a lot more folks 
walking around with KS lesions. They do tend to pop up on one's face.

Amyl and butyl nitrate are also vasodilators -- they expand blood vessels.
That would account for the rush. And a heavy rush will do a lot to relax 
the muscles in the rectum.

Same goes for the quasi-legal inhalants, which are just about as bad.

I'd also like to point out that anal sex is the riskiest sexual practice, 
but one that is performed by hets as well. So where are all the women 
with KS?

> 	Ron.

This is not a flame, BTW. I just want to know what's being said out there 
in the "real world". Especially if it's new stuff that I should know. 
(like if someone manages to *prove* that HIV causes AIDS)

Now you know why Susan & I hate tons of vocal samples ;) I mean, how many 
times can you hear "house music all night long" etc. before madness or

now the moon is waning and so i switched my sun & moon pendant over to
the moon side.  pretty soon the new moon will be here...will there be
a new moon party?  not sure not sure  

you can bet the vibe will be great if there is one!  introductions all
around and plenty of phat music from the greats, maybe...like tracy?
galen? bryce & his italian lessons?

i'm so sorry the full moon party got busted up at goat rock.  well,
maybe some of you remember that the new moon party got there FIRST
('cept for the surfers & happy sunbathers, of course..) way back in
June, when Glen and Heather proclaimed their love under the stars.
that was a magical night..today i listened to galen's set on my car
radio & jammd into work feeling fabulous.  that night galen played
for FIVE hours.  can you believe it?  he is the IRON DJ.  

maybe the full moon (the new moon's phat sister..) wouldn't keep

	60 miles above the Golden Gate bridge?!  I exclaimed.
	It's no further from the City than Bonnie Doon, Markie replied.

	(I live in Mountain View and Bonnie Doon is only about 50
	miles away from me.)  The plan was to have the sound system crew
	at the site by 11 pm and set up so that when people started to
	arrive by 2 everything would be set (yeah right).

	I got to the River road exit on 101 at about 0200 thinking I was
	terribly late, only to discover that I had another 13 miles to go to
	Gurnerville, when I got to Gurnerville the coast weas another 23 miles
	away!! and the roads were twisty! Shit.  Still you gotta have devotion.

	When I did arrive at the site, it was indeed absolutely beautiful.
	Definitely one of, if not the most beautiful FMR sites ever. I drive
	the last mile with the windows open, listening for the thump, thump,
	thump of bass bins, but all I hear is the crashing waves and the
	most beautiful moonlight reflecting on the surf.  There are several
	MASSIVE rocks off shore and one extremely huge rock (The Goat Rock?)
	at the beach itself, but still no sign of the party, was I too late?
	Had it been busted already? I round the last bend and right before me 
	is a yellow rental truck with huge generator in tow.  It's about
	0245 and they are just getting here as well!  We park everything
	and begin to set up. It is _very_ cold (by california standards) i 
	would guess in the mid to high fourties with about a 10 - 15 knot wind 
	out of the southwest that will be a problem for the DJ. Still we get
	the system hooked up and Garth drops the first beat at around 0330.

	The Purple People Pusher excells in outdoor situatuions like this,
	the sheer amount of clean sonic energy it can deliver in outdoor 
	settings can only be described as _otherworldly_.  It's as if you
	asked the folks from Zeta Reticuli to build a system for Homo Sapien
	Reprogramming (like a PROMM burner for Humans). I was parked about 75
	meters away in my car (a CRX) and the BASS was actually causing the
	body to vibrate and sway a little, (shit, talk about PHAT!)

	Dancing under the stars and moon and surf, is a perfect way to recharge
	ones batteries. And Garth took us out of the space dock with expert
	precision,  he built momentum as we did our pre-flight check, all 
	systems were go, this was gonna be a killer trip, and then...
	a ranger shows up.  She says that she got a complaint from some
	houses several miles down the coast she points in the general southern
	direction that the speakers were pointed in.  She was actually
	quite mellow about the whole thing, she says that we need to turn it 
	down.  And that she's gonna go up to the top of the hill and if the 
	sound level is low then we can proceed, else we gotta turn it off,
	OK fair enough, Garth plays some quieter grooves, we cruise along on
	impulse power, and wait.  The sound guys reconfigure the system
	to deliver lower power and to a smaller dispersion pattern.  I notice
	that she swings by about 20 minutes or so later but doesn't stop.
	(I guess we passed the test!) So the party criuses along until Markie
	takes the decks, I guess he decides to not wait for dawn and make
	the jump to light speed now. I was in my car getting warm with a friend
	and we hear/feel the thump, Thump,THUMP. I think OH shit, It's Markie,
	he's goin for it. Sure enough about 15 minutes later there is silence,
	She says "What happened?" I say "I think the party's over :)"
	Sure enough, the ranger is back and tells us that we have to stop the
	amplified music. We are welcome to stay on the beach but we can't play 
	the sound system.  Mark Ameba says he knows of a place near by in a 
	redwood grove where we can go, they pack the stuff up and begin a 
	caravan to the site, I have a meeting to attend to at work, I split
	and head for SF.

	The site was indeed absolutely beautiful and most likely with the
	old style sound systems that the FMR used to use there wouldn't be 
	a problem.  It will be hard to find a place around where it can
	really be cranked, I'm sure Burning Man next year will be one such 
	place but memorial day is a long way away and the nights are getting 
	colder, still the search for the perfect, remote, deserted coastal
	beach with access from the road, and parking continues.

a friendly interjection from your safer sex advocate: "unprotected" anal
sex (without some sort of barrier) is a ~high~ risk sexual practice, not
necessarily the riskiest.  The nature of the risk, and to whom the risk
is present varies on the exact nature of the anal sex involved.  it has
been demonstrated that fisting (vaginal or anal) without a barrier presents 
a high risk to the insertive partner (somewhat counterintuitive), while 
penis/anus sex presents a higher risk to the recipient.  Note that this 
"risk assessment" is largely in the context of HIV.  Various other kinds 
of STDs can be contracted, on an equal basis, by either partner.  The 
highest risk sexual practice I can imagine is sharing blood or blood products 
in some way, shape, or form (hence the general concern for folks who share 
needles used for injecting IV drugs of whatever kind).

Barriers (condoms, dental dams, vinyl gloves, saran wrap, finger cots,
stubbies) dramatically reduce the probability of transmission of STDs,
including HIV, regardless of the sexual activity one engages in.  

Learn to love latex!  Don't share works (or at least clean them properly)!
Know your partner (get that phone number for later reference)! Know your
own body! Be informed, and make informed, conscious choices about the
risks you choose to take.

Nexus isn't guaranteed to be anything. People selling it have claimed
several things. Some say it's a derivitave of the khat plant. One says
it's "brominated cathinone". All the samples Shulgin looked at turned
out to be 2CB.

Chances are, if it's being sold openly, it's probably some junk mix of
ephedra and other legals. You'll probably have a lot more fun buying a
bottle of "Brain Wash" soda :).

If it's being sold discreetly as a white powder in gel-caps, then it's
probably 2CB. Beware: 2CB can be powefully disassociative at highter
doses. Use with the usual care.

Amyl Nitrate linked with sarcoma in AIDS patients? Are there any other
studies on this or any technical critiques of the study? Basing such
an important conclusion on one study seems awfully premature.  What
other work is being done on this possible link.

	Basically to wrap it all up, the study while not being exhaustive found
	that men who used poppers ended up with KS while men who did not
	use poppers did not.  In addition there was no correlation of the
	occurance of KS with AIDS.  In other words men with KS did not have
	AIDS or test positive for HIV.  The whole write-up was in SPIN (I had
	previously stated rolling stone).  The study results was being made
	public by a gay group to bring up the awareness of the public
	to the danger.  While I don't think that they study guaranteed that
	KS would be brought on by the use of poppers,  I do beleive it
	pointed out that it could in fact be a factor in wether or not you
	could contract it.  The interesting thing about the results also was
	that anywere the nitrate was used on the body KS was more likely
	to appear (i.e. the face).  As you pointed out KS may be a male
	related disease only and that may be why we don't really see any
	women with this disease.

	What I was mostly trying to point out was there has been information
	for some time that nitrates could lead to health problems that lead
	to death.  Whenever I consider a substance for consumption I like
	to know as much info about it as possible before consuming it.

	Ron.

     funny some one should say something about nexus!  I was talking to a

sorta like E.  She said that its good to take it with E because it enhances
the high quite a bit.  I asked her if it was like talking 2 E but she said it
was different than that.  My question is, what is it?  E is mdma, doses are
LSD, pot is pot.  What is nexus made of?  That makes me nervous that I may

hours for it to kick in, and it will cause a quicker effect if snorted (not

actually, there have been ongoing studies about AIDS co-factors...the
use of inhalants is one of them.  

There is a bit of discussion in the medical community concerning the meaning
of the relationship of inhalant use and contraction of AIDS, or at least
sero-conversion to HIV antibody presence.  The use of amyl and related
inhalants was much more prevalent in the '70s and early '80s in the USA
(at least) because 1) they were legal (most nitrates are no longer legal,
and haven't been for years) 2) they were readily available (over the counter
in bookstores) 3) there had been no prior study suggesting they were a cofactor
in AIDS or sero-conversion.  When they were criminalized, driven onto the
black market, and the initial study released, use of nitrates dropped
dramatically in the USA.

In the context of the initial study, at that time, LOTS of things were
suggested as cofactors for AIDS or sero-conversion...including being Haitian
(hence a button i wore for years claimed i was a "Bisexual Haitian Junkie"...
these were all considered, at the time, indicators of one's risk of infection).
the point is that the available study group at the time was largely European
and US gay males, who had a "somewhat" homegenous culture and practice at
the time.  As we know now, this is no longer (and really, NEVER was) the
case.  The sample size these days, is, regrettably, huge, and very diverse.

There was a very lively discussion of the study in mention at the time. It
was not conclusively shown to be bogus, but is regarded with some reservations.

It is also important to remember, vis a vis Kaposi's Sarcoma, that the 
incidence/morbidity rate for KS has dropped dramatically since the early
'80s, in most of the developed world (though not in AFrica and significant
portions of Asia).  This is largely because the medical community has done
its research on effective treatments, and now properly treats KS.  It still
occurs (too often, sadly), but is not as life-threatening (by itself) as it
used to be.

There has been little new news released on AIDS cofactors in the past few
years.  Most research money has been dedicated to treatment, the search
for an inoculation, and for understanding the molecular biochemistry of
HIV.  Studies are ongoing, however.  

For more information, an introductory text on the early history of the
disease in the US and Europe is Randy Shilts' _The Band Played On_ (the
book, please), though his history is somewhat flawed.  Current news can
be obtained in the periodicals _The Body Positive_ and _BETA_, which
are available in many larger cities.  There are frequent articles in the
_New England Journal of Medicine_ and _Lancet_.  It is also very likely
that most libraries have materials available, at various reading levels.
Consult your librarian or bookseller.  There is also likely to be an AIDS
hotline in your area...the folks on the line should be able to point you
toward a local source of information.

ObRave: Informed choices in use of substances and one's sexual activities
is very important.  Reasonable guidelines suggest that one should be
possessed of normal consciousness when engaging in sexual activity, or
at least to be aware of risks.  One should also choose the level and kind
of risks one is comfortable with, and have appropriate knowledge of how to
play safely, and to have the necessary implements (latex in all its forms,
bleach, etc.) at hand.   PLUR is wonderful, and we can all have a safe and fun
time with our rave friends.  I'd like you all to be around for a long time.
Play and travel safe!

SPIN Magazine usually has an article relating with AIDS in it.  Last 
month's or this month's talks about Amyl Nitrate and KS.

	Bryce,

	  Nitrates in certain formulations are illegal, but nitrate companies
	have reformulated nitrates so that they pass the FDA regulations,
	and are now marketing them again under a new guise.  You can
	pick them up from you local leather store as "leather cleaner" and
	they are being heavily advertised in different leather magazines.
	So the general outrage is that their is some info, whether it is
	conclusive or not that nitrates are a problem, but yet they are
	remerging and a new generation of consumers are buying them
	without the knowledge.

	  I totally agree with you about informed consumption, and I really
	want all of you to be around for a long time.  I want to have everyone
	around when I am old and grey to rave with :-)

	Ron.

By far the worst one was from a song Eddie Richards used to play a
lot; he even played it at the Wired party last year, the sample was
"Beat her with a bat", over and over, Absolutely HORRID. 

Favorite vocal samples:
I don't know the names of the songs, but they were very popular a year
ago:

"We've got to come together."

and that crowd pleaser that goes..

"Music, music, music, music...!"

And sorry, but I *still* like "House Music all nite long." :)

These days, my favorite vocal samples are amongst the more tribal/ethnic
music (Richard Kirk, Banco De Gaia, Loop Guru) I've been listening to.
Not in english, but I'm sure they are all saying something cool. ;)

Mijo, if amylen nitrate relaxes your muscles, why do 'em at a rave? Sounds
like wobbly legs (to the point of fisting!) would get in the way of getting
down....

BTW, is this the stuff hunter thompson (Dr. Gonzo) had a fake heart
condition so he could pop them, in "fear and loathing in las vegas"? Damn
good book, lots to do with personal freedoms, drugs, samoan lawyers etc...

Hey Lorien-

Nice to see you guys keep going strong. 

I'd be interested in playing an ambient/dub-trance set at one of these 
events.

Cyril has one of my tapes and I can get you and Galen one if you like.

Will C-YA soon,
Ronan

Well, since I was mentioned in two different posts this week, I thought 
I'd say hi.  I had fun demoing my computer at Megatripolis last week, and 
I hope to bring it back Saturday.  The WWW browser mention below was 
"Mosilla", actually Netscape Mosaic, so named because their mascot is a 
dinosaur (I don't know the story behind that).  Its free by ftp, I 
highly recommend it. I also demonstrated  
a 3D virtual reality interface to the Web. It's brand new, and should be 
publicly available in a couple of weeks. Software was 
contributed by Mark Pesce of Interspace (I think).  A thank you to them. 

As for the nitrite/nexxus controversy, check the hyperreal.com archives, 
you should find all the information you need there.  Don't trust anyone's 
net.opinion.

As for the Rave mass, one need look no further than African-American 
churches for inspiration.  From what I hear from people I know, they have 
quite elaborate productions as well as music.  House music is very close 
to gospel, and there is a lot of house music with spiritual lyrics.  The 
Sheffield paradigm is also intriguing, but a mixture of trance and house 
would be fantastic.  A good rave will contain elements of both cultures.

Making the record store rounds last weekend, I heard not one but TWO
new songs with "Get down to the funky beat!" ARRRGH! And this other
despicable piece of vinyl had (I kid you not) the guitar lick sampled
from Dire Straits "Money for Nothing". After that, I felt kind of
unclean :).

Well, at least I can understand get down to the funky beat. I never
understood "Come on!" Am I being chided to dance, or dance harder? Or
is he speaking to "the band", telling them to pick it up a bit? "Come
on" and mix this song out? :)

Is it ironic if there's no melody playing when the man is singing
"Music music music music music..."?

Is there any "Hi-NRG" out there with a harder edge and no goofy
choruses?

Any cure for DJ disease?

What you just said, Bryce, is what I would have (and partly did) say. 
Thanx for your post.

The reason I said that anal sex was "the riskiest" is because it is the 
easiest method of HIV transmission. The tissues of the rectum are 
delicate and can become torn easily.

I had no idea, however, that the fister was more at risk than the fistee!
Learn something new every day...

I believe in safer sex; I used to give away condoms at the clubs I went to.
Unfortunately, I can't learn to love latex; I'm *very* allergic to it. I 
can't even have it on my *hands* for long, let alone put my mouth on it. 

That is one of the reasons I had to stop working at Mr.S Leathers... to 
dye leather, latex gloves are essential.

Forgive me for not going into the detail that you did -- I was extremely 
tired. I was also expecting to be flamed by folks yelling "OFF TOPIC!", 
and I wasn't sure if I would be stepping on someone's toes by the whole 
subject -- as I'm pretty new to the list, I don't know how much safer sex 
has been discussed herein.

But anyway, thank you for your concise posting. It is very much 
appreciated. I think I'll file it for later use :)

I may be wrong, and this may be a completely different song, but i 
remember a track with the vocal sample 'I'll beat that bitch with a bat' 
over and over. and, truthfully, aside from the decidely un-pc 
sentence..the rhythm of that sentence over and over again made for a very 
funky track. flame away. :)

Christ! Like we need more of *that* in the world  |-P

That's similar to the reason Susan got rid of that Nation 12". It sounded 
too much like homies killin' homies. She'd _much_ rather see them kill 
Jesse Helms, Strom Thurmond, Ronald Reagan.... in fact, she'd drive the 
getaway vehicle.

*I would really like to see this good drug/bad drug thang go away!* I for 
one could easily picture chilling out on smack in the ambient room, and 
then going on the floor to dance when I wasn't high anymore. That's not 
to say I do or would now, but I must say I'd rather take care of someone 
on the nod than someone freaking on psychoactives for the next 8 hours...

That must have been taken from the Fat Boys' song, Human Beat Box, Part II. 
The album was "The Fat Boys Are Back."  A comical, mostly accapella, jaunt into

"Listen to the Drummer" by Nation 12.  It's on an old Rhythm King compilation
called "Beat This" (not to be confused with a different Rhythm King compilation
called "Beat Dis").  I found a CD of "Beat This" in Rasputin's used CD section 
a while back.  Both "Beat Dis" and "Beat This" feature old house classics from
the likes of Bomb the Bass and S-Express.

> Remember "bass line kickin' yes I'm groovin'............bass line 
> kickin'    bass line kickin'"  
That's "Londres Strut" by Smells Like Heaven (and it's on the Cowboy Records 
double-CD compilation).

Nation 12, "Remember".

The good track is the B-side, "Listen to the Drummer". Susan must have
sold hers, because I bought mine at Primal. Funny thing is, I never
would have associated the sample with any sort of violence had Susan
not explained what it's sampled from. I wonder how many partygoers are
the same? (Out of context, that sample could be about football or
someone with lots of post-it notes...)

If a sample--even from a nasty source--is sufficiently vague or out of
context, then it won't disturb my sensibilities.  I'm not into hate
and violence, and my records reflect that. I like songs that are fun
and that make my butt move :).

There is room, however, once in a while, for anger and a
non-destructive channeling of that dark energy and frustration that
builds inside us.  Sometimes what I want to evoke is an overwhelming
insane sick dark energy primal scream mindfuck dance into oblivion.

Who said purification couldn't be fun? :)

Hi. I'm looking for a ride up to Megatripolis this Saturday. If anyone
in the Santa Cruz area has empty space and can help out a poor,
carless individual who desperately needs to dance, your assistance
would be welcomed. I can help with gas, etc. I can be reached by email
or at 426-3265. Thanks.

[re: Geoff White talks about Full Moon and the shut down by Ms. Ranger]

I was wondering where the system was set up in relation to the parking
lot up at Goat Rock.  From what I recall of the New Moon so long ago was
that it was over a mile down along the beach.  I remember Ms. Ranger
discovering the party way into the morning and being totally cool about
it.  One thing about the beach a mile down is there is a huge cliff face
that has got to do something about keeping the sound down at sea level.
I don't know why there hasn't been another new moon at that site again,
but I sure wish there was.

Ciao,

Purple Tiger

Hi, a couple friends of mine, Owen and Mark will be at Megatripolis
showing off Mozilla, Mosaic Communications New Product, and some sort
of 3D interface to the net.  Stop by and say hello.

Owen might also do a techno pagan rap across the street that night
too.  Next week Network Zero is doing a cyber-Samhain ceremony so
if your interested, email me and I'll hook you in to the info.

An, of course, I'll be there all night, the guy in purple.  Say
hello.

> *I would really like to see this good drug/bad drug thang go away!* I for 


Hey, i could care less what drugs you do, until it affects *me*...now, 
i'm coming from a strictly east coast point of view...but i've been to 
enough parties where only half the people are dancing and the other half 
are on the floor drooling because they've fallen into a K hole. I *kills* 
the vibe, obliterates it, and really has no place, as far as i'm 
concerned, in this scene. the good drug/bad drug thing, for me, is based 
on the risk taken when taking these drugs. you can be safe with E or 
acid, when you know the dealer and have seen people on the same 
stuff..but with smack, who knows? it's too risky. (as an aside, a very 
good friend who just did not get the fucking picture recently od'd after 
repeated wake-up calls. )
the bottom line is, i like to go to raves/parties where there are alot of 
smiling happy friendly people there having a good time, not numbed-up 
zombies.

 Tomorrow night Sat 22nd the Cacophony Society (same folks who do Burning
 Man and other delectible delights) are putting on "Kill Your TV". The
 event featuring Shark Bait and many, many soon to be very dead TV's, will
 begin at 9:00 in a location behind 3rd & Marin ( China Basin area ? ).
 Admission is $5 ( I think ) and it might prove to be an interesting
 kick off to the evening or to smash a TV or to cheer on the smashing...
 They promise that many TV's will meet their doom in various diabolical
 ways...

 I'm going to be there with another friend to video the event and just
 thought I'd pass along the event info.

Sounds great--too bad I'm spinning at Komotion that night. If you're
looking for a cool party on your way back up 3rd Street, Komotion should be
going till at least 2am. 3 DJs, 3 bucks, all ages, all proceeds benefit
Lyon-Martin's queer youth mentoring program.

If interested, check my .sig for the address or ask someone who went to the
last Friends & Family...

Please take my advice and DO NOT USE THIS SHIT!  When I was a kid I became
very addicted to the crap and ended up trashing my immune system (as it
breaks it down) suffered extreme physical and mental breakdowns from it and
was pretty much bed ridden for over 6 months.  I though it was really kewl at
the time but of all the stuff I've put in my body, I can truly say I wish I'd
never have touched the shit.  Years later now, with a reasonably clean mind,
I have gone back to school and have noticed the effects of its use and think
I really suffered from it.  I know it is legal in many states, but if you
really think about it, and what is happening when you do the stuff I think
you'll understand.  I feel very, very strongly against these and very rarely
makes posts, but I couldn't help making one on this subject.  Thanks for your
time!

	If there is causal link between nitrates and AIDS, one might find 
it worthwhile looking to the UK cuz there is a LOT more substances with

 The system was set up facing south in the parking lot.  It was on the right
side of the lot.  All the cars were parked along the perimeter of the lot.
 The wind was blowing the same direction the sound was, so the people living
down a ways must have waken up to bootie shakin' grooves instead of the
traffic report on KGO or something.  Complaining?  I'd rather wake-up with
window rattling music than a cup of Folger's Crystals any day!  Sheesh!

[re: Geoff White talks about Full Moon and the shut down by Ms. Ranger]

I was wondering where the system was set up in relation to the parking
lot up at Goat Rock.  From what I recall of the New Moon so long ago was
that it was over a mile down along the beach.  I remember Ms. Ranger
discovering the party way into the morning and being totally cool about
it.  One thing about the beach a mile down is there is a huge cliff face
that has got to do something about keeping the sound down at sea level.
I don't know why there hasn't been another new moon at that site again,
but I sure wish there was.

Ciao,

Purple Tiger

I'm sure that if the sound system were smaller and not as loud, we would
have most likely completed the party without being discovered.
More Judicious placement of the speakers would have helped as well,
(like pointing out towards the open sea, maybe the dolphins can appreciate
acid house more then some of their cousins :).
The ranger WAS very nice with us and no one gave her any attitude, even
when she came back, no one was rude.  (she must have felt safe, she was
alone on both trips and didn't feel the need for police assistance or
anything, even though there were over 150 people there.

Milton & E-Bee,
You haven't missed much by not experience Cloud 9.  I tried it once.  Seemed
like a mix of ephedrine and caffeine to me.  Buzz was similar to LOW-grade
Coke.  (I regret I can make that reference.  Talk about a vibe-less drug...)
Day after trying Cloud 9, I felt like I'd been up all nite getting my butt kicked by Mike Tyson, and I was drained emotionally,
as well.  Save your money...

Another wooley argement about legalization.  Heroin is a fucked-up drug, 
make no mistake about that.  I know people who have got addicted after 
one hit in just te same way that I have known poeple to get addicted to 
ciggerettes after just one pack.
By saying what you are saying you ared oing what our opponants do which 
is to lump all drugs into one catogory where it is either all illegal or 
all legal.  Crack, heroin and cocaine mess you up and are to dangerious 
to be taken by the general poulance on a regular basis.  Pot, LSD and E 
on the other hand are very safe drugs which have a positive effect on 
large groups of people and they should be the ones who are legalized.
It is very easy to make sweeping statements but it only really has the 
effect of causing ignorance which are opponants feed off and use as an 
excuse to justify there arguments.
In short, subtlety and depth of perception is what you really need.

Ephedrine is really dumb
Rush was popular when I went to high school
So was swilling bottles of cough syrup (Robo)

Take a 1/2 coconut shell with a hole punched in the top
out to a pasture and plop it down on a big smelly pile
of cow dung.  Inhalants.  There's a nice high.

Heroin is supposed to be *really* fun.       
Isn't that obvious?

Here are the directions for the free party tonight:

Get to the 580 West towards Richmond (so cross the Bay Bridge if you're
coming from SF) Exit Castro St., which is the last exit before the Richmond
bridge. Turn right on Castro and follow it for awhile. It will curve to the
right and turn into Richmond Pkwy after awhile. Stay on this and turn right
on Parr. (I think you have to turn ithr right or left there) Turn left on
Goodrick (it's fairly soon) and left again on Freethy. It's at the end of
Freethy on the left side. Park inside the gate.

We'll get going around 10.

Joe

Yeah, I hear ya on the zombie thang -- but that seems to me to be *(once 
again)* to be a problem with the idiot who came to that party in the 
first place! It's beyond me why anyone would ingest something like K at a 
party.

As for smack, well, once again, that is a people problem. I see no reason 
why a drug dealer, regardless of the drug, must of necessity be 
inherently evil. The most important thing is:
*Know Your Source!*

 People problem indeed !  We need to educate ourselves and simply 
 drawing arbitrary lines like:

  These are the GOOD drugs ....

  But these are the BAD drugs just won't work.

 Human biological variation just will NOT allow it..

 For example: I personally am VERY allergic to alcohol. If I have even
 a very small quantity I get an incredible headache within a very short
 period of time. So much for alcohol being an acceptable drug FOR ME. I
 always let others check their own responses and make their OWN rules
 about it for THEMSELVES - they aren't me. Also, for years ( even tho'
 I'm a chemist ) I didn't know what "crack" really was - I figured it
 must have been something I had NEVER done because I heard all this 
 stuff about "INSTANT ADDITION". Then I learned it was free based coke.
 Oh is that all!!! was my thought since I've done free base several
 times and found it "BORING AS SHIT for the price". Luckily, I never paid
 for it since I was getting it uncut from a dealer when he was turning
 a group of us friends on from his private stash. So for my body the
 quick addiction theory of coke doesn't apply - for others it might.

 And on it goes.

 As far as addictions go:

 How about "addictions" to foods? I know these are not TRUE addictions 
 but I know more people killing themselves with foods that are "heart
 attack on a plate" than are killing themselves with drugs. Of the 7
 chemistry professors at my school 3 have had bypass surgery. Yeah!
 Let's outlaw fats in the diet above 30%. ;-) 


 Bottom line IMHO is: It really should NOT be the providence of ANY
 government to legislate how and why someone treats their body a 
 certain way - especially when they are doing so in private. Laws that
 affect the common good like - not driving while intoxicated I can
 accept since that has a direct impact on others. But I am very tired
 of laws preventing suicides for terminally ill, "un-natural sex acts"
 between conscenting adults, explorations of consciousness altering 
 through drugs etc. These are things that governments in past centuries
 did not worry about ( in general ). 

 So my vote is : Let's have MUCH more of the FREEDOM our country is
 famous for ( at least in the "myths" that our culture expounds ) and
 far, far LESS of the tyranny of a small group of people deciding which
 things are GOOD and which are BAD for everybody else around them.

 'Nuf said!

I just wanted to thank everyone who came to Megatripolis last night... 
saw lots of sfravers, met some *new* sfravers for the first time :)

And the DJ's -- Jen, Laura, Tracey, and Charlotte --- we were so glad to 
have you all spinning in front of the YSH banner :)

It *was* rather odd to have the security people doing their trip in the 
midst of the party; but then, considering what the City gov. is doing to 
the SoMa clubs, it didn't surprise me. They weren't particularly enjoying 
what they were doing, or at least it didn't seem so to me.

It's so ironic -- my last job (and Susan's) was working for a nightclub, 
but it took about 3 weeks for us to make us feel kinda alien if we went 
to them :p ...

Thank all of you who came and participated -- Bryce, Mark Ameba, 
ravnbird, mike (thanx for showing me Netscape), michael clay, cindy and 
greg, shana, Aaron & Jen, Lee Fogel, and all the others that I am leaving 
out 'cause I'm rather tired  |-]

 I don't know what particular events Maui was refering to , but I did see one 
of the security guys buttonhole some guy in the restroom for exchanging money
for something from a little leather bag. Sorta stealth security , as they 
didn't seem to be wearing any staff id badges last night. On the other
hand , the "plainclothes" look is less visually intrusive.

-------------------------------

 I got there fairly early , so I got to hear Jen do her atmospheric thing
to start the evening. She eventually stirred in chunks of dance-rythm 
stuff , gradually moving into total dance music. Interesting.

 The guy DJing upstairs ( anybody know his name? ) started with a mix of
socio-political-philosophical monologues blended with spacy ambient/industrial
music. Kinda LOUD too , which was unfortuate , since some of the only couches 
upstairs were located right in from of one of the speaker stacks.

 A little after Laura took over the turntables downstairs , I crossed the 
street to the "lounge" to listen to a lecture called "Better Sex Through
Chemistry" from a fellow named Dan Joy , the coauthor of a soon-to-be published
book of the same title as the lecture. With the aid of two asisstants named
Cathia and Riana , and the simulataneous projection of a masturbation video
starring his research assistant Leslis Wiston , Mr. Joy presented us with
a very informal lecture. 

 The topic of his lecture was not aphrodisiacs , which act to increase or
initiate libido - his book was devoted to chemicals which enhance the 
body's sexual ability. Some that were mentioned were GHB , bromocryptine ,
dopamine , and yohimbe.

 I got back to the dance floor at the end of Laura's set. I stayed to dance
for about an hour of Tracey's set , then I had to head home. 

 I HAD A GREAT TIME! I don't know if it was a combination of Wizard Smoke (tm)
( more about that smokable in a future post ), some catnaps I was able to get
at a friend's house , or the great music , or the great crowd , or what , but
last night was just RIGHT. Nice trance dancing .

How can you possibly say that LSD should be legalized on the basis of 
it being more dangerous than LSD?! There IS such a thing as a lethal 
dose of LSD. I imagine that the same can be said of E as well. 
Granted, these substances have the POTENTIAL to instigate positive 
mental states, much more so than H or C tho' it is NOT entirely 
impossible to experience positive mental change with the use of 
Heroin, Cocaine, or Crack. I think it probably has a lot to do with 
the reason behind your explorations in the first place...are you 
doing to HIDE from something, or are you doing it to DISCOVER 
something? Are you doing it as an excuse to hurt someone else, or to 
experience a wider spectrum of what "life" means,  being cautious not 
to harm anyone else during your explorations?

I can't believe that you could support the legalization of substances 
that impair judgement so incredibly, yet substances that only impair 
judgement minorly you think should be outlawed entirely. What logic 
allows you to think this way?

Hello,

Well at some point or another, I've tried all of the substances mentioned, 
but recently I encountered the most addictive of all....


PISTACHIO NUTS !


I have a huge pile of empty shells next to me right here... when did I do 
that?  I don't remember eating all those...

Maybe there should be a warning on the label!

dito, I also got to meet more sfravers.  You are all such great, warm
people. Wow :>

It was great to meet you Maui.  Brian Mcknicle??? (I know this is wrong
spelling) you're a very warm, happy person.

Again Bryce *you are an inspiration*, beautiful Laura (I finally got to
hear you spin) your set was everything I expected and more, I loved it.
Overall the music was very good including (Who are you?) upstairs in the
ambient room.

All in all the vibe of the evening was just right.

See you next saturday at F&FIV. :)

I must chime in on this one -- huffing inhalants is EXTREMELY BAD for 
you. These are very nasty petrochemical solvents.

I am hard-pressed to think of anything else that is that bad. (Well, 
AZT, maybe)

"Addiction" is is not a medically justifiable term for this phenomenon.

Where are these folks now? I've never met anyone who has actually said 
that about themselves...

I agree with that to some extent, but that is a *personal* belief. 

I find the mere concept of laws that are supposed to *protect you from 
yourself* utterly appalling. How can anyone tell me what I can and cannot do, 
when it doesn't affect the person or property of another?

 Pot, LSD and E 
> on the other hand are very safe drugs which have a positive effect on 
> large groups of people and they should be the ones who are legalized.

I'll try to remember that, but my short-term memory doesn't seem to work 
anymore ;)   (cough, cough)

Drugs ARE NOT "negative" or "positive". I find that certain people should 
stay away from certain drugs, yes. But I have had good, even rapturous 
experiences with everything I've ever done, (except an accidental PCP dose 
in a joint) and I wouldn't trade those experiences for anything.

I am curious why certain substances are pc or not pc in the "scene" -- 
everyone is like "Ooohh... don't go near meth, oooohh... it's so 
*baaaaad*....

Well, hell, anything is, if you overdo it! That includes E and herb. MDMA 
*is* somewhat neurotoxic, for example. 
And herb, though I think it's a blessing, helps alot of people to never 
get off their butt and *do* something with their life. Herb, like *all* 
drugs, can be used as a place to hide.

And as far as the meth/E/acid thing -- all three of these build up 
tolerance very rapidly. You can keep doing them, but they will cease to 
get you high. 

My personal belief is:  I am an adult. I am responsible for all of my 
decisions. I do not need and do not want Big Brother or any other 
patriarchal construct telling me what I am allowed to do with my mind 
or my body.

<rant mode off>

Thanks for your time |-]

	This is a problem with the people, why they are doing the drug, 
and/or the information upon which they are making the decision to take 
the drug. Addiction to e and pot and happen as fast as addiction to 
herion or coke in the psychological sense which is what I assume you are

your body for a long enough time for a physical dependence to set in. And 
in my opinion, the psychological dependcies/additicions/cravings are much 
harder to initially recongize, and then overcome.

	Making a distinction between safe and unsafe things to put in 
ones body is not a binary distinction (ie, it is not either safe or 
unsafe). Nor are any drugs safe or unsafe. Pot, LSD, and e have nearly as 
many potential negative side effects as coke or herion (nearly and 
especially if one includes e as it has an methamphetamine hanging off the 
benzene ring). Granted the drugs can faciliate attaining different 
states, but who is to judge which are good and which are bad and place 
that over decision on the liberities of other people). The argument that 
cigs and alocohol are legal so pot and e should be too falls away if you 
do not include coke and smack in those to be legalized. 
	In general, it is not the drug itself which needs to be outlawed, 
but instead, it us who need to look at why their is a feeling that the 
drug NEEDS to be outlawed. If it is a question about the potential for 
abuse, then it is not the drug which needs help but the people who 
might/do abuse it. 
	Drugs are a question of personal responsibility, and people need 
a source of information that is reliable. A long time ago, when Leary was 
still in Harvard doing some really good research and had some other 
really good ideas, he spoke of an alternate type of drug education in 
which people were told of the clinical studies, what they seemed to mean, 
how to identify the drugs and the such. He discussed changing the FDA to 
the Food and Drug Advisory, which left the ultimate choice up to the 
individual, where it belongs.

	Drugs impair judgement. This I am not sure I agree with. Maybe 
they impair judgement in reference to the decisions you might come to 
when sober, but does this mean they impair judgement? And what if they 
open your eyes to something you were forgetting when you making decisions 
before. Were previous decisions impaired? Granted some drugs impair your 
ability to make a quick decision, but I do not think that any drug will 
make you decide something that was in you before you were on that drug. 
Whether you allow yourself the excuse of 'I am high/drunk/amped so I need 
not take this and this and this into consideration' or 'I am high/etc so 
I will just do things and not think about what I am doing' is the 
over-riding concern.

	There was a write up on GHB at the university of Megatripolis. I 
kinda looked through it, read a few things that caught my interest. Some 
of it seemed quite interesting, especially the overall conclusion that if 
one does not take a huge dose (being I forget somewhere above 3 teaspoons 
I think, or was that the amount which would cause the negative effects, I 
have forgotten) and do not piggyback it with CNS depressants, you should 
be fine. For more, find a copy of this blue reader.

Ketamine is a completely different thing than "kaht".  The chemical
components found in Kaht are of the phenylethylamine family (same chemical
family as in ecstasy), which are amphetamine-related mild stimulants.
Ketamine is a powerful anaesthetic which, upon their ingestion, deadens the
entire body but leaves your mind conscious (it has been described as an
out-of-body experience).  Basically you lie immobile (on the ground, bed,
whatever) while your mind is completely somewhere else.

Don't take ketamine under the assumption that you're taking a "kaht" based
drug.  The difference between the two will be rather dramatic.

I have been informed that ketamine mixed with a speedball (heroin & coke
injection) is rather popular in certain drug circles.  Ketamine itself was
(or maybe still is?) popular in England, I have heard.

For me, my days of drug excesses are over.  If I could make a suggestion, I
would like to see some threads pointing away from drug-use and perhaps
continuing discussion about some other non-chemical interests of the scene?
Music?  Friendships?  Politics?

...So God brings Clinton, Yeltsin and Bill Gates to his office (OFFICE!?!)
     and says:

  "Men, I've decided to bring an end to the world next Monday - - and
    I want you to go back and tell your people."


  Upon his return to Washington, Clinton holds a press conference and says:
   "People of America, I have good news and bad news. The good news is
     that all these years we've been saying 'one nation under God',
     we've been right -- there IS a God. The bad news is he is destroying
     the world on Monday"....

  Yeltsin makes an announcement to the Russian people and says:
   "Brave comrades, I have bad news and bad news. The first bad news is
     that we've been wrong all these years -- there really is a God.
     The other bad news is he is going to destroy the world on Monday."...

  Bill Gates calls a board meeting of Microsoft and says:
   "I have good news and good news! The first good news is that God called
     a meeting of the three people he thinks are the most imporetant in 
     the world and I was one of them.  The other good news is that OS/2
     stops shipping on Monday!"

Full Moon Madness in Northern Calif
-----------------------------------

  Well,  I'm a little late in reporting on the Full Moon rave,  but as usual,
our faschist authorities have gone above and beyond the call of duty to spoil
our fun.    After getting set up shortly after 3 am,   I finally got to hear
that new WICKED sound system (Probably not at full volume).    It only took
about an hour before the ranger told us to turn it down.    So,  after
adjusting the speaker system to minimize sound in the direction of the
complainer,   the music started to get turned up again.

  Shortly after that,  in less than an hour,  we were told to leave.   Mark,
from Ameba suggested a vacent campground not far away,   so we all wait in our
cars for the sound truck to get loaded,  with the intent of following it to
the new site.    On the way,   we notice that the truck failed to notice the
turnoff,  and was heading out in the wrong direction.    I would estimate about
75 cars in the caravan.     Certainly very noticable.    By this time,  it was
getting daylight (About 6:30 - 7:00 am).    Eventually,  the truck stopped by
the side of the road,   everyone else pulling over,  or just stopping in the
middle of the road.    The early commuters,  heading east were probably very
pissed off,  as  the road was blocked off for about a half hour.

  Eventually,  someday,  the authorities might soon recognize the fact that
by busting a peaceful rave is going to cause MORE safety problems,  then to
let it continue.

  Everyone made a U turn,  and headed back to the turnoff.   The sound truck
continued on to get gas,  then eventually made it to the campground.   The
grounds were an absolutly perfect site.    By about 7:30 or 8am,  the music
continued for about an hour,  until eventually a ranger showed up.    They
were met by the WICKED crew,   but this ranger didn't know how to deal with
our group of people,  so radioed for instructions.    There was a dispute 
about having to pay $2 for parking,  so the WICKED people took up the
collection and continued negotiating with the ranger.

   Eventually,  the head ranger showed up and explained that the music coundn't 
continue for insurance purposes,  and explained the permit process.   So we
decided to stay there all day long (At least until 4 pm.    I got to spend 
a lot of time with Tracy (I met her at the Russian River rave last weekend),
and a few times before that.   We had a great time,  enjoying a perfect
day in this wonderful campground,  hanging out in the woods,   hiking and
schmoozing around.

  Saturday afternoon I spent ALL DAY doing Yoga Thai chi,  and other exercises
to remove a weeks worth of energy blockages after sitting at the computer all
week.    I can't have these blockages running around my body,   sapping my
energy,    especially at a rave.    After all,   I get my energy this way.

   You see,  I just discovered the really neat place not far from where I live,
thats out in this grove of huge redwood trees.  Largely unoccupied,  and
a great place to do yoga and be with nature.   Getting large doses of nature,
yoga,  and thai chi goes a long ways in helping me deal with the city,  raving,
and dancing long hours without getting tired.

  This weekend,  was SCHWA (An underground party),   Megatripolus,  and 
some other unnamed party,  was sheduled.   I volunteered to manage the Internet
room at Mega again.   Hey!!   Whatever happened to that dude who was supposed
to set up the WWW station?    Thanx David,  for saving the day!!   Yay!!  we
had our WWW station.... Later on,  I learned that SCHWA got busted.   BUMMER!!

    This week at Mega,  featured "Your Sisters House" DJ's,   and
it was like OLD TIMES last year.   Yay!...      Laura layed down
the most insane hard acid trance I've heard in a long time.   Having an
over abundance of energy that evening,  I pulled out all the stops,  and
went totally insane,  digging the music to the max,  stopping ONLY to cool
down.    All the "Sisters" did great behind the turntables,  as the music
was pumpin big time.    My only regrets were that 6 am finally came all
to quickly (sigh!).   So after a big breakfast,   I eventually head home
to meet some friends before making it out to Sunset.    I yearn for a rave
that goes well into the next day.  For me,   24 hours of raving is just
about right.   This 8 hour stuff is for the weenies,  and I'm sick of
spending my after rave hours at the EndUp.   You see,   when I'm out
there raving,  I'm a man with a mission.    My mission is to have a big
smile,   have eye contact with people,   get them to smile back,  and
I give them my energy and love.   At the EndUp,  thats  lot harder to do...

   Again,  this weekend,   I stayed awake from Friday morning until Sunday
evening,  and am now so used to it,   that I no longer feel sorta sluggish
on Mondays anymore.    I just get up at the normal time (about 8:30AM)
and I find that I feel really loose,  and have lots of energy in the
morning.    The last time I slept on a weekend,   sometime in early
September,   I find that I don't feel as well when I wake up.   So,
to rid yourself of the Monday blues,   get out there and rave ALL WEEKEND!!!

   Sunset,  this time was at the Berkeley Aquatic park.    By the time
I arrived (4 pm),  the music was going,  and about 150 fine folks were
out there,  having a great time.     Just after sunset,  a cop showed up,
and was met by one of the Sunset folks,   then eventually went away.  WOW!
It DIDN'T get busted?   I learned that we had a whole half hour left to
go.    Solar was behind the tuntables,  and layed down some great housey
trancey tunes.    The music eventually stopped,   but started up again
with one last song.   By that time,  it was totally dark,  so I headed
back to SF to check out that Ambience party at 1190 Folsom.   Learned
that it was starting at 10 pm,   but with it being 8 pm,    I thought
about hanging out at the Endup,   but decided to head back home.

  Next week....  Friends and Family!!    Yay!!  Also Funkey Techno Tribe!!
Holloween special..... Oh goodie!!   I can hardly wait... It will be the 
first time I'll hear Sean spin....

I got there as they were setting up the Ambient Jungle sign on a tree.  
Quite a feat to try to hang that thing on a tree.  I must have gotten 
there a little after the first DJ started.  Great sound system and what I 
thought was good weather.  Not too bright, but occassional spots of 
clouds and wind to cool me down.  

I don't know who the DJs were but I enjoyed them.  The first DJ, played 
some really wonderful music.  Lots of happy sounds.  Even played the 
Moodswings song with the MLK Jr. Speech, but it unfortunately got 
scratched up and didn't get to hear it finished.  I had a giant smile on 
my face as the song played... but dropped to a giant disappointment as 
the song unexpectedly stopped.  

When the second DJ came on, the record that was put on was a fast
breakbeat track.. kinda spacey.  I thought was this the Jungle part of
Ambient Jungle?  But the DJ (completely shaved head, with English (?)
accent, kinda reminded me of Frankie Bones).  As he was playing his 
ambient tracks, he inserted sound bites from the first landing on the 
moon.  He kept the theme going until his set was over.  I had never heard 
this done before and thought it was interesting. 

The third DJ came on and put on a reggae track.  His set (which I didn't 
all of) seemed a bit more dark.  I left around 4 so I don't know what the 
rest of his set sounded like. 

I thought the reason why the DJs played non-ambient tracks in between 
sets was so that people knew it was a diff. DJ.  I honestly wouldn't have 
known it was a different DJ.  I've never hard these DJs before and I'm 
not very trained with ambient to know "styles."

People showed up with wine, cheese, strawberries, bread.. a picnic.  Some
girls were passing out little flowers to everyone, Don & Noah were
drumming to the music.  All sorts of people: cyclers, in-line skaters,
ravers, asian family barbecuing, parents playing ball with their
daughter... a very good mix of people I thought.  Got to meet a new
friends and talk with some old ones.  I had a good time.  Never thought
I'd go to an exclusively 'ambient' event.. but it was free and fun.  No
one played volleyball or frisbee.. but I thank the promoters for having
thought of water and things to do. 

(Didn't make it out to Sunset.. I'm sure it was good.)

His name is Gamal and he used to be part of Phychic TV. He is also 
a great VIDEO artist.

When I saw him I thought he looked like Moonpup and in fact someone said

i must say, this weekend was one of the most fun i've had since moving 
out here...

first, doug mike and i went to joe rice's party...the location was quite 
neat-o...i'm not sure how to describe it...we got there around 
12:30...met troy...made some nice new friends there, but around 1:30 it 
was busted by the police...there were 5 or 6 patrol cars there...a little 
bit much considering how many people were there...maybe 40 or so...
so after that, we were told to head out to the schwa party which i think 
was their unofficial back up site...the vibe there was pretty 
incredible...everyone was very friendly...i very much liked it...
around 5:30 schwa was busted...

so we headed back home, hung out, boogie woogied, went to sleep...woke
up and went to ambient jungle...aj was very nice and mellow, i just love 
this whole sunset/aj/outdoor action :)

see you soon

"Right on, excellent, thank you all who came down and didn't trash the
guard" love to hear that on the wicked line...

Why shouldn't she feel safe? A bunch of people in overalls and smiling and
dancing is not a threat to a sound, peaceful mind. Especially when no glass
objects are to be seen. But yeah, I love it when no-one boos or sez "fok u,
pigz". I'm shure 50% of the time they feel like you did when you were a kid
and had to follow mom's arbitrary orders ("tell your friends to leave!")
and dissapoint your buddies. It must not be fun to bust a party, unless
it's a personal dick  thang/power trip (refer to  oakland/sf cops).

Anyone at antioch's moon can remember how much stronger the party got when
we talked the cops into letting us stay. They loved our getups and I gues
watching girls in skirts at 2 am wasn't so bad for them, either. It shure
wasn't at July's infinity (carlos, garth, dutch..), where the cops actually
got a date (takes all kinds, some people just have a badge fettish). I get
a kick giving stickers to real PEACE officers. 

Lotsa love, 
 Milton and the E-Bee...

ps. Maybe next time, we should have a small snack stand, with cold-cut
sandies and donuts and coffee, and invite them to join us?

I beleive that's "This is our house, and our house music!  I am the
creator!".

You can find part of that on the old M.E.S.H. (ie. Psychic TV) track
"Meet Every Situation Head-on", and Ministry(!!) steals the "I am the
creator!" for one of their tracks.

I'm not sure of the true origin of the sample.  I was at a rave in
Boston (I'm attempting to move to SF in 4-6 weeks, so hopefully I'll
see y'all there) some time ago (Wonderland) where one DJ played a
track that had the whole "house music that Jack built" speech in it,
which has those lines in it.  I think.  I can't quite remember, it was
sort of, uh, a blur.  :-)

A club is first and foremost a place to drink alcohol.
It is sometimes possible to have a good party in a club in spite of this,
but the club environment is less than ideal for a rave.

Parks are great, but....

Of course not.
What's bad is their refusal to issue permits, just because they don't like us.

Please, check and quote your source.  According to all the books I've
read, there is NO LD-50 for acid.  (A drug's "LD-50" refers to the
dosage that consistently causes death in at least 50% of the test
subjects, or so I have been told.  Someone please correct me if I am
sadly mistaken!)

By the way, I'd be VERY wary of mentioning personal drug use over the
net.  The wires do have ears occasionally.  Now, I *do* have a Friend
Of A Friend who tried _____ and HE says........ :-)

Mijos, I received this from a lurker in Petaluma, and thought I should
forward it due to the recent"good drug/bad drug" debate:

Recently, US news and World report ran a series on addictive beer
synergists. It was found that casual and habitual brew chortlers regularly
employed chips, stale popcorn (styrofoam was often sold in pocorn's place
by dubious dealers), pretzels, peanuts, and of course, pistachios, in their
rituals and social gatherings.

Barry Q., a truck driver from Minnesota, destroyed his marriage and
waistline, as well as his fecal texture, due to the "GREEN NUT". The dye
used to redden the shells, when sold at popular outlets such as Sears, has
been implicated in finger staining and may be absorbed directly thru cotton
gloves, latex being the only effective barrier. 

Many claim that peanuts are a softer high, due to the traditional  removal
of the shell. The EPA has also reported that several rivers in NY state are
clogged with the Pist-shells.

Syrian and Turkish contraband of pistachios has fueled a multi-million
dollar war on nuts, which has only resulted in higher street prices,
leading afficionados and addicts alike to lives of petty crimes,
prostitution and pope-abuse.

Although many, such as SF resident Ken R.(all names in the article were
changed), used the nut recreationally at first, at parties, dates or
reunions, the nut has made its way into the backpacks of many attendees of
the so called "rave", where people hide behind the protective shell of the
pistachio, refusing to face their real alimentary and dietary problems.

While many say pistachios contribute to expanding their pallate, and some
claim that the experience helped them appreciate all foods more, it is very
clear that beer drinking is but the first step leading to munchie
addiction. A move to regulate pistachio use, with a 21 and up  chewing age,
may not be the solution. Alternatives such as pocorn and fritos are still
legal, even purchaseable at quicky marts in bags.

Taxing of these products and use of that money to set up weight-loss and
dental clinics, the Clinton administration proposes, would not only
eliminate the street sale of inferior-even dangerous- products, but would
also generate millions in sale taxes.

Already in California, ever at the forefront of American tolerance, an
Amsterdam clause allows the liscensed selling (only) of peanuts and popcorn
at popular, massive gatherings, such as sporting events. The liscensing
eliminated 100% of munchie associated gang activities in Northern
california stadiums.

Just thought I should share this with everyone.....

Mijos, I heard that Marvin the Martian was a break-in SOMA, really close to
Happy Donuts, in warehouse with a dolphin painted above the door.
I know theyve done it here before, no problems except with set up, but this
time, it went like one of those teen movies in the eighties: with top 40
soundtrack, parents on vacation, cars falling into the river, everyone gets
laid, cops break up the party...

This was more serious, if not as equally eventful. Seems a lot of people
got to wear those plastic "handy-ties" and lie belly down on the floor, and
some equipment is now in a SFPD storeroom. Lotsa people bolted and made it
home. The rest, well, it's breaking and entering.....

Maybe that explains why some people were jumpy when the police came by just
to check out yesterday's Sunset.....

I guess break-ins have their risks, I don't know if I want to ever take
it...but hope everyone's ok after that night. 

Lotsa love to all my fellow ravers, 
 Milton and the E-Bee............

That's true. There aren't enough people who have died of an LSD
overdose to create any sort of statistic. The current wisdom estimates
between 40,000 and 100,000 doses.

Medically, LSD is an extraordinarily safe drug, far safer than most
over the counter medicines. Even people who have overdosed so badly as
to depress their vital signs (by thinking a bag of pure LSD was
cocaine) recovered completely both mentally and physically within 48
hours. It's almost impossible to overdose on LSD in blotter form;
you'd have to eat several hundred sheets of blotter paper, and you'd
fill your stomach or visit God before that happened.

LSD can be a very wild ride, though, and the potential user is
cautioned to be fully informed about when it's advisable, what to
expect, and to have someone trustworthy around to guide them.

Sean

PS - Cannabis has a similar safety factor. LD-50 is estimated at
around 40,000 doses. That level of THC is virtually impossible to
attain via the usual methods. To date, there are no documented cases
of death due to overdose.

Continuation of this thread...

        I normally am not the sort who gets on a soapbox and make speeches,
but I definitely am the sort who stays up late watching the news until I
fall asleep. (ABC World News Now... the news show for insomniacs)

        Lately, I have been particularly disturbed by a proposition that is
on the California election ballot, Proposition 187.  This is the
proposition, if passed, that would deny public education and health
services to illegal immigrants.  Governor Pete Wilson has come out strongly
supporting this proposition, making it the cornerstone of his campaign.  If
passed, this proposition may be taken to Supreme Court, as it is currently
unconstitutional to deny illegal aliens schooling and social services.

        This proposition has caused many heated and passionate debates up &
down the state.  Personally, I believe Prop 187 is the start of a trend
that I find very disturbing, and if it is allowed to continue, it will
affect the very core of American society.

        This proposition could be an incredible disaster for law
enforcement, education, and health services for the state, and it will most
likely cost the state untold millions (instead of the "savings" to
taxpayers).  Law enforcement agencies, educators, and state health
officials have come out against the proposition, even well-known
conservative politicians such as Jack Kemp and William Bennet have
described this proposition as a misguided attempt.

        However, the proposition has been enjoying solid support in this
state, as it is backed by powerful conservative elements such as the
Christian right (Pat Buchanan's shock troops), as well as Pete Wilson.  I
believe the reason why the proposition does well in this state is that the
people it hurts the most (Latinos, Asians, children & young people, and
women) vote the least and/or can't vote.  This proposition also indicates a
trend towards growing xenophobic attitudes among our society.

        Can you imagine a schoolteacher having to kick out little
schoolchildren (using skin color as an indicator) and calling the INS on
their parents?  Frightening.

        On some level, it even affects our scene, as a number of our top SF
DJs are of English citizenship... :)  Markie... are you reading?  Sorry if
I got all preachy...

        Please give this Proposition a lot of thought.  I know that sfraves
is a diverse collective of young people who are part of a scene they
passionately care about.  I also hope that we should passionately care
about the diversity of our society as well, and I implore you to take those
passions with you to the ballot box this November.

This "trend" is actually a very old and nasty trend that seems to have an
inherent place in California history. Check out the way 'they' got rid of 
the Spanish Dons to make nice big plantations and shit then bringing in over
Mexicans, Africans, and Asians to do the shit work that you wouldn't see
the people who are saying Immigrants are taking over our jobs doing. Then
when the works just about all done they all try and kick out the strangers,
the  'others'.

And they are calling this an issue? Is it really something that needs to 
be voted on? Where we can vote to keep a kid from getting medical attention
just because he was born somewhere else? I think the real issues are more
like how come we can't afford decent housing or where are the jobs gonna
be in a couple years from now (if this bloated fucked system keeps on going)....

I may be ignorant but i don't think that you can catagorize any drug as
"safe" if it doesn't kill most people. I think turning into a vegitable 
becuase you fried your brain is a fate worse than death. I know of at least
for of my firneds who ar decidely less intelligent because of their drug
use , and the drug they used was LSD. Any drug with the effect of making
you dumber, i don't think is safe.

Just wondering how many of you out there are into yoga and where you practice
at....
I haven't been into it that long but have already had some really intense 
experiences with it and recommend it to everyone out there..... Oh, and I 
was wondering if anyone would be into getting a nice massage somewhere
then checking out the saunas at the saunas in J-town and then chowing down

LSD does not turn people into vegetables. It temporarily affects your
seratonergic reuptake, but it does not "fry your brain" (though it may
feel that way). It does not cause chromosome damage. It does not
contain strichnine.

There is no medical evidence that LSD causes any long term effects
whatsoever. No long term effects on cognition or recall. It is gone,
and I mean completely gone, within 4 days. If new evidence corrects
this, I'll be the first to post it.

LSD is medically contraindicated only in people who have latent
psychosis. This is not because LSD has any tendency to make people
psychotic; it does not. It is because LSD is usually a very intense
experience, and intense experiences are what tend to bring out a
psychosis.

People like to blame things on LSD but on closer look that the drug
may have been a factor, but not the cause. I see people throwing their
life away all the time, and they often use drugs, alcohol, or
obsessive activities to escape from the pain. They spiral down and
abuse themselves all sorts of ways. Blame it on drugs? What for? If
it's not one escape, it's another. Some people even (gasp) use
computers to escape, and even though using computers (presumably)
makes one smarter, no doubt someone feels it ruined a friend's life.
It's not even escape that's the problem (what is a vacation?), it's
_excess_ escape.

If LSD does have any long term effect, it is purely psychological. You
had an intense experience. Maybe for the first time you though about
things with your ego turned off. Maybe you saw things from a different
perspective. Maybe everything seemed new. Experiences like this make
one think, and most people report positive results with it. Some hate
it and never do it again.

LSD has been around for 50 years, and has been heavily used since the
60s. If there are any long term kinks, they must take more than 30
years to show up, because so far there is just no evidence of damage.

Just got done reading Jack's post on 187 and on an even broader scope, I 
have been reading and learning about how much power and influence the 
Fundamentalist Christian Right is gaining.  They are really the backbone 
of 187 and this whole movement is ***really*** petrifying!! I am amazed 
at how many people back this ultra conservative PAC.  What's even scarier 
that in the political world, $$$$ = POWER (they have lots of $) and these 
fundamentalists want
to control your life and mine. That is *******NOT****** okay with me!  
Let us try and change that equation to PEOPLE = POWER or we will be 
living in a very constricted, miserable existance.
just my 2 cents worth

Amy

Well I don't actually believe that we MUST vote just because we got
the privelege... 

but this year it seems that everyone is pissed off at the present politicians
and the choices for office. 
However, one interesting effect of this negativity is that it manifests
itself differently among the democrats than the republicans. The liberal
democrats just get pissed off and don't vote.... the conservative republicans
get pissed and come out en masse (christian churches have busses :)...
so.. if u happen to be a democrat...get out and vote... because the 
pissed off republicans will...
and if u happen to be republican... well I understand.. I used to be one
too... but stay home and have a nice cuppa tea :)

I realize that this "addiction" stuff is really getting old -- but if 
anyone out there wants some insight from a guy who has *really* "been 
there-done that", just start reading William S. Burroughs. Only a stone 
junkie can really tell ya what is going on there, and his insight into 
addiction and the whole phenomenon of drug use is quite valuable.

Maui

plus, he is just such a sick puppy -- the cool thing is, he *knows it*, 
and works with it.

just for the record, i believe moonpup's first ambient gig was at
Unity (boy, i'm feeling old, that was a while ago)...

whilst also picking nits, "This is our house, and our house music; I
am the creator" was sampled by the Revolting Cocks in "Beers, Steers
and Queers" from the album of the same name... there may be some
confusion, I'm fairly sure this is the reference Joe Turner
<jdt@concorde.com> thought was a Ministry song.  (The bands share
members, an easy confusion to fall into.)

yow,
Bob

Hey has anyone heard the rumor about the cost
for the 2 year anniversary party "Funky Techno Tribe"
Halloween Bash.  I have heard  the cost will be
$55.00 per person.  Please tell me this can not be true.
Also I have heard that it will be at the Galleria.

Does any one out there know.

Errr, my mom falls into this category and much as I love her and as much as
she'd like to I don't think she should run the world.  I think
 pre-menopausal girls would run a kick ass world though.  

In the early days of raves, you would often see people with whole bags full
of pistachios handing them out as if they were candy!  Of course pistachios
were actually legal pre-1978, before the FDA put them on the Schedule 1
list...

Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more..! The *only* good big raves ive been to so
far have been Funky Techno Tribes. For some reason they keep a great vibe with 
all those masses of people. Therefore it really is a bummer to have F&FIV on the
same night as FTTribe. My vote is for FTT this time, but hey who knows......

Now that I've got my hilarity under (hee hee) some control, I would like 
to elaborate, because I thought that this might come up.

The concept of a "patriarchal construct" really has nothing to do with 
either lesbians or lesbianism.

The term has been used, and quite widely I might add, to denote a social 
strucure in which the average person is placed in thrall to a figure of 
"worship" or whatever (this never did make much sense to me) that is 
outside of yourself, but supposedly contains *you*, nonetheless. It knows 
better than you do what you need, what you want, what is good, what is bad.
All terms are absolute. It is the Ultimate Because I Said So.

Female and Male have *nothing whatsoever* to do with this.

i think the Greens have it right when they suggest an additional
  little checkbox on each issue/candidate to be voted for:
   
   NONE OF THE ABOVE [   ]

if this choice beats the candidates (har har) then that means that the
  election (for that post) must be re-cast, with NEW candidates; this
    gets rid of the 'lesser of two lizards' syndrome that politics is
      heading for, by GETTING THEM OUTTA THERE!!!
if yer active in yer respective party, push for the 'none of the above' 
  option on the ballot.  if you don't like who's running, you should
    have the option of venting your opinion, and IMHO, this is the best
      idea around...

Greetings Friends!

Given that the discussion seems to be already well underway I thought I
might as well add my voice to the fray :)

Make no mistake... 

Friends & Family is going *off* this Saturday night!

Here are the details:

_____________________________________________________________________
DJs:
Lee, Susan, Sean Casey, Ethan, HDW, Graeme (LaPaix)
Jeff Taylor, Laura, Joe Rice, Deaks

Viusals:
Micheal Clay, Sean Casey & more...

Audio:
soundvision & liquid

$3 benefits Komotion 
415.985.5244 for more info
_____________________________________________________________________

I'm actually really glad that we're on the same night as FTT. Besides being
an established tradition :) it once again emphasizes exactly what we aim to
be: a *minimal* cost, intimate, all ages, techno-trancy *alternative* to
the larger and more expensive traditional sf parties. How nice that we have
so many wonderful choices :)

In other news: some small architectural changes at komotion have also
opened up the space in some nice ways and, while not yet perfect, we expect
ventilation to be greatly improved, though for those of you who like to
sweat (like me :) you should have no difficulty! As always, the sparsest of
attire (boxers and bras:) is recommended!

We stil need help in a variety of areas...if you can bring bean bags, art
supplies, butcher paper, stuffed animals, food, positive energy, or naked
guys or gals please do so. (I've actually got all the graffitti from the
last one! I'll transcribe and post it someday). As always we can use help
setting up, cleaning up etc. So if you'd like to be involved in any of
these or the above contexts, plese let us know.

look forward to seeing you all soon!
lots of love
ethan

[Shameless plug]

The last F&F was a _rave_... totally insane! It was packed all night,
and yet that tremendous energy felt friendly. I never heard so much
hollering at one event :). This one has an outstanding (and
enthusiastic) DJ lineup, lots of great visuals planned, good attitudes
all around, free water, ins & outs, etc etc.

Go to both if you want...each will be a good party, and each has great
things to offer. I'd say go to F&F first as it usually starts up and
gets vibed in very early. And it's so cheap you can afford both. :)

More likely $25, which is what they charged for Futur.  

At Megatripolis, one of the guys handing out those hideous poster-sized
flyers for FTT told me that it'll be in the city at a warehouse near
Army & 3rd where a Cool World was once held.  The space doesn't sound
too familiar to me, and it doesn't sound like the Galleria, but my info
my be totally unreliable.  If you decide to go, be prepared for long lines
and the absolute zoo that big Halloween Sat. nite city parties tend to be.

But who knows, FTT could end up being a lot of fun.  But at the very least,
you will want to consider the F&F and Megatripolis parties as less 
chaotic, and perhaps vibier alternatives to where the masses are heading.

Even though I have no hard facts here, it has been thought for quite some 
time that Bruce Lee might have died partly/or in toto  because of a massive 
dose of hashish.

I know that this is spurious info, I just thought it might be of interest.

Yeah, I've been there, my first flip experience, actually, tickets sold at
bass (the shame!) and narcs up the wazoo! The whole organic/ftt crowd was
there in the crowd, and carlos and jeno on the tables, great visuals, lousy
vibe. 

 But i am rambling. The warehouse had 2 anterooms, a mini-trampoline in one
of them, and a chill room in the back, must have been an office before.
Along one wall, a long row of portapotties, and the other, a loading dock
type thing for people to hide on/under. A very big warehouse, tho, everyone
will fit. Maybe it was my trip, or maybe the rafters did shake with the
music? 

I'll go the smaller way, methinks. 

Lotsa love, 
 Milton and the E-Bee...

Greetings!

For those of you interested in the saga of the Oyster Bay 21:

The attorney, Bob Selvidge, has finally concluded his negotiations with
the courts at Alameda County.  The charge was reduced to an infraction
(down from a misdemeanor), and the fine reduced to $50 total.  Each of
the people the attorney represented (we managed to get in touch with 20
of the 21 people cited--not perfect, but very good, considering that the
last person was not on the net and had no forwarding address or phone
number) will be receiving some mail from Bob in the next few days with
the various court papers and instructions on where and when to send the
money.  We have until December 30th, 1994 to pay the fines.

I'd just like to say a few things, now this matter is finally resolved
to the satisfaction (sort of) of those involved:  I want to apologize to
everyone for inviting them into a situation that resulted in such a financial
and time drain to everyone.  It was a very expensive party.  Your patience
and good humor in the face of these obstacles is much appreciated by me.

I would also like to point out to the rave community at large that people
DO get busted, and DO have to pay real money to defend themselves and even
so may still have to pay fines.  Our crime (and it is considered a real
crime, not some civil offense) was in being present on publicly owned
land between the hours of 10PM and 5AM, even though this was neither
posted nor advertised.  We were not warned, nor asked to move on prior
to being cited.  We were very fortunate in not being cited for additonal
violations of the law.

What i'd like you all to think about is:  Why is it illegal, even criminal,
to do what we did?  What can you do, what can we as a group do, to change
these laws in the broadest possible cases?  Are you aware that many 
communities in the Bay Area, and really, throughout the nation, regard
people under the age of 18 out after midnight to be criminals? Are you
aware that it is a criminal offense to be present on East Bay Regional
Park land between 10PM and 5AM, regardless of your age?  That we were
prosecuted despite the fact we were disturbing no one (the police were
NOT responding to any complaint)?

This may sound high-falutin and hackneyed, but i believe this to be true:
My civil liberties were infringed along with everyone else's, and our
freedom to assemble was denied.  This is a serious threat to our
constitutional rights, and our human rights to freely associate in the
place and manner of our choosing.  Frankly, and baldly, I think it's
wrong.  It was very much a matter of financial analysis and time, however,
that affected our decision to plead no contest; to fight and win the case
would have been prohibitively expensive.  I, for one, got yet another
personal taste of the justice system in this country, and got yet more
exposure to the use of "community standards" and behind-closed-door
dealings of the legal system.  I'm very sorry we couldn't do more to
fight and win this case; I tried to do the best I could with the
resources available.  It's my hope that someday, someone with legal and
financial backing will challenge these laws which, though well meaning,
infringe our personal freedoms.  I hope you will join any such challenge,
should it arise.

Thanks to all of you for your financial and moral support during this
difficult time.  I hope it was a "learning" experience for you, as much
as it was for me.

Well, I can say it's at a big location.  It WON'T be $55.  NO 
ONE could charge that much.  They have 2 locations picked out 
for it, one of them used before and the other a brand new 
location.  It will probably be $20 if it's at the new location, 
and $25 if it's at the old one.  Don't email me for hints on 
the location.. :)

Thanks, Bryce.  I don't think anyone could have done more, or said it
better, concerning this issue.  I'm very thankful that my friend's
reference to Bob worked out for you all, despite the fact it wasn't
the most optimal result.

 Bejesus! they can't stoop that low!? I'll bet ya one testicle (not both,

last line...

How any self-respecting urban denizen can go to a place called the cow

Well, I was fairly sure that:

Patriarchy = male
Matriarchy = female

Also, the best term for what you describe in the paragraph above is
"totalitarianism". :-)

Sunset was near the train tracks

I was chatting with a nice fellow who I had 
noticed blowing bubbles.  His name was Dave.
I was dancing a bit and thinking about the world
of people on the train and the world of people
dancing in the park. 

Then I meet John Draper (Mr Crunch). 
Dave, John, and I are dancing.

Dave is explaining the energy-refocusing techniques
and excercise regimen that allows John to stay up 4 days.
He doesn't eat much.
He dances.

Occasionally, John interjects an enthusiastic
comment while flailing about in front of us wild eyed
('Damn, you gonna Freak' - Big Bad Hank).  The music 
(respect) (in the most respectful manner) was clearly
affecting John in a positive way.

I'm thinking "what did he say?"
I try and explain how I had Thai food for lunch
and it was really good. I also like naps. In fact,
I sleep alot.

The music is good.  Very good.  We are dancing.
Another train comes by.  It moves the bushes.  The
wind increases.  The music is increasing.  It is stronger.

"... and so there are these energy points - John can find 
the weak ones ..."

The music is peaking.  I like the train.  Watching it.
Everyone is completely Going Off.  

and then
John 
Lunges Toward Me
Across the Grass
Buggy
Frantic
He SCREAMS - "I'm Evolving Into A Monster Who Doesn't Sleep!"

eeek
take it easy, girl

Everybody was down
Perfection
Another very nice Sunset


Dave

Speaking of Megatripolis, in the university Bruce Eisner, author of _The
MDMA Story_ will be presenting and update on E.  I'll take a break from
F&F just to stop by.

	A video I watched 6 hours before my first rave was filled at this 
location. Hmmm, it had pillars in it. and was quite large. THat is all I 
remember besides a green laser making patterns and the whole place was 
packed (they had shots just over the people's heads and the heads went 
from the the camera to the walls in all directions as they panned).

Hi Amy,

I am a subscriber to sfraves from Houston, simply because it is my
_favorite_ music that is the backbone. 

I totally agree with you on the fundamentalist right, please get through to
everyone you know that _VOTING_ is our best legal defense against this
Christian right mindset. It _IS_ scary. And they do have alot momentum!

Being one of the Oyster Bay 21 I'd really like to commend bryce for his
efforts on our behalf. Few "promoters" I know would have made it their
personal problem to undertake and succesfully execute the legal defense of
people busted at their party. What a fine example to set.

Good Job Bryce!

I would encourage you guys/girls to write about this and to publicise what
happened. Maybe,(a longshot) the Guarian or some other paper (the incident
was close to Berkeley) will pick up the story and publicise it even more,
after all it IS election time.

IMHO, Jerry Brown comes even closer.  (For example, when he was governor, he
refused to live in the palatial governor's mansion and drove around in an
old Plymouth.)

Unfortunately, Clinton was able to fool a lot of people into making the 
wrong choice in the primaries -- ask ANY environmentalist group about their 
disillusionment with him...

PS I know nothing about his sister - obviously, siblings can have entirely 
different points of view! :-)

There was an article about Rave Mass in yesterday's Oakland Tribune.  
Apparently it's sold out (300 tickets per "show").

Sometimes I get just so fed up with this country and all of its fucking 
stupid laws that I want to live somewhere else.  Bryce's report made me 
sick to my stomach.  Groups of people used to be able to assemble without 
any problems once upon a time.  Now all these idiotic laws practically 
keep people prisoners in their own homes - then the politicians who make 
these laws complain about the lack of COMMUNITY!!! how hypicritical!!
Bryce, if there is anything I can do to help your/our cause, count me in!!

Great post Dave!

I highly recommend John's exercise program for those who want to build 
energy, flexibility, and strength.  

I would like to point out, however, that I also enjoy and need sleep, 
even on weekends.

David

P.S. I'm afraid the pumpkin I'll be bring to F&F will be quite small.

If any of you would like to throw something together I'd like to run it 
in Resonance Magazine.  

(Resonance Magazine is being started to fill the gap in coverage XLR8R 
left when moving to bigger shores... It seems that many of the stories 
we're collecting for the first issue deal with THE LAW and HOUSE MUSIC.  
The Oystergate story might make a good addition to the cluster... We're 
doing a piece on pirate radio in Vancouver and a Seattle promoter who's 
suing the Seattle Police Department for harassment.)

I Am going to give a full tilt boogie endorsement for funky techno tribe
Besides throwing two free parties at the bandshell this year
They put together what was for me ,  the most intense rave of the year,
FUTUR... It fell short because many of older wiser ravers who are 
sceptical of big productions did not attend and I did feel like a freak 
banging my head to the hard sound of Joey Beltram while all the kids with 
tanning salon tans and protien powder bodies tried to find drugs (which 
were hard to find)... If only the cool Underground (yuck) could have come 
out to play that night It would have been that much better!!!

I know friends and family will be great AND GRAEME IS AT BOTH!
His tape from futur is COSMIC!! maybe I could carry in his records?...

ALSO Sunset needs an outdoor in town bust free location...any ideas?

salutations, allen@ameba

I just read my own post and decided it was kind of pointlessly drug oriented
so....here's some kind of point :-)

Everyone should try going out to a party sober as a right-wing religious
fanatic :-)  If you haven't tried this yet (no drugs? How do you do that?)
you owe it to yourself to try it once.  You will be amazed at how high you
get with no chemical assistance, though having had such assistance in the
past seems to help you "get there."    One good thing you will discover is
what your body really needs across the course of a night in terms of water,
food, etc.  Though some chemicals increase dehydration and some can make you
hungrier than normal, at least you'll know what's norma.  Ok, a double
expresso, guarana, or some power drink stuff will help you dance all night. 
Note that caffeine is addictive, dehydating and an appetite supressant not to
mention it comes from a plant grown in Columbia and is then refined and
processed, imported into the US and consumed with special paraphenalia to
concentrate the active ingredient in a viscous liquid(expresso!)  The street
price is quite high too, compared to homebrew ;-)

j..i.tt..tter..rrr.... .er er (jitterbuggers -great name - they had lots of
real original CocaCola you know - danced all night!)

Sure, I'd buy that, but it's never in stock. I called the warehouse to see
if there were any honest politicians left, but they said:

 Hey - Isn't it "Daylight losing time" this weekend? So when 12:00 rolls
 around - it becomes 11:00 and we have an extra hour to dance!

 Or an extra hour to check out more than one party but stop by F&F IV :-)

I'm tired of hearing rumors about the party.  FTT will be held 
at Cool World's FAT warehouse on 3rd and Army street.  The same 
warehouse the last Cool World was.  It will probably be either 
$20, or maybe $25.  NO MORE RUMORS!

Speaking of Megatripolis, in the university Bruce Eisner, author of _The
MDMA Story_ will be presenting and update on E.  I'll take a break from
F&F just to stop by.

Hello from Pacific!

Thanks to all who showed up at the Berkeley Aquatic park last Sunday, it 
was beautiful out there, and the police were once again chillin'.  
However, some people who came were spotted by locals doing such things as 
tagging buildings, urinating on buildings, and walking on the rail road 
tracks (probably not such a good idea given the locomotive factor).  In 
addition, two cars were broken into at the park.  All of these events 
were reported to the Berkeley police, and were connected to our party.  
As a result of these events and others events in the past at the Berkeley 
Marina, we will not be granted permits in Berkeley for a long while.  I 
do not resent the Berkeley police for their opposition to our party given 
the disrespect which some people have shown to this community.  I am, in 
fact, ashamed that people who attend our parties would enact such stupid 
maneuvers.  I urge anyone reading this to look out for foolish behavior 
around you in our scene and to point out this foolishness.  Perhaps we 
can collectively raise the standards of our celebrations so that we will 
be able to have them more easily in the future.

Anyway, on to the future: we have been organizing our side room at Funky 
Tekno Tribe, and it looks like we are going to be able to really do it up 
nicely.  The DJs for our room are going to be Dano, Binnie, Solar, Galen, 
Cyril, and Kenneth (hope I got the spellings right).  We have some cool 
art and trippy visual stuff planned for everyone to stare at!  This party 
is not free, but remember that some of the money taken at the door will 
benefit Pacific and allow us to bring you more dancing fun in the 
future!  Call: (415)266-8215 or (415)985-5264 for info.

After FTT is over, we are going to take our stuff out to a killer 
location in the city near the water for the Sunset Finale!  We're gonna 
start early, and continue through the day into the night!  This is the 
last one we're doing, so I hope to see everyone out there.  Let's end 
this party with the right vibe so we can all remember Sunset properly!  
Please, bring your love, respect, and smiles!  Tel: (415)985-5264

After this weekend we are going to chill a bit, and pay some more 
attention to the rest of life.  We will be throwing parties in the 
future, but less often and different from Sunset.  We hope that all of 
you will keep an eye our for our events, and come to them.  If you want 
to be sure of not missing any, you can send your mailing address (snail 
mail) to me <helagon@well.sf.ca.us> to get onto the Pacific mailing list.

I hope to see you all this weekend!  It's going to be PFHATT!!!
-Lorien

Just for the record...to avoid DJ confusion, Friends & Family will *not* be
implementing the time change until Sunday morning proper, say around 7am
(unconverted).

And, for your party-hopping and DJ identfying convenience, we will also be
posting our DJ schedule tomorrow. However, as always, we recommend coming
very early (in fact, before we even offically start:), those who do so on
this occasion will be very glad they did :)

take it easy

sorry about the non-topicality of this, but since many of you
also use netscape/WWW, I thought I'd mention a problem with
that browser -- it violates your internet privacy. fortunately
you can override the main privacy violation.

Yours in spreading fear uncetainty and doubt,
		Niels.

Here's another even worse problem with netscape -- it sends your e-mail
and/or account name back to the HTTP server at the WWW site you are
browsing.  This is great for WWW sites interested in creating
interest-based mailing lists for future internet junk-mail and
direct-marketing. Of course this feature can be used for "good" as well as
"evil" -- but it is quite annoying and sneaky that the user is not warned
about this breach in privacy and security prior to using netscape.

Also, netscape sends HTTP servers information on the URL which referred you
to the current HTTP server. This will allow advertisers to collect
information on outside sites that they might want to influence with
advertising dollars.

By default most HTTP servers don't collect this information, but it is
trivial to set up an HTTP server that logs the account name, host,
and referring page for each access to the server.

Also note that I'm not against commerce on the internet, but I do believe
that people should know what they're getting themselves into by using
netscape's default settings. (Just like most people know that giving their
name/number/usps-address during a retail credit card purchase will put them
on a wide variety of mailing lists). But maybe you all *like* the idea of
the internet equivalent of MCI/Sprint/ATT calling you up and interrupting
your dinner....

Finally, I have nothing against MCOM or netscape -- I much appreciate
"mosaic done right", and in particular the effects of proper useage of
XtAppAddInput() in doing network reads...

| Subject: netscape sends your e-mail address??
| --------
| 
| We ran netscape into 'socket' and noticed that it was sending back
| one's e-mail address to the server. This seems kind of anti-social,
| somewhat sneaky, and a real privacy leak:
| 
| | >> socket -sl 8000 
| | GET / HTTP/1.0
| | Referer: http://home.mcom.com/home/welcome.html
| | User-Agent: Mozilla/0.9 beta (X11; IRIX 5.2 IP22)

| 
| Fortunately, if you go to Options->Preferences->Mail And Proxies you can
| change the "your email" field to something else, and the "From" field
| above will change accordingly. 
| 
| For example, I was able to change the from line to
| 
| | From: marca@mcom.com
| 
| So now I guess I can read
| 	http://www.i.love.sheep.com/bondage-and-bleating.html
| in complete privacy. :-) Unfortunately, all the e-mail I send from mozilla
| will look like it came from marca... bummer.

		club townsend holiday toy drive for
		     pediatric aids patients

	the holiday season is quickly approaching!  each
	december club townsend sponsors a toy drive to benefit
	the in-patients of the ucsf pediatric aids unit.
	with a donation of a new, unwrapped toy, patrons
	will receive a discount on the admission price to 
	the club.

	this year club townsend will begin the toy drive on
	saturday november 12th.  the holiday party for the
	ambulatory and out-patients will take place on 
	december 4th.

	ucsf is a designated california childrens services
	hiv program centre, providing a clinic for screening
	and treatment.  the clinic offers testing, counseling,
	hiv treatment, and access to hiv preliminary testing
	treatments for pediatric patients from all over
	northern california.

	due to the increase in the infection rate of hiv and
	the occurrence of aids in children, the staff of club
	townsend is putting out a call to this community. 
	please assist us in providing joy to children during 
	the holiday season and throughout the year.

	gifts are needed for boys and girls from infancy to
	pre-teen.  besides coming to club townsend with a 
	toy donation, you can also contact us regarding placing 
	a donations barrel at your place of business.  donations
	of wrapping paper, ribbons and other gift wrapping
	decorations will also be greatly appreciated.

	for further information, please contact phil smith
	or audrey joseph at 974-1156.  please mention that
	you saw this posting here.

	thank you for your support!!

This weekend's choice is a no-brainer - Ethan and Bryce bring back
Friends & Family to Komotion.  Go early - it should get going
quickly...  Party hoppers might want to stop by Funky Tekno Tribe (may
be expensive) or the Halloween Megatripolis, which has a lot going on
too.  Afterward, find the final Sunset of the season - call for
location.

Thanks to everyone who's been sending info (especially Sun Kim the last
couple of weeks).  Please remember to send it to dhchung@us.oracle.com,
not dchung@us.oracle.com - someone else here's been getting a lot of
strange mail! :)

I'd like to put some names with faces at Friends and Family so if anyone sees
me there don't be a weenie!  Jump in my face and tell me who the hell you
are...I'd love to meet some of the other faces I keeping reading :) 
      I'm the one wearing an "Xing" shirt with a yellow crossing sign with
dancers on the front.  Its pretty obvious...Purple Tiger, Maui are a few
names that come to mind at the moment so if I don't run into you make
yourselves known!  If you're lucky you just might get a Jolly Rancher from me
;)
rave on and peace out

Gez, I even dup my apologies.  I think I need a babysitter.

MAYBE I SHOULD JUST START WRITING IN ALL UPPER CASE SO IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M SHOUTING ALL THE TIME. SOMEBODY HELP ME, I'VE STARTED MY DAY WITH
A QUADRUPLE SHOT LATTE AND IT STILL HASN'T WORN OFF YET.  ARRGH!!!

Purple Tiger - Please God let me fall asleep just this once and I promise
               that I'll never make fun of you again.  I especially promise
               not to tease you when you manifest pink, floppy bunny ears
               in church. Really.

I'm attempting to move out to SF by December 1.

I already have one job offer, and am waiting on another two today and
Monday.  Now I need a place to live.

Anyone need someone for December?  I'm reasonably quiet, no pets (and
I'm slightly! allergic to cats/dogs), non-cigarette-smoker, and I like
keeping common areas neat and tidy (though I'm not a neat freak).

And obviously, I like going to raves. :-)

If you need someone, or if you know someone, please leave email for me
at cutter@bronze.lcs.mit.edu, or call me at work at 800-333-2SUN,
extension 358, or at home at 617-254-2552.

Thanks for your attention, and sorry for the interruption.

/joe

Hi there!!
My mane ie Ryan, and I am at McGill university.  I got your e-mail
number off of the Alt.Rave news group and was hoping that you may be
able to help me out with something...  I'm compiling a number of
articles for a small zine which I want to produce about Rave-Culture
as a class project...That's where I need your help, if possible.
Since you were on the internet, I guess I assume that you know more
about Raving than I do!! I was hoping that you wouldn't mind writing
a brief article or opinion piece which I would include in my project.

  Some of the things I had in mind were:
is there a philosophy to rave culture (why did it come about?)
Are drugs (extacy) or smart-drinks important, and why?
Do sexual/racial/social boundaries break down in environments
      like a rave?? (I think that they DO!!)
-----or any other topic which you may just want to write a quick
page about so as to help me out.
   I'm trying really hard to get in touch with people around the
world (I've got some answers from the states, canada, and australia!!)
I'd really like to have your input, too, though.

If you cant help me out, I understand but hope that you will write to
say that you got my messasge (I'm new on email and want to make sure
that I'm sending okay).  If you've got any questions I would be
thrilled (!!!!!!) to hear from you, and I hope that you can help
me out......

            'Till later!!  Ryan  FAAX@MUSICB.MCGILL.CA

Well, I knew my statement about the relationship between house and 
gospel/spiritual music 
was rather categorical.  I am talking about the more soulful styles of 
house music, i.e. with a lot of vocals, organ licks, etc. I try to keep
persective about music.  Check out the book The Gospel 
Sound for more info on gospel's influence on popular music (interesting 
stuff such as that
gospel is the only form of music organized matriarchally, except I would 
also include Womyn's music of course).  

My point was that since religious institutions are some of the most 
segregated in American society, and African-American religious music has 
so much to offer, the 9 O'clock rave mass people could use these elements 
to bring different people together, and that we would all be the richer 
for it.

The question is: Does that pink, floppy bunny ears God have an energizer

Greeting all fellow ravers and Happy Halloween weekend! >:-}
I stopped by Grace Cathedral yesterday ( Thurs.) to check out the Rave 
Mass set up and thought I'd share what I know.. 
Grace Cathedral is located on Nob Hill, on California at about Taylor - 
near the Fairmont Hotel. It is accessible by Cable Car ( Calif. line) or 
via car. There is *very* little on street parking, so I recommend drivers 
park in the Masonic Hall garage. It cost $2.00 per half hour and is open 
24 hours. As tickets are free, this shouldn't set us too far back in the $$$
land :)
The Mass goes off AT 9:00 PM - from 9:00 until 10:30Pm - and that is 
it!!!!!!! So no showing up at 12 mid - we'll all be at F&F or FTT :):):)
I repeat 9:00 pm - 10:30 PM
The set up looks *very* *very* cool. We will be *surrounded* by visuals
on monitors and projection screens. There is a cool alter, intellabeams, 
and the 35 Sheffield people are really into it. I talked a while with 
Tom (T.C.) Hill, the lighting director, and some of the women, Ann and 
another lady whose name I missed - *really* nice people. I will be 
limping in on Saturday night, and look forward to seeing ya'll there!!
Peace and happy horrors! Lady Trash

                                               WHY   TRIBAL  FUTURE  ?

     "The only thing constant is change"  Since humanity started keeping 
track of history, this maxim  
has been presumed correct. Many of the changes, if extrapolated 
indefinitely, unfortunately lead to the demise of the planet. Why is it 
that tribal societies, where there is no concept of fashion , maintain 
harmonious cultures for many thousands of years ?  A deeper look into the 
psyche of pre-literate peoples might illustrate to us all that indeed, if 
we are to survive, a peaceful future will have to resemble our ancient 
tribal past . 
    Before there were alphabets , people didn't read about the past  , 
they talked about it.  Prophesies and legends were told and retold from 
generation to generation , sung , chanted , or spoken from grandparent to 
grandchild in an unbroken verbal chain . Changes in the tribes tradition 
were unthinkable, very often taboo . The design of a clans clothing or 
the lyrics of a chanted legend would remain the same for hundreds of 
generations. In tribal societies there is truly no such thing as fashion 
because the very fabric of life is dependent on keeping the oral 
tradition unchanged .    
    History begins when people start keeping track of events by writing 
things down. Cultures without written alphabets are generally considered 
prehistoric . A written record fragments time into the past and the 
future with little emphasis on the now. The procession of fashion 
parallels the progress of history.   As we turn the pages of history we 
become accustomed to a seemingly endless cycle of newness ,we want new 
clothes every season , a new car every year, soon we will need a new rain 
forest, but can technology provide us with one? 
    In non-materialistic tribal societies, a person was judged not by 
their accumulation of wealth but by their generosity and number of 
friends. Great chiefs had few possessions at all, witness the potlatch 
ceremony where valuable gifts were exchanged only to be burned in a great 
communal bonfire. Perhaps there are valuable lessons to be learned from 
our ancestors who had a direct connection with the spiritual essence of 
nature and felt no need to interfere with the natural flow of things .  
Primitive cultures all have in common some form of ecstatic boundary 
dissolving ritual or ceremony that bonds people to the greater spirit of 
nature. People who have  dissolved the boundaries between themselves and 
the spirit of Mother Earth might feel less need to amass wealth or to 
dominate other people or species. 
    The thrust of technology throughout history has largely been to 
separate people from nature, at the expense of many less fortunate 
species. We have unwittingly become specists , letting the mediated 
experience of  entertainment and religion replace the direct knowledge of 
the planetary soul with the false concept that  western man is somehow 
above, or separate from, or superior to this wonderful world of peoples, 
plant, and animals that we call home . 
     Blaming technology itself is too simple an answer, but many 
destructive practices , if continued, signal the death of the planet.  
There are developments in technology however, that have the potential to 
create an electronic re-tribalization of society and help humanity 
remember our place on this sacred sphere . 
Virtual communities on-line are changing the way we perceive each other 
and share ideas, there is no pre-judgment of concepts based on sex or 
color, a new form of universal language has emerged. Another universal 
language is rapidly transforming the way people interact. House music, 
tribal dance music with a continuous beat is the soundtrack to an 
enormous youth movement worldwide. House parties are basically an updated 
version of an Indian Pow-Wow where certain members of the tribe provide 
the beat ( D.J.'s or drummers ) and the other members of the various 
tribes come together in peace to share the blessings of being alive, 
dress wild, act crazy and dance themselves into oblivion. Out of this 
oblivion is where one gains knowledge , direct experience of  the 
equality of all people and creatures of the universe.  The insight gained 
by abandoned tribal dancing changes a person , spiritual awareness is no 
longer a mediated experience but an irrefutable feeling.
     As more and more people have boundary dissolving insights into 
nature and more and more of these people link minds with each other via 
technology we can hope for a future where an awareness of  the spiritual 
value of nature is factored into decisions regarding the fate of the 
planet . By loving each other , dancing with each other , and 
communicating with each other we have our best hope for a future where 
all people, plants , and creatures co-exist in peace and harmony 
.

hi ryan,
i would suggest that you GO to a rave and get some experience yourself.
why believe/accept my experience ? plus, there are things that can not
be put into words very well, are best experienced directly. check out
the rave scene in/near mcgill.
take care/shalom/rave out

Is this main floor and this ambient room??????????

Ethan can you explain both columns.  Are you actually spinning in the
ambient room?  I have to admit I would be a little shocked and maybe a
little disapointed because your techno/trance sets are just so killer.  I
thought Bryce was spinning on the main floor also. =/

Better than that, Denis -- F&F will be running "anything goes" in
both rooms.  The people in the first column are in the front room,
the people in the second column are in the back.  

I don't know about anyone else, but expect something quite different
from me.  I'm pulling out a lot of silly collectables I've got,
including the famed KLF track "The Queen and I," which was banned
because it sampled (errr, stole) just about the entirety of Abba's
"Dancing Queen."  I'm thinking of my set as being a sort of "Mystery
Science Theater 3000" of music, including no-beat, spoken word, trance,
acid, industrial-dance, and disco.  I figured since I'll be in the front 
room I can just go insane.

To me, different spaces and environments bring out different moods
and types of music.  The reason my set at Megatripolis was so driving
was because I got really caught up in the environment -- the big
space, the intellabeams, the huge sound -- it was the right place to
showcase the driving acid trance I love.  But I couldn't get away with
playing certain tracks there, because a big room has a certain vibe.
Likewise, there are certain tracks I'd never play during a sunrise set,
they just aren't fitting.  So what I'm babbling about is that the front
room could be quite interesting because of the conditions it gives the
DJ to work with.  Ok, I'm going to shut up and go pick my records for
later.  See you all, and make sure you say HI when you come in!

Laura

Only one of us got ticketed. He was chosen to get the ticket because he had
the sound van in the park. The district attorny contacted him and wanted to
ask
a few questions (to see if it was worth proscuting, I guess). We all went to
the
interview and after explaining that it was a alcohol-free party. He decided
to
drop the charges and told us to get a permit next time.

   Unfortunatley, the emergecny room won :( .. I have been spending this 
entire week trying to get well and overcome my severe sore throat and 
swolen glands...  But nothing was working, not even penecilin (sp?) so I 
had to go to the ER instead of the party ..  Anyways, I sent a whole 
BUNCH of my friends and told them they HAVE to go and stay ALL night..  
Hopefuly they will heed these doctor's orders :)

   I'm super bummed I didn't get to spin, or even go for that matter, but 
I'm looking forward to reading all the amazing reviews that will flood my 
mailbox over the next few months! :)

Peace out and rave on and ::cough cough:: ... ughh.. :>

Speaking of rabbits, I'm reminded of a very profound event that happened to me
not too long ago.  It was on Memorial Day in the middle of the Black Rock
desert at an event called Burning Man.

Not to far from our encampment, someone had corded off an area and placed a
replica of the ten commandments in it.  Later they added a cross and then
they erected three foot high white neon letters that spelled "GOD".  Some sort
of statement i'm sure.

My profound moment happened on Sunday night, a church night.  It was after
they had raised the man, and then razed the man, and then danced in the man's
ashes.  We had built a warm, welcome fire at our camp and many people had
joined us around the fire.  There wasn't much talking around the fire, mostly
just quite whispers and staring into the fire.  Occasionaly, even the
whispering would stop and all you could hear was the crackling of the fire.
It was during one of the really quite moments that a woman yelled out:

   "THERE ARE RABBITS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF GOD!!!"

Everyone looked at her kinda funny and then she stood up and pointed, "No,
look, rabbits" and she pointed over at the "GOD" sign.  And there, on the
other side of the God sign, there were man sized rabbits with pink bunny ears
hopping around on and looking quite cute.

And somehow, at that moment, a complete sense of "rightness" came upon me.  It
so strong that I knew that it couldn't be any other way.  The universe would
cease to be a fun and magical place without rabbits on the other side of God.

Ciao,

Purple Tiger

of gee, holloWeenie in sf.  and im stuck at a club party
working, flailing, going spastic tryin to get a dial tone

i REALLY regret not be able to FF4!

the karma, the time waves, the situation wouldn't allow what i wanted
last night, "u cant always get whatcha want"

anyway, megatripolis was sparse, i was working there.  only one other
vender pushing "herbal ecstasy" and me.  i was asked to provide internet
access.

the music was danceable, but you kinda need a crowd to really
get people movin.  was that single cell upstairs? or space time c?
it hardly matters, i didnt hear enough of them, workin a club is hard
when you feel like having fun.  damn.

heard bruce eisner yak about e.  1st question to eisner, "where can i 
get some?"  i felt like an e fiend bonding with other e fiends.  or
a support group exchanging first experiences.  man, i really regret not
be able to FF4.  

blathering off.

barry

Oh shit!

Reminds me of my first rave, when I walked in and was assaulted by a
wall of sound, projections on all the walls, and a crazy insane vibe.
It's even more incredible to think I helped make it happen. Geeez...

At 10 till 10, the party was going and there were already 51 people
there dancing like fiends. I've been to an awful lot of parties and I
am totally impressed at people showing up early ready to party.
Tamotsu opened the "big room" and just tore it up from minute one. And
that pretty much describes the night. A totally insane vibe but VERY
friendly and a massive smile factor.

$3 bought you one hell of a party. Thanks to everyone for showing up
and spreading your good vibes around. You were just wonderful.

Sean

	I'll never forget the looks on Ethan and Bryces faces
	when FF I went off at the Blue Cube. That look of
	"ah ha. now we *have* something"

	3 awesome events later FF has become the best regular party
	this city has ever seen bar none- and I've been at them from
	the beginning.
	
	pure positive energy, low smoke environment, awesome sound,
	awesome visuals, and the best DJS around- all from our SFRaves
	family

	It was fun not actually bringing the WBL gear and playing
	instead the WBL crew danced all night and that was awesome

	of course thanks to ethan and bryce for their infinite energy
	and expert promotional skills

	and to everyone who was there for being positive awesome people.

I'm still trying to sort out and make some sense of what happened 
yesterday at Sunset.  The party finally went off at around 3:30 at the 
3rd & Cargo location after the first site was busted. Galen, Jason and 
the rest of the Pacific crew deserve lots of credit for persevering with 
this party despite no sleep and having to haul their equipment all over 
the City.  Those of you who were there know it was an incredible 
party--great energy, vibe, music, etc. But unfortunately, the world of 
violence invaded our world of love.

For those of you who don't know this location, the 
party was held out on a spit of land surrounded by water on three sides. 
To get from the parking lot to the site, you have to walk quite a ways 
along a winding path that has grasses and shrubs alongside it. At 
around 7:30-7:45, the music stopped, and someone asked whether 
anyone in the crowd had a cellular phone.  Apparently there had 
been a mugging in the parking lot. Someone was hit over the head 
(with a bottle? a gun?) and there was gunfire.  Luckily, someone 
did have a phone, and the police were called. Because of 
the distance between where we were and the parking lot, it was impossible 
for us to know what was going on. Rumor flew of course; there 
was a whole gang out there, they were coming down the path, they were 
hiding in the bushes along the path waiting for people to leave.  People 
took responsibility for sharing what information there was and for making 
sure no one left the site. We were stuck out there for about an hour 
until we got the word that the police were in the parking lot and it was 
ok to leave. There was more or less and exodus at that point; safety in 
numubers I guess. Walking back to the parking lot was eerie--in my group, we 
were all 
hyperalert, scanning the darkness for who knows what. I'm still shaken by 
this experience; I can't quite find the words to express how I feel. I do 
want to thank our community for pulling together in the face of this 
violence; we took care of each other as best we could. And I want to 
thank the man who had the cellular phone--I can't remember your name, but 
I appreciate your letting me borrow it. If the people who were attacked 
are reading this, my heart goes out to you.

Some lingering questions:
Does anyone know more about who was hurt and how serious it was?
Does anyone know why it took the police what seemed like forever to 
respond? (I heard they were called 2 or 3 times before they sent a car.)
Does anyone have better/more complete information? 
What is going on in this world when a group of peaceful, loving ravers 
is in effect held hostage by the threat of people with guns? I do my best 
to understand and accept through the prism of love, but I don't really know 
how to understand and or accept this.

i'm not sure condemning fashion/trendiness/change per se is a
  not towards or an embracing of tribality.
some anthropologists have found quite a lot of trendiness and fashion
  evident in rather untouched tribes, and archeologists have DEFININITELY
    ININIETLY (luv my spelling) found a great amount of exchange of ideas
     (read: ancient trends) between, say, a mountain tribe and a
      shoreline tribe (the adoption of shells as scapers, for example,
        or the exchange of medicinal herbs)
this was especially evident in the Pacific Northwest, where fishhooks,
  calabashes, masks, etc. were copied and exchanged all over the place.
    True, each region had it's own 'flavor', but that's still evident
     today everywhere you go in the world, beneath the Sonys and the
       Coca Colas....
IMHO, tribalism isn't about technology, trendiness, pop culture 
  OR THE LACK OF IT.  It's about your local area.  It's about the
    common kinds of things people in your locale see, think, and do.
      even a country club is a tribe of sorts, albeit a very close-minded
        one, yesno?

don't cast off those trendy shackles, 'cause an archeologist ten thousand
  years from now will be identifying yer "tribe" based on your type
    of car, musical preferences, or favorite type of soda pop.....
      that may sound cynical and hollow, but in a way, the style
        of totem poles you saw around north america 1000 years ago
          was basically a trendy way of showing off the family tree...

ok, you can castigate me now

Well I'm not normally in a flaming mood... but now dammit I am:

In this morning's chronicle, regarding the rave mass this weekend:



" The look is 'rave', but this feels like a different community," 
said Strickland, a computer programmer from Menlo Park who heard about the Mass on the Internet.
"These people are not ravers," he said. "No one here offered me any drugs."



Well, there it is for all the World... the front page of the Chronicle...
raves=drugs... Jesus H Christ... How could any real raver believe that?
Henry Strickland, if ur out there, why in the hell did you say that?

Greetings!  and thanks, SFRaves, for helping make Friends and Family the
place I wanted to be this last Saturday!  I had a total blast, from setting
up, to playing, to seeing you all, to dancing, to tearing down.  So many
people helped out in large and small ways, I can't possibly thank you all
properly. And, there sure seemed to be hella non-list people at this party.
I was especially tripped out by the visuals, and *loved* the series that
started with "Because..."--absolutely BRILLIANT.

"Because we care.  Because we like to dance.  Because they told us we 
couldn't" and many more that I can't remember, but ~do~ remember cheering
to, because they were so right on.  Michael Clay mentioned that the words
came from some sort of Komotion manifesto, and I'd love to have the whole
series some time.  

What more can I say?

Awesome! Thank you!

I was leaving when people came running toward the party.  A couple
of young women were obviously upset.  They said they were beat up
by 4 guys with a shotgun.  This seemed serious to me.  I spoke
to others running back to the party.  I got the same story.

I immediately went over to the cab of the truck and saw one
of the Pacific guys (Jason?).  Anyway, I explained what was
happening and asked if he had a cell phone.  I said that we
needed to call the cops immediately.  He went and saw the
crying assaulted girl.  Solaar and Jason decided not to call
the cops yet.  I told a few people not to leave since it might be
dangerous.  I didn't want to cause rumors but it didn't seem
right to let groups of 2 or 3 innocent raver girls walk into an 
armed robbery situation.

Anyway, a few minutes later I started walking out (I was trying to
leave in the first place) with a small group of Pacific folks.
It was wierd how the story unfolded as we spoke to people still
arriving.  Some saw a commotion.  Some saw the gun.  Later people
saw 4 men running down street.  The last people I saw arriving
at the party knew nothing.  I left without any problem.

Forgive my brashness, but have you just arrived on this planet?  Our society
has so "class"ified itself that certain people and groups of people are
just doing their job (or what is expected of them).  What better targets
than the peaceful loving ones?  Sorry they jolted you back to reality, but
your peaceful vibes in the wilderness aren't gonna change a thing.

I finally manage to make it to an F&F.  Absolutly incredible.  Happy, Happy,
Happy smiling, dancing, crazy fun vibe all over.
I had some vague intent to go to FTT later in the night since I was on the
guest list, but I completely forgot that plan after a few minutes dancing.
 Hi to doug with the squirt bottle and all the other friendly folks with
candy and hugs and kisses. Who spun the last set in the big room?  Thanks for
playing some real morning music in the morning instead of hardcore till the
break of dawn. 

still smilin,
Bret

Hi, everyone! This is my first post. :) I am pretty new to the Bay Area,
and it is great to be here after being in Rhode Island for the past six
years.

Anyway, I just wanted to tell everyone what an incredible time I had at the
Planetary Mass Sunday night. My friend Don and I had planned to arrive well
before the beginning of the service at 9pm. Unfortunately, we didn't allow
quite enough time for the bus and ended running up one of the steepest
hills I have seen in SF. We arrived, wheezing, at around 9:20. Luckily, the
event hadn't begun quite yet. We were pleased.

The mass was held in the basement gymnasium of the Grace Cathedral. The
space was rather plain, but the people putting on the mass had done it up
with several projection screens, some regular TVs, a pretty large stereo,
and an altar in the center of the room with a spherical projection ball
suspended above it. It was an impressive instalation.

What was most impressive was the feeling I got attending the mass. I am not
a religious person, or rather, I was not brought up within any organized
religion, but this Mass really affected me. I don't want this message to go
on too long, so let me conclude that these people from England really have
the right idea. I am glad that I was able to attend their service.

If you have any questions about what went on at the service, email me directly.

Those guys in the parking lot -- every last one wearing a 49ers parka and
with the low rides and the fuckin MPV too, drinkin 40s -- were real gangstas.
Makes those gangsta style folks at the Marina look like friendly ravers huh?
 Anyway weird shit and confusing information and scared people and that
little bit of extra paranoia that you wish would go away.  Some great music
though and that one DJ(the Belgian guy?)  spun some different stuff in a very
distincitve style.  Not really a continuous beat-matched thing, but
interesting energy shifts and moods.  Killer sets by Tony and Galen(I think
there's something synergisitic about hearing both of them) 

Happy Halloween!

I regret not making it to F&F, cause it does sound wonderful.
But my previous pleasure with Futur inspired me to ravage
Funky Tekno Tribe... and I wasn't dissapointed.
Big beautiful lights and lots of happy people,
and booming sound, and that, from time to time
is just a heck-of-a-lotta fun.  Although I am looking
forward to pursuing a whole slew of intimate personal
parties for a while now.. hopefully the next F&F will
be soon for me.
Pacific's ambient village wasn't really so ambient,
but it was real nice too.  A small room with clean funky
toons and more good dancing.
One particular pleasure fore me this weekend was getting my
housemate of three years to finally attend his first rave.
He's never danced in his life and never really cared for
all that "repetitive noise" I always play, but after
some slight mood alteration and submersion into the world
of the groove he was dancing and loving it.
When he left he said that he got in his car and turned on his
stereo with his tape of the pixies and said, "that beat sucks."
*grin*
Then I had a great time at Sunset... good people, good
vibe, good music... These parties were indeed the highlights
of my summer.  I hope next summer brings something so wonderful too.
As I was leaving I heard the music stop.  I made it to my
car safe and sound and didn't notice anything.
I'm shocked and horrified to hear about what happened.
My heart goes out to you who was hurt.
It's amazing how  much goodness there can be right alongside
the evils of the world.
Like getting my car stereo stolen while a few weeks ago while in
love with Wicked.
But, onward we go, with Salutes to the Pacific crew,
and all that I am with my heart and praise to the glory of
friends and house music.
It was good seeing you again, Cathy, and Andrew and Katheryn and Tom
and Jeff and Milton and everyone else and the pixie nymph girl who
was the definition of grace and beauty dancing outside to the
sunrise
Looking forward to Basics.
-john.

Unfortunately, I was unable 2 make it 2 the last sunset.  But after 
reading what U wrote about it, I'm kinda glad I didn't go!!  Here's my 
question, What in hell is up with that location!!!!  Since I've only been 
on sfraves for a short time, I'm not sure if this was already covered but 
if it hasn't, here is what happened about 3 weeks ago at that same place.

The event was called "bonding of the spirits" and was meant 2 be a 
wedding ceremony for Charles (Chaz?) and his fiancee.  Things started off 
on a bad foot from the beginning.  Our friend Trent went 2 park his car 
and we started walkin' up the path 2 where the rave wuz.  Soon we saw 
that someone was tryin' to start a fight with some other guy but luckily 
this got stopped by several other ravers.  Wondering where Trent was, we 
started heading back to the parking lot when we met up with a large-ish 
group of people.  They said that it "cost $2 to leave the party" and 
literally physically pushed us back and prevented us from leaving. 
Several other remarks such as "it costs $2 if U got blond hair" and "it 
costs $2 if U R a girl" were also said by them but eventually we were 
able to squeeze through them.  After finding Trent, we walked back along 
2 the rave.  Now, that same bunch of dicks had pushed a huge object (I'm 
not sure exactly what it was) across the path and were tellin' people 
that it cost $2 to get in.  We told them that it was Charle's wedding 
ceremony and that he had said it was a FREE event. They responded with 
"Charles?  we don't know any charles.  Give us $2!" and again literally 
pushed us around.  After 5 minutes of this bullshit we finally got past them.
	Now we kinda started dancin' but could tell that the vibe at this 
party was shit.  A little later I heard all these popping sounds and a 
huge group of peeple started walking *quickly* out towards the rocks and 
water.  I wondered why this was and assumed that maybe bottle rockets 
were being set off and people were afraid of gettin hurt.  Then I saw the 
dj take off his headphones and start takin' off in a direction.  WHAT?? 
That's when I noticed some guy by the water with a gun firing shots (lots 
and lots of shots). I could see the blaze of his gun.  At this point I 
turned and ran with everyone else as far away as possible. Soon it 
stopped, and about a half hour later the police showed up.  Apparently 
someone had gotten shot and was being operated on at the hospital.  The 
next day I heard that this person was paralyzed but that part might not B 
tru.
	So, what is up with all this??  How come the once peaceful rave 
scene is now erupting with violence??  More importantly how can we 
prevent it?? (having security 2 search people @ free outdoor parties 
would B difficult).  After the event that I just described, a week later 
someone pulled a gun @ some party at 24th and illinois, and now sunset.
What is our scene turning in2????
HELP!

HAPPINESS IS BEING AMONG FRIENDS

Yes - my roommate and some other friends. They were walking up the path
when they saw some people arguing. One of them had a shotgun so they
dropped to the ground and hid, but were spotted when some other people came
up the path and confronted the armed man. My roommate had a guy with a
pistol point it at her haead and had another man put a knife to her throat
and they wnt through her pockets and took everything. One of her friends
was hit in the back of the had with the shotgun. After the robbers left
they went back to call the police - an action that one or more of the
Sunset organizers didn't want to take. (Possibly to avoid bust?) Anyway,
the police were called, but after they didn't show up within a half hour or
so they left, figuring they weren't going to respond.

The whole situation is really sad and disgusting. With the shooting at 24th
and Illinois a couple weks ago this leaves a bad taste for anything in the
city that dosn't have some sort of security.

hi, all!

glad to hear the good tidings of FFIV! and sorry to hear
the sad tidings of Sunset :<( 

Perhaps we should all become peace officers. Seems to me that 
would solve many problems. policing our own parties; free 
access to radio communication equipment; nifty visuals a la
cop car; a lot of badge flashing to discourage any hostile 
elements; 21-gun salutes for a REALLY KILLER SET a la oldtime 
ranchero/a fiesta! maybe a helicopter ride or two; insider 
info on spotting plainclothes; and best of all: peacekeeping!

and speaking of peacekeeping-

In other news, there was a Merc article about the 
Pentagon saying that they had officially replaced the 
word "peace" with "pre-hostility." so those of you 
who thought you might be in a peaceful state of mind 
should be aware that, segun los federales, you are actually 
in a pre-hostile state of mind.

and we wonder where it comes from.....

I wish some raver techno-heads over thirty-five would 
form a political menagerie- promising to give everyone 
an authentication key for a new direct democracy.
PAP- the People's Public Accountability Party.... 

Wistfully yours (sigh)-

wanted to know if he could get the scoop on the Portland scene, if any.  thanks

I'm very sorry to hear about the violence at Sunset. However you must 
realize that the location was very risky. That part of town is very 
dangerous. It is easy to get upset and mad at the perpetrators,I 
certainly abhor violence but we must realize that these are societal 
problems and they have roots in very complex systemic problems. I'm 
not trying to make excuses for the muggers       but we must starty to 
realize that we are all interconnected and until our society really 
starts to address its systemic problems we will continue to be threatened 
with violence from many arenas.

I hope that the injured persons are okay and that we continue to spread 
positive energy as well as engaging in critical reflection and action to 
help transform our violent dominator society and world into something 
ecological and festive.

>From what I saw both F&F and FTT went off in a big way on Sat. night. I
started out at F&F, where people started showing up _early_ and were
dancing by 10pm, the official start time. Definately a rare occurance in my
book. I liked what I heard in both rooms.

I decided to check out FTT since I was able to get on the guest list via
some timely luck. $25 is way too much for a party - especially a warehouse
party. I'd already heard some bad things about it - namely that they had
refused to honor the $15 before 9pm pledge and the wait in line was over an
hour. When we arrived at around 1am there was a huge queue outside. They
didn't handle getting people into the party very well. There was only one
point of entry and the searches were fairly severe, although it was obvious
they were just looking for weapons and bottles.

Once inside I remembered what a RAVE was like. This was it. At least 3500
people in a huge warehouse with a dozen varilites and intellabeams,
projections all over the back wall, two huge walls of speakers and having
to search to find your friends (whom I tried to convince in vain to check
out F&F) in the sea of dancers. The music when I came in was solid acid.
Garth came on shortly thereafter and played some slightly funky hard house.
I was surprised at how high the vibe was considering the number of people
there. I certainly never expected to see something like that in 1994. 1991
in LA maybe.

Big problem - $25. Pure greed. Sure, they spent some cash on the show - the
lighting alone was probably $10k estimated a friend of mine who works for
Impact - but $25?!? Even more ludicrous when I found out Kevin Saunderson
wasn't there.

I headed back to F&F shortly after 3, where the energy and heat had grown
exponentially since I had left. The walls were damp with condensation and
the floor wet with sweat. Despite the difference in numbers, the vibe and
energy were about equal with FTT, with people whooping at every acid
buildup. One thing I noticed was that the crowd at F&F was quite a bit more
heterogenous than you usual club or even rave crowd. There was a welcome
diversity in dress, age, race, and gender (preference, too). Another plus
were the freebies being handed out at F&F.

The music got progressively harder and faster in the big room, which wasn't
really my cuppa but people were going off to it, and that's what counts. It
was especially cool because it's rare to hear harder stuff spun anywhere.

The crowd thinned out quite a bit from 4-6, but quite a few stayed to the
end dancing and cheering.

Major props to Ethan & Bryce for organizing, promoting, setting up, and
seeding the vibe. It's the F&F's that are the foundation of the scene.

Someone did say "don't call yet" but it was very confusing.  It took
me a minute to absorb what was happening (basically, a second group
of people to confirm the story).  The Pacific people did not have a
phone - that is what they told me.  I said a few times that we need
to find a phone.  From the timing of what Kathryn described I'd say
someone stopped the music and asked for a phone very soon after we
started to walk out to the parking lot.

Everyone acted fine under the circumstances, I'd say.
I hope your roomates are ok.

Gee, I'm sorry to hear that Mr. Strickland didn't "score."  I know just 
what he needs - EX lax!

But then again, religion is the opiate of the masses (and the rave masses).

a review:

I went to Zendada on Friday night.  It was starting on the
early side (12) which worked for me.  It was also only $5.
Jon Howard and Taj were excellent.  

favorite House sounds (House people)
powerful Bass Abstractions 

Folks are cool but friendly toward each other.
This goes with the large club territory.
It warms up when the last tourists are gone. 
Well, it warms up a little.  No one is interested
in much besides dancing - just Do Not Stop.
This party peaked after 4.  
The allnight crowd settled in and went off.
Everyone had a few hours of 'warm up' dancing (lucky us!) 
and I was a super-loose.  Every move was *such* a pleasure ...
BTW, I discovered strange new ways to move my ankles.  My ankles
really appreciated this, of course.



pre-mugging Sunset review:

I missed the most recent city party (Presidio) but heard from
from friends that it pulled a different crowd than the Berkeley 
parties.  I have to agree.  A bit monochromatic.  Unfortunate 
lack of dancing grandmas and little children.  Otherwise nice.

FRIENDS AND FAMILY FOUR WAS ONE OF THE BEST RAVES I HAVE *EVER* BEEN TO!!!!!!

The night of Oct 29 was probly one of the highlights of my life.  I just 
had the absolute fuckin best time.For anyone who wants 2 hear about it, 
here it goes:

	My friends & I arrived @ komotion at about 7:30.  Bryce, 
Sean(sp?), and a few others were still settin' up and we helped carry a 
few items in from the car.  This wuz the first time I had ever been to 
komotion and to be honest was quite shocked as 2 how small it wuz. "Oh 
well!" I decide, it will probly still B good.  I tend 2 prefer smaller 
vibier parties 2 huge events anyway. Unfortunately, my friends didn't 
share my opinion and convinced me to try out FTT.  We got to FTT at 
around 8 and stayed till about 9:20.  During that time the line didn't 
move AT ALL! BTW, off the subject, what is up with chargin' $25 for a 
rave?? Yeah, part of it was $15 but for that U had to arrive b4 nine 
oclock! Isn't that a bit early?  Isn't a 10 dollar jump in price abit 
much?? Especially since no one was let in b4 nine anyway??? We had 
encountered the same crap @ futur ($25 after 12).  I mean sure they spend 
a lot of cash, but from the amount of people there they make way more 
money!  Anyways, we had decided b4 not to pay $25, so when we found out 
that we couldn't get in for 15 we left and went back to FF4. We got back 
a little b4 10 oclock and the muzik was already on.No need 2 wait, we 
started dancin' right off. I cut open one of my glow sticks, and me and 
some girl put glo stuff in each others hair, but this didn't work very 
well at all(p.s. If U R readin this, what was your name? I completely 
forgot to ask U what it was!) Someone (it might've been sean, I don't 
quite remember) was passing around a whole box of blo pops.  This was 
*much* appreciated and from then on I just new the vibe here would B 
spectacular! The muzik also was hella good from the very start with 
Tamotsu(sp?) playin' a really cool set.  As more and more peeple arrived, 
the event just got better and better. Soon I popped a FAT hit of E that 
fuckin just rocked my world. The vibe here was the best I have seen in at 
least 2 years.  It reminded me of back when I had just started ravin.  
Everyone was all smiles and sooooooo friendly.  I met an incredible # of 
people at this rave and talked soooo much. Plenty of people had dressed 
up for Halloween (someone had even dressed up as a cop which scared me at 
first!).  Scores of people were handin out candy!  I go more candy there 
than I've ever gotten at a rave b4.  Everyone was just so unbelievably 
positive! Instead of many raves where I feel like I'm ravin' *around* 
others, here I felt that I was ravin *with* others.  Peeple were handin' 
out stickers and lots of peeple shared their toys with me.  The visuals 
were cool and I wondered what the videocamera was for.  If it was all 
videotaped I have got to have a copy.  I talked to Captin Crunch who I've 
seen at practicaly every single rave but have never spoken to till then. 
(If you R readin' this, U asked me to e-mail U but what was your address??)
Soon Bryce took over the turntables and played a hella cool set.  I think 
it was him who played master and servant.  Me and my best friend just 
went completely nuts (we *love* Depeche mode). What was that one song he 
played withe the sample "put it in"??  The dancefloor started getting 
*really* packed and *hot*. the fans helped some but not enough.  Not that 
the heat stopped me or anyone else.  Everyone continued jumpin around and 
dancin. Everyone was havin' such a good time I couldn't believe it! They 
were giving out free water and also chips and salsa (U guys filled my 
water bottle with *cold* water. THANK U!!!! I needed it bad!) Someone let 
me borrow their spray bottle and I danced around for a while sprayin 
everyone around me. They loved it being hot as they were altho I think I 
accidentally squirted the camera man. sorry! When Ethan came on he just 
TORE SHIT UP!!! He just played the most INSANE set! I went absolutely 
mental dancin to those hard poundin beats.  I just had to get my friends 
who were coolin' off outside, and dragged them back in to witness just 
how good the muzik was! They danced their asses off too.  I continued 
dancing for what seemed like an eternity. After a while tho my faces 
acshully started 2 hurt I was soo hot.(my friend said that my eyes were 
bulging outta my head and that I was acshully steamin'!!).  I took arest 
then started dancin again.  Even tho I was starting 2 get tired the muzik 
was just too good to resist!  I spotted Brian in his X-ing shirt and 
finally got 2 meet him after all that stuff I've read of his on the net.
The vibe was still hella up and even tho it was around 4 the place was 
still packed and people were still havin a wonderful time. I took a break 
outside around 4:30 but whe I came back in the heat was just too much to 
bear.  Also the muzik was a bit fast for that early in the mornin and I 
was kinda feelin nausious(sp?) from my E. So I left what had to have been 
the greatest experience.
	This is the first rave I've been to thrown by sfraves and I was 
just wonderin', was this night just an amazing exception or are all of 
your raves that good! I don't remember havin' that good a time in 
forever!  And all for only $3! Thanx guys soooo much for throwin such a 
good party.  No words can describe how good it was!  I think this might B 
my first post to sfraves(I've only been on for alittle over a week) so 
I'd love 2 hear from all of you that went (especially all the people I 
talked 2 at the rave). pleeze e-mail me.  I live in Davis THE most boring 
place in the world, and mail iz my only source of happiness here. Hope 2 
here from ya-

We got in for $15, and we were about 200th in line when it opened...
so they definitely let some people in for that price...
The also did a fairly good job of stopping people from bumping the 
queue.. (my pet peeve)

The place was like an airplane hangar.. and it was FULL of happy ravers...
Freezing at first but after a while the body heat started spreading... 
It reminded me of a massive WICKED...

The place was still half full at 7:30/8:00 AM when they closed down, 
really amazing! FTT did a shit hot job... :)

And of course... to make everyone's nite.. Carmen Miranda was there...
as well as the E-BEE :)   (Hope ur ear doesn't hurt milton :)

     SFRave crew,
     
     WOW! Its really sad to hear that Sunset ( and the last one, no less ) 
     ended on such a sour note. I hope that the people attacked are o.k. at 
     least.
     
     I agree with many people that $25 is waaay too much money for a rave. 
     I went to FTT about 8:30 ish. At first they didnt let us in for about 
     an hour, which sucked. However, they surprisingly *did* try to keep 
     people from cutting in line.. which appears to be a big problem these 
     days. Also, when they let us in ( about 9:45ish the line started 
     moving ), they charged us only $15! So it was great to see them keep 
     their end of the bargain up. Does anyone have any idea when they 
     started charging $25?
     
     As far as the rave goes, it was just spectacular. FTT really knows how 
     to throw a great *big* rave. It's everything Cool World -should- be! 
     3/4 of the whole warehouse was just throbbing with people getting off 
     to a great vibe! Wow! So many people! Lots of smiles and hugs. 
     Actually, for the record, I think Milton hugged half the crowd! :) I 
     really enjoyed Simon and Graeme's sets. Just intense!
     
     The best thing was at 8:30am, when the sun was up, lights were on, and 
     yet still about 300+ people still dancing their heads off! What a 
     great vibe! That made me get into it even more. Boy, with choices such 
     as F&FIV and FTT, its becoming hard to choose :) . Boy, am I glad I 
     live here, and not in Duluth or sm'thing! :)
     
     Well, rave on folks!
     
     Si Choudhury
     
     PS. Anyone know any cool people who are looking for a roomate from 
         December on, in Noe Valley...?  I figure it cant hurt to ask
         fellow SFRavers....

I also have to admit that I had the best time there.  Mike, Ryan, and I 
arrived at the rave around 11pm to hear Bryce finishing his set.  I got 
to hear a little bit of Laura spin "A-Dull-Vise".. but didn't hear much 
else.  The three of us were stuck in the main room just groovin' to the 
music.  Sean gave us some popsicles and other people gave us some candy.  
I saw Ethan in his pink with green polka dot boxers.  (What a easy way to 
stay cool.)  He spun a great set and it continued on after that.  You 
know the music's great when you have to close your eyes because the sweat 
is getting in your eyes!  Even Ryan, who never danced at a rave, danced.  
He said "Now I understand why you dance at raves!"  It made me feel 
good to hear that from him.  

After taking a little breather outside and talking with my friend Ryan, I 
got back in to hear the ending of one DJ and the start of Sean's.  Great 
music!  It seemed like almost a contest of who could dance the longest in 
front of the DJ.  The five or six people in front of the DJ's just kept 
on dancing and dancing.  I loved every second that Sean spun.  

After I just couldn't dance anymore, I made my way into the main room
again.  As I was watching the time lapse video of people shopping in a
grocery store, at a bank, industry... all the inventions of industry and
human endeavor I began to see how people were so machine like in this
video.  It made me think to see that raves were against being
machine-like.  I can't explain how I felt but the whole video got to me. I
saw how people related with each other, and with the earth.  It seemed
wrong to see industry.. For some reason, I felt the pain of what seemed
wrong and I began to cry.  I just cried and cried.  The world seemed so
wrong.  I kept on thinking, "It shouldn't be like this."

Aside from this serious moment, Friends & Family was a blast!  Everything 
I wanted at a rave: great people, caring promoters, free water & fruit, 
in-and-outs, huge fans, visuals, and great music... all made it a 
wonderful evening.

Mijo, this summer Carlos et al. did a good party series outdoors (equinox
and infinity) one with a map point and school bus, the other with a car
search. Neither was free (5-10$) but they were unbusted and there was no
violence, let alone tension. And they were blissful-smiley-happy-hoppy!

                Badges?!We don' need no stinkin' badges!

Security is not the only answer, and is not my favorite presence at a
party. Altho Falcon security (martin/FTT) has some pretty lenient, low
profile guys, and so does 1015 Folsom. Collar your dogs!

Lotsa love, 
 Milton and the E-Bee...

That was me :) and if you remember what I look like, introduce
yourself sometime! The blo-pops were provided by Maui
(ysh@netcom.com), who really *really* wanted to be there, give them
out, and send her love around, but she was so sick she had to stay
home :(.  Send her some hugs...

When I gave those out, about 10 till 10, I was on a contact high
already. From the smiles and the energy in the air, you could tell
people just *knew* something great was going to happen.

They've all been really good--the best parties I've been to.  And the
different parties have very delightfully different characters. The F&F
parties have all been like F&F4: insane yet friendly parties that take
off from minute one and kick ass all night :). And massive positive
energy at all of them, they make me smile so much my face hurts :).
Liquid parties have a more renegade feel, but are also really
friendly. I usually come away from these with about 10 new friends.
And of course at Liquid Drano, techno can happen :).  The SFR park
parties are just awesome, and have the feel of the better GG park
bandshell parties. And I don't know how much the New Moon crew wants
to be associated with SFR, but they're definitely part of the family,
and their ambient/dance renegades are nothing short of inspiring.

We've got a bunch of really fine people throwing these parties just
for the love of it, and I think that's why these parties turn out so
good. We want to make something beautiful happen, and it often does.
When you come in the door, you're not $20 to us, you're family.

I consider it a privilege to be associated with the people who work on
these parties and especially the people who attend them and give out
their good vibes.

Once again, it's _very_ rewarding to put your own personal energy into
a party and see it flourish. If you want to get more involved, ask to
help out! If nothing else, you'll meet some pretty insane people :).

Mosheh and Matt and I often have "micro-parties" in Davis; we have
some friends over and I play records and we watch Ren & Stimpy and
Beavis & Butthead tapes :). Send me some mail if you want us to let
you know next time we have one. If you spin, bring records! (Did I
mention black lights, strobes, a laser, and toys? We usually have
those, too :))

Acshully, I did introduce myself.  I was one of the 5 people who stopped 
by komotion at around 7:30. You introduced yourself to me (that's how I 
knew your name!) Later on, I was the guy walkin around with a red glo 
stick (my name is Vlad BTW)

Well, I *was* gonna help out. I got e-mail from Ethan sayin' that if I 
was gonna help, that I should show up around 6 but because of parents and 
other crap I wasn't able 2 make it till 7:30.  I helped U guys carry a 
few things in but my friends *really* wanted 2 check out FTT so I had 2 
leave for a while. Next time, I really want to help out a lot so count me 
in for help! Speakin' of next time, how often do you throw these parties?

I wouls absolutely *love* 2 go. pleeze let me know when you'll have 
another one.  I don't really spin, but lately I have started buyin' 
records and made the commitment of buyin' 2 a week (not much but 
the amount of money I have is low!) Most of the tunes I have R 
pretty phat tho and I'd be glad to bring them.  Also I can bring 
a black light, toys, and glo in the dark paint.
Thanx so much for responding to my letter! I hope 2 hear from ya again soon!

I'm so glad to hear theat F&F IV was a hit.  I unfortunately have been
working 1 and a half jobs lately, and Brian has been working the
equivalent of three jobs, so both of us were very tired and left soon
after I finished my set.

I must admit that I had *fun* being completely unapologetically cheezy
in the front room.  I wanted to do something different, and so I did :-)
I feel like a whole new world has opeened up to me in a way . . . I realized
I can spin hardcore, I can spin acid, I can spin trance, I can 
spin bizzare funny cheezoid stuff, and now I'd like to try ambient
some time.  It's very freeing to break the pigeon holes we put ourselves
in, no?


So anyway, THANKS everyone who came, especially to those who stuck with me
on my trip through some of the more obnoxious dance tracks of the late 80's.

Hugs,

Laura

Hmm sorry to hear about the violence at the Sunset party.

 i had a great time dancing tho to Galen (rockin my dancin' world) 
and Simon (?) i think who was after him. I had a smile just
from having so much fun dancing.
 left a bit after sunset so didnt know about the gangstas and
all that. shit like that just leaves you pissed that people can be
like that. its just fucked. period.

  people were cool and nice also. however comparted to the F&F party
the night before i didnt feel the friendly vibe was as open.
 but look at what im comparing it to! :)

peace

p.s - if gabe ( i think thats his name) puts together the film he
 has and shows it could someone please tell me? i can belive it'll
 be amazing.

i suppose that more bitterness will change things-right or maybe smiling 
at the thugs and asking them to join the party would help??

No way-why are you hassling-her she has the right idea we need to stick 
together. Its gettin ugly outside and the more people with love in the 
hearts stick together the better off things will be. i am not saying deny the 
fact of anger/hate/violence. i am saying find ways to get out of the way of 
its roaring head.. The day of the upright apes with guns is gettin old. Maybe 
you think violence is a normal way to act and should be accepted. i think it 
is a poor excuse for not being able use enough of your brain to keep up with 
the rest of us..

later

Forgive my brashness, but have you just arrived on this planet?  Our society
has so "class"ified itself that certain people and groups of people are
just doing their job (or what is expected of them).  What better targets
than the peaceful loving ones?  Sorry they jolted you back to reality, but
your peaceful vibes in the wilderness aren't gonna change a thing.

that word can only subtley sums up that night...although, I lost $45 (put it
in my shoe and when I reached for it not 5 min. after I put it there...LOST
IT)  From all the friendly people I talked to, to all the people who helped
put this "little" party on...What can I say but THANK YOU!  You helped make
this the single best rave I've been to.  It was extremely hard for me today
to come back to reality when I went to classes today.  I felt like I was in
another world...it sucked!  Vlad, Ethan, and phuture  I met and to the others
who aren't on sfraves but talked to...you are all incredible people. Rave
on...
