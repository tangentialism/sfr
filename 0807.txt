Which I don't. 

Also since the federal governments doesn't accept the validity of California's law and since the state maintains (insecurely) a list of everyone that purchases marijuana from a club, seems to me that you're just putting yourself on a list for later harassment or even arrest.

Feel free to correct me or simply  recommend a doctor to visit for my terrible insomnia ;)

To butcher a quote from the opening of Apocalypse Now:

"Citing someone for arson at BurningMan was like handing out speeding 
tickets at the Indy 500".

Ick.  Guy's a bit of a nutjob, he likely needs psychological treatment, 
but not jail, and definitely not 4 years of it.

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant house
every 1st Saturday at The Endup


featuring from Stockholm via Los Angeles:

MIKAEL STAV=D6STRAND   ** LIVE PA **

Sunset Diskos . We Are . Adjunct . Kindisch . Force Inc
Get Physical . Spectral . Mo's Ferry . Contexterrior

The madness rages on as [KONTROL] completes our three
month Swedish trifecta with Stockholm label owner, producer,
and exhilarating live performer Mikael Stav=F6strand.  His long
and highly respected career has seen thirty 12" and nineteen
full album releases on many of the world's top labels, ranging
from his early experimental and industrial works to the deep,
dark, and funky dancefloor grooves he's known for today.
Often cited as a standout of last year's Decibel Festival, don't
miss his much anticipated SF debut!


and from St. Louis via Berlin:

BUTANE

Alphahouse . Dumb-Unit . Rrygular . Num . Siteholder
Esperanza . Mo's Ferry . Foundsound . Freak n' Chic

Andrew Rasse helped put St. Louis on the global techno map
with his successful Alphahouse label and infamous parties of
the same name before defecting to Berlin a few years ago.
As a producer, his tracks have been a staple of the top jocks
on the planet, but anyone who's heard him spin will tell you
that it's his dynamic and seamless DJ sets you don't want to
miss.  Expect everything from warm, cerebral house to face-
melting peak hour techno from one of the State's finest exports.

MIKAEL STAV=D6STRAND  (aka The Skull, Bulgur Brothers, Vita)

Mikael Stav=F6strand was born in Stockholm, Sweden 1972, and is now
based in Berlin, Germany.  He has been lauded as a key figure of the
Swedish electronic music scene for his unique interpretations of
minimal club techno as well as for producing some of the most
essential experimental electronic music of the past years. Stav=F6strand
mixes deconstructed sounds with funky little beats to create minimal
dance textures. On his debut album on Force Inc., "Reduce", swarms of
glitches, crackles and skips infiltrate the 4/4 drive formula of
minimal techno. As Vita, his "Vita" 12" on Force Inc. imprint Force
Labs was welcomed by critical praise and became one of the best
selling releases with its digitalized organic groove.

He started to produce music in the early nineties, but back then he
was a part of the industrial scene and released some now labeled as
"classic" records under different names. Lately due to a lot of demand
from different labels, he agreed to allow reissues of these early
works.  After that period he got more interested into sound research
and minimalism, which also led to a couple of CD releases on labels as
Staalplaat in The Netherlands to name a few. In 2000 he became more
focused on bringing his experiences and sound from the pure minimal
scene into a more club context, so he started to work with minimal
techno sounds, which immediately resulted in releases on Force Inc. in
Germany. He has released 30 12" Ep's and 19 Albums (CD, DLP, LP) so
far and he has been featured on many compilation records. He is also a
sought after as a remix artist.

In recent years he has been playing live around the world at such
events as Mutek in Canada and in Mexico and Swedish Style in Tokyo. He
has also played in Japan and all over Europe at respected clubs such
as Panorama Bar, Weekend, Watergate, Fuse, Otto Zuts, Cargo,
Brancaleone and many more. He is often asked by Swedish Cultural
Institutes to represent Sweden abroad at festivals (ex. Detali Zvuku
in Kiev, Take me to Sweden in Berlin and Swedish Style in Tokyo).

Between 2000 to 2007 he ran the record label Mitek. Mitek's aim was to
produce and promote upcoming Swedish talents in the field of
electronic music. In the years Mitek produced 22 records with
different kinds of electronic music, from avant-garde to club. Mitek
often received grants from The Swedish Art Council to produce the
records.  In the summer of 2006 he also started his new label "Sunset
Diskos". This label is purely for club music and deep, funky minimal
tunes are the aim here. With artists such as himself, [a]pendics
shuffle, agaric & Bulgur Brothers, Pheek and Franco Cinelli.  Now he
is signed by Get Physical [DE], Spectral Sound [US], We Are [SE],
Sushitech [UK], Thema [US] and others, with more exciting prospects on
the way soon.

Recently he licensed tracks for Audion's Fabric mix CD, a new mix CD
by James Holden, Circo Loco @ DC10 CD in Mixmag March issue and Fuse
presents Steve Bug mix CD plus upcoming mix CD's by Agoria, Steve Bug
and MANDY. His music is heavily played by DJ's as Matthew Dear, MANDY,
Ricardo Villalobos, DJ T, Ryan Elliot, Jeff Samuel, Tanya Vulcano,
Marco Carola, Dinky, Butane, Jeff Milligan, Troy Pierce, Magda and Jay
Haze to name a few.

BUTANE

Label owner of Alphahouse Records, accomplished producer, and jet
setting DJ, Butane (Andrew Rasse) hails from the Midwestern United
States, the birthplace of many great electronic music acts. His
infamous Alphahouse monthly party put St. Louis on the current
worldwide techno map, and his record label is regarded as one of the
premier minimal techno/house labels in North America.

As a DJ, Andrew uses vinyl, Traktor Scratch, samplers, effects, and
whatever other new tools are available to craft his sets. Plenty of
experience in clubs enables him to move bodies while simultaneously
keeping a distinctly heady vibe. Technically gifted, with an ear for
deepness, and not afraid to take the crowd where they need to go, he
prides himself on playing appropriately for any time or setting.
Because of this musical range, expect anything from seamlessly blended
groovy, sexy, peak-time techno to warm, deep, cerebral house music.

As a music producer, his tracks have been featured on some of the
world's most forward-thinking underground labels.  Licensing original
tracks to mix compilations such as Matthew Dear's Fabric mix,
Luciano's HiFi SciFi on Soma, and Damian Lazarus' Get Lost mix, it's
obvious that his peers in the industry hold his music in high regard.

Always one to rely on his talents for success rather than shameless
promotional methods, Andrew remains increasingly busy on the
international DJ circuit. His touring schedule in the past year has
included gigs in Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Cape Town, Moscow,
Mexico City, London, Melbourne, Sydney, Budapest, Rome, Barcelona,
Detroit, New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, among many others. Rave
reviews of his sets continue to pour in from underground outposts
around the globe.

I don't mind paying an extra $5 per bag of weed if it means I can smoke it
wherever I want without fear and not have to put my name on a
government-owned list.  And above that, I'm willing to pay a little extra
money to get high if it means progress towards legality on the federal
level, which this might eventually prompt.  I'd just really like to know
what they're proposing to do with all this new revenue.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Can't beleive no one has commented on the BM trial outcome...

So what impact will this have on the event?    

I increasingly see the people that make the art being disillusioned with Burning Man for various reasons.  Many people I know (and they are the ones making some of the best art on the playa) don't go anymore.  Some actively bitch about the old days etc., but most simply don't bother to go and aren't interested in the politics.  I have to imagine that the quality of the art has and will continue to suffer as these individuals are replaced by RVs full of frat boys and their faux burner barbie girlfriends.  

I'm saddened by the sentencing of Mr. Addis, who seems like he is
troubled and for some reason is willing to make a martyr of himself (pleading guilty) to prove the point
about what BM has become.  I think he's made a huge mistake here, as
uncovering the falsehood of the myth associated with Burning Man simply wasn't
ever worth ruining his life over.  But now its too late for that.  He's fucked royally. 

As an outsider maybe my opinion doesn't matter much.  I've never been to BM, but over the years my interest in going to the event has waned.  And after hearing about these events I doubt that I'll ever go.  This story just confirms what I've thought for a while now, that Burning Man as a counter culture symbol has been totally commodified and absorbed into the mainstream consumerist American culture.  

That doesn't mean that Burning Man isn't a fun music and art festival like Coachella or Glastonbury or whatever, but that's all it is.   I'm just as unmotivated to go to Coachella as Burning Man.  The supposed community and counter culture principles of the event have now been shown clearly to be merely marketing hype and brand/lifestyle indicators intended to promote the business that is Burning Man LLC.  And like many other business, the LLC  decide to minimize the financial impact of these events on the business and to ensure that the business was not harmed in the future.  I don't see an evidence of considering the impact on the community or their so called principles.  Totally expected for a business, but not for a radical counter culture social revolution.

I ask therefore, will 2008 be the last Burning Man?  And will Addis' actions be the trigger that ended it?  

After reading Chicken John's and other's postings over on Laughing Squid, I have to wonder if the LLC isn't giving Mr. Addis exactly what he wanted by allowing his prosecution: the death of the LLC in an implosion of hypocrisy and greed.

Peace,

Peter

PS I predict ClearChannel will make an offer to buy out the BM LLC in 2009. Stay Tuned.

To butcher a quote from the opening of Apocalypse Now:

Ick.  Guy's a bit of a nutjob, he likely needs psychological treatment, 
but not jail, and definitely not 4 years of it.

I love burning things, no doubt.

But I don't set things on fire with unsuspecting people inside.  I 
don't see why this guy should ever see sunshine again.

There were people inside?  I haven't seen that reported anywhere.  Reports I've read state there were some people below the man and that there was plenty of warning that the man was on fire.  Do you have a reference to back the statement that anyone was inside the Man itself?

There's no doubt that Mr. Addis had bad judgment here, very bad judgment, but based on what I know the claims of significant danger to others are totally baseless.

I love burning things, no doubt.

But I don't set things on fire with unsuspecting people inside.  I 
don't see why this guy should ever see sunshine again.

Since a friend was someone who was having him stay at their place for 
some time, I can say that's an accurate statement.  I can also try to 
have any other specific questions anyone may have about Paul and the 
situation answered.

(I haven't read the rest of the thread's responses, so I'll assume 
someone may have helped you out here.  If not, I'll try to get you a 
recommendation.)

It's an interesting world you seem to be living in.  You're saying 100%

Subject: RE: [sfraves] No more prescriptions, but a state tax...I'm in!

For me this is about California recognizing bud for more than just medical
reasons. Recreational use opens a huge range of possible lifestyle changes
for residents:

-Smoking in public (without fear)
-Cafes and Chef Spealities
-Drive Throughs (can only image visitors from other states)
-Home gardening and cultivation
-More THC Edibles
-Availablity in Night Life Bars/Clubs
-Stress Balancing with the over-worked, more pysch studies
-Open discussions with Family members and public forums

These are the only ones I can imagine, I'm sure it will grow beyond that. I
would hope that local law enforcement would be able to tell when one is high
while driving or other heavey machine operating (Humboldt has a swab test to
detect usage upto 12hrs ago).

Sure its been legal The Netherlands for a while, but combine legality with
capalist society...itll get crazy.

I don't mind paying an extra $5 per bag of weed if it means I can smoke it
wherever I want without fear and not have to put my name on a
government-owned list.  And above that, I'm willing to pay a little extra
money to get high if it means progress towards legality on the federal
level, which this might eventually prompt.  I'd just really like to know
what they're proposing to do with all this new revenue.

I'm sorry, I forgot, you were there, I wasn't.  Oh wait.

There weren't people inside the man any more than there are people 
inside your dishwasher.  that's not what I said.  The super-structure 
the man sits on, that forms the base, and everything underneath it, 
contained people.  this also burned.

For me this is about California recognizing bud for more than just medical
reasons. Recreational use opens a huge range of possible lifestyle changes
for residents:

-Smoking in public (without fear)
-Cafes and Chef Spealities
-Drive Throughs (can only image visitors from other states)
-Home gardening and cultivation
-More THC Edibles
-Availablity in Night Life Bars/Clubs
-Stress Balancing with the over-worked, more pysch studies
-Open discussions with Family members and public forums

These are the only ones I can imagine, I'm sure it will grow beyond that. I
would hope that local law enforcement would be able to tell when one is high
while driving or other heavey machine operating (Humboldt has a swab test to
detect usage upto 12hrs ago).

Sure its been legal The Netherlands for a while, but combine legality with
capalist society...itll get crazy.

I don't mind paying an extra $5 per bag of weed if it means I can smoke it
wherever I want without fear and not have to put my name on a
government-owned list.  And above that, I'm willing to pay a little extra
money to get high if it means progress towards legality on the federal
level, which this might eventually prompt.  I'd just really like to know
what they're proposing to do with all this new revenue.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Can't beleive no one has commented on the   BM trial outcome...

IMO I don't need to have been there to see the injustice of sending a
mentally disturbed person to jail for years for what is really just an act of vandalism. 

As I wrote earlier
today, I think BM LLC is giving Addis exactly what he wanted which seems to be
the martyr and bring the LLC down with him.  And through arrogance,
greed, or maybe just stupidity, they are playing the role of the selfish evil empire he set up for
them to play.  That's a very unfortunate choice IMO.  This decision might very well spell the end of the event.  Or maybe not.

Your description doesn't seem me to be in conflict with the multiple and varied sources I've read today which state no one was endangered.  It seems to be a matter of personal interpretation about how much danger there really was.  Since no more serious charges were filed (i.e. attempted manslaughter) I'm going to go out on a limb and claim that the danger was in fact rather limited.

And just exactly what constitutes endangering someone at Burning Man?  Was the early burn any more dangerous than thousands of other things that have happened on the playa over the years?  I personally doubt that given some of things I have heard from friends that have been at many burns.  

Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury...

Regards, 

Peter

I'm sorry, I forgot, you were there, I wasn't.  Oh wait.

There weren't people inside the man any more than there are people 
inside your dishwasher.  that's not what I said.  The super-structure 
the man sits on, that forms the base, and everything underneath it, 
contained people.  this also burned.

I don't really see what the big deal is.  I think it was pretty fuckin funny
that he burned the man early.  it was pretty good timing too with the full
moon lunar eclipse.  He lit it up at just the right time, it was rather
spectacular.  The monday night burn was much more amazing than the pussy job
that took at least a half hour on saturday the "official burn".

And about the people who were underneath the man

there's this disclaimer on the burning man ticket that goes

"YOU VOLUNTARILY ASSUME THE RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH BY ATTENDING AND
RELEASE BURNING MAN FROM ANY CLAIMS FROM THIS RISK" and continues in
detail.

basically, its not BRC's job to hold your fucking hand

you're in the desert

drink water

watch out for falling fire

and other dangers


I'm pretty suprised though, I would think BRC wouldn't have pressed
charges.  I don't see the big deal anyways

I don't believe they had a choice.  Their choice was in whether to go 
for the jugular of claiming damages that fall above or below the felony 
level, thus determining his fate.

i've spent 8 years at burning man, which is less than some but enough to gain a bit of perspective, and i agree completely with the statements below. count me amongst those who no longer feel any draw towards what has been reduced to just another big party.

let's be real here though - this isn't the first time burning man has endured a mass exodus and i'm sure it won't be the last. there are more than enough bros and fur bunnies and vegas cheesedicks to sustain the event financially for a long time to come. i doubt addis reached anyone who didn't already at least partially agree with his position, and i hardly think this signals the beginning of the end. this is just another weird art project whose memory will be lost in the comedown. if i believed burning man was actually creating anything lasting or meaningful in its current state, i'd still be in attendance.

love,
mo

most simply don't bother to go and aren't interested in the politics. 
 
This story just confirms what I've thought for a while now, 
that Burning Man as a counter culture symbol has been totally commodified 
and absorbed into the mainstream consumerist American culture.  

That doesn't mean that Burning Man isn't a fun music and art festival 
like Coachella or Glastonbury or whatever, but that's all it is.

Subject: [sfraves] Burning Man

2007 was the worst BM I've seen - the art was not up to what it was 
in the past, the X shortage had everyone uptight, the relentless 
daily dust storms. So what? We'll be there again this year.

I kind of like all the middle class RVers, gearheads, hollywood 
doofuses, locals, and Indians coming to BM. Who the hell wants to 
hang out in a candyrave art-school ghetto? Gimme real people, thank 
you... (Well, yeah, fuck the frat-boys.)

Reports of BMs demise are premature. It is what it is. Eventually it 
will be killed, but it ain't dead yet. Last year we took people who 
had never been who claimed it was life-changing. I figure if the 
worst BM ever could do that, it will have a long way to fall before it dies.

If you refuse to go because it "just isn't cool enough anymore", it 
defaults to the assholes. It is still worth going to. It will have to 
suck a lot more than it does now to keep me away.

It's a party. Lighten up.

if you look at the subject line, you'll notice some text that says
"NRR". this means "not rave related" and it's in the subject line of
any topic that's about anything other than raves. if you set up your
filters to put all the NRR stuff in a different folder, you should be
left with just the ravetastic rave emails :)

It was when I started having friends, who I respected, have the first 
words they used to describe BM to those who haven't been be along the 
lines of "it's a great party" that I knew the event was I respected was 
on the decline.  For me, the party aspect was the icing on the cake. 
The cake itself has dried up a while ago, it seems.

Subject: Re: NRR: Re: [sfraves] Burning Man

Points well taken! After last year I said I was through going, but a 
little time healed that. You may well be right about the frat-boy 
faux fur alcohol disaster waiting to happen. I sure hope not, which 
is one reason I'll continue to go, probably too many times - I'll 
quit a year or two later than I should...

Didn't mean to imply that it is your "responsibility to maintain the 
quality of the BM event or audience either by attending or not 
attending the Burn." I just figure if we leave early we may just hurt 
ourselves. I really don't know. Again, point well taken, and you may 
be right. As Yogi Berra once said of some place or another "Nobody 
goes there anymore - it's too crowded."

I'm not really up on all the politics of the LLC and their profit or 
whether this is exploiting those of us who go to give freely. I've 
heard a fair amount about it, but don't really feel informed on the 
issues, so you may be right. I just figure I'm going to give and not 
expect anything in return, and that's just part of what it is about. 
Of course I'm not putting up some multi-thousand dollar art project, 
just sharing what I have.

Takers will always be out there, but I'm not going to let them take 
my humanity by sucking me into the balance sheet view of life. So I 
get exploited by a few takers - what else is new? At least I'll keep 
my humanity...

You may well be right about all of it. I hope not. Anyway, whatever 
you choose, I'll send my Respect! But I'll be sorry not to see you 
there, whoever you are - one fewer of us to make it happen.

If somebody throws a rave, and nobody shows up, is there any dancing?

Thank you all for all you do - thanks to everyone who comes together 
to make our thing happen, whenever and wherever. As long as we make 
love, get high, and dance, everythang's gonna be all right. That's 
all I care about... I'm no DJ or promoter or anything at all - I just 
wanna dance...

Best Wishes,

--David

Thanks for bringing this up - I've been wanting to suggest a separate 
event announcement list for those of us who just want to know where 
to dance, and so the DJs could continue their conversations here.

The "NRR" suggestion from mo is great. Thanks!

well.. the SFR calendar still works just that nobody manages it or posts 
to it. i would hit up whoever is running this rusting hulk of an e-mail 
list these days and volunteer if you have the time to be an admin for 
the calendar list. if there was a managed list, i would sign up 
immediately.

this might be an appropriate time to also mention the calendar and events
list over at blipswitch.com.

the site is geared mainly towards techno and other 4/4 bizness, but any
events are welcome.  i don't really have anything to do with the site, but i
did volunteer to moderate the events section.

its also a nice (if small) little community of techno fans, DJs, promoters
and such, and gets a decent (but not obnoxious) amount of posting action.
also some nice mixes posted for free download, chatter about gear, etc.

check it out and feel free to sign up and join in, it's growing by the day
and we're are hoping to make it a resource for all flavors of raveyness.

Only thing is that I think that the process of:
1. logging in to a forum
2. clicking on links to navigate a forum's messages
3. clicking on links to post to a forum
is SUCH a waste of time.  (Thus why I generally don't participate in web 
based forums.)  I don't have that time to waste.

Now if it becomes as efficient as utilizing an email list, count me in.

Looks like fine content however.  I don't even see an rss feed.  Sad I 
won't be taking part. :(

SFgoth fixed this problem a long time ago...

One list, two types of subs.

SFG-  Just like SFR

SFG-A  Announce only.  All posts made by SFG-A go to SFG by default, but 
not the other way.

Yep, I've seen many multiple level lists,

moderated/edited: The moderators periodically post a newsletter/blast with
summary info.  copies to:

news/announce: for announcements only, violations subject to bans, copies
to: 

discussion/anything goes.  These can even be 2 levels.

People sub at the level of noise they want and get everything above.

Can work, but if not done carefully, can lead to a lot of resentment over
people taking so much liberty with the "open" list at the end that they
end up driving everyone off and killing the topic-related discussion too.

-R.

Good idea.  It can be done, but...

you can do this with one list, that's what the subject tags are for.

all the announcements have BSP: in the subject line, so you could 
start out by filtering out everything that doesn't.

I used to work for this company called Soundflavor, which was attempting to
creating a music search engine and music recommendation software that worked
with musical qualities that we music "experts" who worked there determined.
 Sort of like Pandora. I was their electronic music specialist. It was a
cool job, I had fun, but they laid me off when things started to slide
downhill.  Ahh startups....
Anyway, why I am telling you guys about Soundflavor now is this -  I just
found out from a former co-worker that the company is going belly-up for
good in about a month.  Soundflavor's website, soundflavor.com, is a huge
resource for free music, a lot of which is actually pretty good. Since the
company is dead, I assume that the website will be coming down really soon,
along with all the free tunes.  I highly recommend you check out the site
and grab some music while it's still there.

You can browse by genre, and while it's not perfect, most of the
classifications on the site should be halfway decent - I personally
classified a lot of the electronic stuff while I was working there.  As I
recall, there was a lot of good tech-house, a ton of progressive, some
minimal and dubby techno, I seem to remember a lot of acid breaks coming in
too.  On the main page, click on the button that says Free Songs, then from
there you can browse by genre and subgenre, tempo, year recorded,
instruments, or tell it a song that you like and it will find other tracks
it thinks sound similar.  It's worth checking out - www.soundflavor.com

Love Chelsea

it's just like house music, except if you try to dance to it you'll spill your drink.

that's why the techno heads just sit around the DJ booth and trainspot.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] How do i get just rave event info emails only?

This calendar discussion seems to come up a few times a year. 
What we're missing is for someone to volunteer, spearhead, and 
follow through with their idea.

I can code up something simple if someone has an idea but no way 
to implement it. Brian's idea was a wiki. Perhaps we could even 
do a blog, (takes care of the RSS).

Dunno, we have resources here. Just not anyone(s) to follow 
through with it.

Contact me if you're interested.

Supposedly DJ Bone released a limited CD of tracks as Sect1 without 
telling anyone who it was that produced them. There was a mystery 
surrounding who until it was revealed some time later.

Heres a stream of them.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: CNN declares magic mushrooms 'spritually enlightening' according
 to Johns Hopkins study.

http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/health/2008/07/02/costello.magic.mushroom.cnn

this is everything short of an endorsement if you ask me. they feature 
Tim Leary alot in this i've always felt that Leary gave psychedelics a 
bad spin. i would say any crazy bastard who takes two teaspoons of LSD 
in one sitting shouldn't be a spokesperson for anything. its amazing 
people are actually looking into psychoactive research seriously 
again... after leary spooked the world with 'tune in turn & drop out' 
and helped set serious research back about fifty years IMHO. there's 
hope in the world again.

Yeah- Ryan is straight up techno. And schranz. He produces a lot of Schranz too. Actually, he's the only Schranz producer (that I know of) in North America, but usually he'll drop acid techno when he plays out.

Subject: [sfraves] That '78 Minna' DnB Vibe??

Mmmm...yes, Eklektic, tasty dnb, rewinds, Rinse, Flux, Jamalski...

Does that vibe exist anywhere now?  Is that genre of dnb spun out anywhere?  What would that be called?

Some may hate on me, but I love the simplicity that kemal and rob data brought to the dancefloor...I miss those tunes.

The last dnb party that I went to had me sit and appreciate the complexity of the music rather than stomping and waving my beer like a madman.

feel me?

fable....

just out of curiosity, what sources are you guys typically consulting for
your party info?  (sfraves doesnt count) ;P   in other words, Ray, when you
say you haven't seen much "online promo" what does that exactly mean? WHERE
haven't you seen it?  i've personally seen it alot on myspace, but then
again i'm friends with a few people that are playing, so go figure.

By the way, I'd like to formally posit that the subject line of the original post is an oxymoron.

Actually, I haven't seen much promo in general for this event, given how
many DJs I know are on the roster.  In terms of online, what I mean is that
I typically see a half dozen or more mentions of a given event over various
lists, plus various websites, and lots of myspace mentions of said events.
For this, I've seen mentions from David Javate, Alland and Amber.

It's one of those things; if we only ever promote to our friends, we end
up with some pretty small parties.  Admittedly, you probably have a lot
more friends than I do, but I'm pretty sure that with parties you throw,
for example, you reach out to a lot more people than just them.  Like that
one I think you're throwing this Saturday, I bet at least a few people you
and the other guys have never met know about it. ;-)  Sure, you and the
kontrol crew probably do a better job promoting than almost any other
party in the city, but there's a lot of room between how much I've seen
for the nextaid benefit and that.

Given that it's for a particular cause, I'm also rather surprised there
hasn't been more noise from other folks who believe in NextAid, also.

stuck at work instead of killswitch,

Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well  
tried before you give them your confidence. True friendship is a plant  
of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity  
before it is entitled to the appellation.

- George Washington

my guess is no

berk's largely being rebuilt.  old, abandoned warehouses have been 
torn down.  empty good spaces have new businesses in them.  wine.com 
is located in berk, takes up a full block.

The madness rages on as [KONTROL] completes our three

and exhilarating live performer Mikael Stav=F6strand.  His long
and highly respected career has seen thirty 12" and nineteen
full album releases on many of the world's top labels, ranging
from his early experimental and industrial works to the deep,
dark, and funky dancefloor grooves he's known for today.
Often cited as a standout of last year's Decibel Festival, don't
miss his much anticipated SF debut!

As a producer, his tracks have been a staple of the top jocks
on the planet, but anyone who's heard him spin will tell you
that it's his dynamic and seamless DJ sets you don't want to
miss.  Expect everything from warm, cerebral house to face-
melting peak hour techno from one of the State's finest exports.

MIKAEL STAV=D6STRAND  (aka The Skull, Bulgur Brothers, Vita)

Mikael Stav=F6strand was born in Stockholm, Sweden 1972, and is now based i=
n
Berlin, Germany.  He has been lauded as a key figure of the Swedish
electronic music scene for his unique interpretations of minimal club techn=
o
as well as for producing some of the most essential experimental electronic
music of the past years. Stav=F6strand mixes deconstructed sounds with funk=
y
little beats to create minimal dance textures. On his debut album on Force
Inc., "Reduce", swarms of glitches, crackles and skips infiltrate the 4/4
drive formula of minimal techno. As Vita, his "Vita" 12" on Force Inc.
imprint Force Labs was welcomed by critical praise and became one of the
best selling releases with its digitalized organic groove.

He started to produce music in the early nineties, but back then he was a
part of the industrial scene and released some now labeled as "classic"
records under different names. Lately due to a lot of demand from different
labels, he agreed to allow reissues of these early works.  After that perio=
d
he got more interested into sound research and minimalism, which also led t=
o
a couple of CD releases on labels as Staalplaat in The Netherlands to name =
a
few. In 2000 he became more focused on bringing his experiences and sound
from the pure minimal scene into a more club context, so he started to work
with minimal techno sounds, which immediately resulted in releases on Force
Inc. in Germany. He has released 30 12" Ep's and 19 Albums (CD, DLP, LP) so
far and he has been featured on many compilation records. He is also a
sought after as a remix artist.

In recent years he has been playing live around the world at such events as
Mutek in Canada and in Mexico and Swedish Style in Tokyo. He has also playe=
d
in Japan and all over Europe at respected clubs such as Panorama Bar,
Weekend, Watergate, Fuse, Otto Zuts, Cargo, Brancaleone and many more. He i=
s
often asked by Swedish Cultural Institutes to represent Sweden abroad at
festivals (ex. Detali Zvuku in Kiev, Take me to Sweden in Berlin and Swedis=
h
Style in Tokyo).

Between 2000 to 2007 he ran the record label Mitek. Mitek's aim was to
produce and promote upcoming Swedish talents in the field of electronic
music. In the years Mitek produced 22 records with different kinds of
electronic music, from avant-garde to club. Mitek often received grants fro=
m
The Swedish Art Council to produce the records.  In the summer of 2006 he
also started his new label "Sunset Diskos". This label is purely for club
music and deep, funky minimal tunes are the aim here. With artists such as
himself, [a]pendics shuffle, agaric & Bulgur Brothers, Pheek and Franco
Cinelli.  Now he is signed by Get Physical [DE], Spectral Sound [US], We Ar=
e
[SE], Sushitech [UK], Thema [US] and others, with more exciting prospects o=
n
the way soon.

Recently he licensed tracks for Audion's Fabric mix CD, a new mix CD by
James Holden, Circo Loco @ DC10 CD in Mixmag March issue and Fuse presents
Steve Bug mix CD plus upcoming mix CD's by Agoria, Steve Bug and MANDY. His
music is heavily played by DJ's as Matthew Dear, MANDY, Ricardo Villalobos,
DJ T, Ryan Elliot, Jeff Samuel, Tanya Vulcano, Marco Carola, Dinky, Butane,
Jeff Milligan, Troy Pierce, Magda and Jay Haze to name a few.

BUTANE

Label owner of Alphahouse Records, accomplished producer, and jet setting
DJ, Butane (Andrew Rasse) hails from the Midwestern United States, the
birthplace of many great electronic music acts. His infamous Alphahouse
monthly party put St. Louis on the current worldwide techno map, and his
record label is regarded as one of the premier minimal techno/house labels
in North America.

As a DJ, Andrew uses vinyl, Traktor Scratch, samplers, effects, and whateve=
r
other new tools are available to craft his sets. Plenty of experience in
clubs enables him to move bodies while simultaneously keeping a distinctly
heady vibe. Technically gifted, with an ear for deepness, and not afraid to
take the crowd where they need to go, he prides himself on playing
appropriately for any time or setting. Because of this musical range, expec=
t
anything from seamlessly blended groovy, sexy, peak-time techno to warm,
deep, cerebral house music.

As a music producer, his tracks have been featured on some of the world's
most forward-thinking underground labels.  Licensing original tracks to mix
compilations such as Matthew Dear's Fabric mix, Luciano's HiFi SciFi on
Soma, and Damian Lazarus' Get Lost mix, it's obvious that his peers in the
industry hold his music in high regard.

Always one to rely on his talents for success rather than shameless
promotional methods, Andrew remains increasingly busy on the international
DJ circuit. His touring schedule in the past year has included gigs in
Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Cape Town, Moscow, Mexico City, London,
Melbourne, Sydney, Budapest, Rome, Barcelona, Detroit, New York, Los
Angeles, and Chicago, among many others. Rave reviews of his sets continue
to pour in from underground outposts around the globe.

Britain's erstwhile rave culture

In 1988, Thatcher=92s Britain was hit by an almighty day-glo wake-up =20
call: the birth of the acid-house party. Twenty years on, we remember =20=

the clothes, the drugs and the music =97 and asks how rave culture has =20=

shaped the way we live today
Kate Spicer

I was due on stage at 8am,=94 recalls the acid-house pioneer Trevor =20
Fung. =93It was a beautiful sunny morning. I=92d never seen so many =
people =20
in my life =97 there must have been 20,000 out there. There were three =20=

juggernauts in this huge field; two were piled with speakers. I got on =20=

the one in the middle with the decks on. I just walked on, waved, =20
dropped the needle on the record... and it all went off.=94

This was towards the end of the second summer of love, the name given =20=

to the period in 1988-89 when dance music, youth culture and a =20
generation=92s expectations of fun did, indeed, go off in a singular and =
=20
spectacular way. That summer of love was, for those who were there, a =20=

fortuitous collision of several cultural phenomena. There was the =20
little-known acid-house music coming out of Chicago. There was the =20
importing, by a group of young London DJs, of a very Ibizan way of =20
partying, with abandon and a total disregard for respecting the =20
boundaries around musical genres (and the little matter of the MDMA =20
they found there, which was a popular agent for their hedonism). With =20=

their passion for the music, they blew the existing free and illegal =20
warehouse party scene wide open, making it accessible to people more =20
used to the dire Hit Man and Her-style clubbing of Ritzy=92s, on the =20

"A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, "Universe," a  
part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts  
and feelings as something separated from the rest -- a kind of optical  
delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for  
us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few  
persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this  
prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living  
creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to  
achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in  
itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner

"The original FISA law was passed in 1978 after a thorough congressional
investigation headed by Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) revealed that for
decades, intelligence analysts -- and the presidents they served -- had
spied on the letters and phone conversations of union chiefs, civil rights
leaders, journalists, antiwar activists, lobbyists, members of Congress,
Supreme Court justices -- even Eleanor Roosevelt and the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. The Church Committee (Watergate) reports painstakingly documented
how the information obtained was often "collected and disseminated in order
to serve the purely political interests of an intelligence agency or the
administration, and to influence social policy and political action."

+Vote "YES" on the Dodd-Feingold amendment, which would strip telecom

+Vote "YES" on the Bingaman amendment, which would delay implementation of
telecom immunity until after Congress has received the Inspectors General

Unfortunately, Obama and McCain are both planning to vote for the final

I don't think there is evidence that Einstein considered himself a  
Buddhist.  However:


"Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic
religion of the future. It transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and
theology; it covers both the natural and spiritual, and it is based on a
religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and
spiritual, as a meaningful unity."

-Einstein

Discover magazine is doing the same thing. Unanticipated side effect
of Bush insanity. Mainstream went too far right, belatedly
self-correcting.

to add to this, i was listening to this new kind of radio show i have  
never heard of called the alex jones show.  he was interviewing  
someone who said we're brought up to believe that we are physical  
beings with an occasional spiritual experience, where actually, the  
opposite is true, we are spiritual beings with an occasional physical  
experience.

Good Morning SFR,

Hope everyone is in better shape this morning than I am!!!

Have you heard of Alex Grey? I just watched a DVD about his work this weekend called MindArt. This guy's philosophy is that if there is art which can depress the immune system, there is art which can heal & strengthen it as well. . . Pretty cool stuff! I must have watched his DVD like three (3) times! Amongst other works, he's done an album cover for Tool.

I'd HIGHLY recommend you run an image search on Google for Alex Grey if you haven't heard of him already. I've seen a lot of psychoactive artwork at parties that resemble his works, but nothing (IMHO) compares to the genuine article.

peace!

Chuck

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR:  THOUGHT

I would respond that perhaps you don't know what you are talking about. 

Many martial arts are grounded in Buddhism or Taoism and in some cases even contain hidden Buddhist and Taoist symbology.  That is the martial art encodes a teaching in its movements.  

Also its not an either or choice; you can practice both marital arts and meditation.  In my experience many martial arts instructors include some sitting meditation in their practices anyway.  

Finally, I'll just point out that sitting meditation is only one form of meditation and their are more active forms which include movement, in some cases movements derived from martial arts.

Peter

I almost forgot to mention that it is a mistaken view that meditation is just sitting around with a blank mind...most of the meditation I do requires active visualization of complex forms.  You have to memorize these forms from pictures and texts, and it takes extensive practice over time to do it accurately.  Its not anything like just "sitting around" as you state.

Not joking here: Do you listen to music when you meditate? Discuss. . .

I almost forgot to mention that it is a mistaken view that meditation is just
sitting around with a blank mind...most of the meditation I do requires active
visualization of complex forms.  You have to memorize these forms from pictures
and texts, and it takes extensive practice over time to do it accurately.  Its
not anything like just "sitting around" as you state.

I would respond that perhaps you don't know what you are talking about. 

Many martial arts are grounded in Buddhism or Taoism and in some cases even
contain hidden Buddhist and Taoist symbology.  That is the martial art encodes
a teaching in its movements.  

Also its not an either or choice; you can practice both marital arts and
meditation.  In my experience many martial arts instructors include some
sitting meditation in their practices anyway.  

Finally, I'll just point out that sitting meditation is only one form of
meditation and their are more active forms which include movement, in some
cases movements derived from martial arts.

Peter

Eight forces sustain creation:
Movement and stillness,
Solidification and fluidity,
Extension and contraction,
Unification and division.
-- Morihei Ueshiba (founder of the "martial art" Aikido) from The Art
of Peace


The Art of Peace does not rely on weapons or brute force to succeed;
instead we put ourselves in tune with the universe, maintain peace in
our own realms, nurture life, and prevent death and destruction. The
true meaning of the term samurai is one who serves and adheres to the power of
love.

I would say that about martial arts before buddhism, but I'd also say 
you'll find out more about your mind by testing it than by sitting 
around meditating.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: Alex Grey- MindArt

So what I'm wondering is what did the relentless gloomy skulls that 
were endlessly repeated on the screen at Mighty last Saturday do to us?

The promo card for this "For the Love of House" show was all rainbows 
and butterflies and flowers, so I remember thinking "Huh? What's up 
with the gloomy death imagery?"

Great DJs none the less! Had great time!

The greatest achievement is selflessness.
The greatest worth is self-mastery.
The greatest quality is seeking to serve others.
The greatest precept is continual awareness.
The greatest medicine is the emptiness of everything.
The greatest action is not conforming with the world's ways.
The greatest action is transmuting the passions.
The greatest generosity is non-attachment.
The greatest goodness is a peaceful mind.
The greatest patience is humility.
The greatest effort is not concerned with results.
The greatest meditation is a mind that lets go.
The greatest wisdom is seeing through appearances.

Subject: [SpAzLiSt] RIP DJ Tron

 

DJ Tron passed away on Friday from unknown causes but it was ruled an
"accident," whatever that means. He produced and DJed various forms of
hardcore and acid as well as made techno under the guise of "Demonslut." If
you were into that sort of thing, he was very popular in the late 90s. He
put out some excellent records and mixtapes over the years. Here's a link to
a few:

To clear things up for everyone, Jeff aka DJ Tron did NOT die from an
overdose. It has been determined as an accidental death as of now... Read
below.

DJ Tron was my best friend, mentor, brother and room mate. At 1:30 a.m. July
4th, 2008 Jeff was found in my studio completely unresponsive. At that time
peramedics were called and I attempted to perform CPR but was unsuccessful.
At 2:15 a.m. the hospital prenounced his death. I've been in close contatact
several times a day with his mother "Momma Tron" and she stated that after
the police performed a thorough investigation of the living premisis, and
DuPage county coroners office performed a preliminary medical examination,
his sudden death has been determined accidental. As with all accidential
deaths the coroners final report will be avalible in 8 to 10 weeks. They do
not anticipate any other findings. These rumors of overdose are hurtful to
his family and friends closest to him and should be stopped immediately per
Momma Tron.

Lets just knock off the shit and remember Jeff as our General in hardcore
and the possitive influance and leadership he has had on all of us in the
industry for over the past 15 years.

R.I.P

Jeff Tron

7/29/1973 - 7/4/2008

You haven't contradicted my view, or added any new information.

Subject: [sfraves] so how else can we promote?



As some of you may remember, I've been positing that the existing channels
of promotion simply aren't reaching enough people for quite some time now.

Just met someone online for other reasons, who would seem to be part of
this untapped audience:
> The city needs some more techno. Maybe step up the promotions if you can because seriously haven't heard about it! Dang and I'm like one of the 10 techno headz in SF buhaha. Just curious do you book lots of out of town DJs, or if it's locals could I ask who? I just so rarely hear of techno parties in SF and usually if I do it's the heavies Richie Hawtin, Magda, and if we're lucky one of the Detroit crew.

She's clearly paying attention to something because she knew about Hawtin,
but with all the other parties out there, how are we all missing the target?

Yes, I'm following up on her for multiple reasons, but how are we all missing
the boat here?

discuss. :)

there's tons of techno parties.  the job is also hers to keep
her ear to the ground and stay informed.

there's a bunch of techno e-mail lists.  i think greg bird has
a calendar.  there's tribe, (ugh) myspace, and (double ugh)
facebook.  hell, even *i'm* playing techno at a gig in two
weeks (this would be chuck g's "all funkin' night" party).

speaking of good techno, alex windsor dropped a sweet set on
7/4 at amnesia.

How about asking this person where they hear about parties?  When in doubt, ask a user.

Wait, weren't you the one arguing for the superiority of a specific technique? 

No recollection, no thinking, no thought.
No meditation, no examination.
But letting the mind be in its natural state.

Manifest yang In your right hand, Balance it with The yin of your left, And guide your partner.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Alex Grey- MindArt

Good Morning SFR,

Hope everyone is in better shape this morning than I am!!!

Have you heard of Alex Grey? I just watched a DVD about his work this weekend called MindArt. This guy's philosophy is that if there is art which can depress the immune system, there is art which can heal & strengthen it as well. . . Pretty cool stuff! I must have watched his DVD like three (3) times! Amongst other works, he's done an album cover for Tool.

I'd HIGHLY recommend you run an image search on Google for Alex Grey if you haven't heard of him already. I've seen a lot of psychoactive artwork at parties that resemble his works, but nothing (IMHO) compares to the genuine article.

peace!

Chuck

there's tons of techno parties.  the job is also hers to keep
her ear to the ground and stay informed.

there's a bunch of techno e-mail lists.  i think greg bird has
a calendar.  there's tribe, (ugh) myspace, and (double ugh)
facebook.  hell, even *i'm* playing techno at a gig in two
weeks (this would be chuck g's "all funkin' night" party).

speaking of good techno, alex windsor dropped a sweet set on
7/4 at amnesia.

I feel kinda obligated to mention the DEF techno list here - def-announce-
subscribe@defsf.com
It's been going strong for around 5 years or so, and is just for Bay Area
and West Coast techno events, news, etc etc.

But what I was thinking was... Do you really want to promote to *everyone*?
 Sometimes it's more about reaching the right people, not a larger quantity
of people. When I first started throwing parties, I naively assumed that
people would like techno if only they were exposed to it, so I was all about
reaching as large of an audience as possible.  I learned pretty quickly
that's not really how it works...!  At one party, I overheard one raver say
to another, in regards to the all-techno lineup, "What the fuck is this
shit? I want some fuckin' TRANCE!"   I still laugh about that one...

And furthermore, I don't think that having a few low-turnout parties is
necessarily evidence of not having enough channels to promote.  Parties just
tank sometimes (uhh... all the time!).  There are tons of factors that make
a successful or unsuccessful event, not just the amount of promotion. Also,
remember there are 1,034,783,402,349 techno parties in the Bay Area every
week, happening nearly every single night. I feel like the techno club
market is saturated. I'm not about to hit every single run-of-the-mill
techno club night every week, Tuesday through Sunday.

These promoter discussions are sort of funny.  We're this promoter scene
that promotes to promoters. Where have all the ravers gone?  (Gone to
promoters every one?)

places i know for promoting and/or hearing about techno in SF....

***email lists
sfraves list
defsf list

***online forums
blipswitch.net
groundscore.net (non dnb/dubstep forum)

***events websites
nitevibe
sfstation
flavorpill (if they select your event)
going.com
upcoming.org
nitewise
craigslist

***social networks
myspace
facebook
tribe

***and don't forget the good old fashioned staples....
postering @ parties
postering on telephone poles etc in the haight (i've got #s for the guys)
hand-to-hand flyering!


as michael mentioned, i also keep an informal calendar of events that i
think look cool/interesting and post it on the myspace bulletin board from
time to time. if you want access to it, send me a friend request and watch
the bulletin board.  i usually send the same updates from our kontrol
profile, so if i don't know you, i'd prefer you add that one.  i try to keep
my personal profile to mostly people i actually know.

profiles here:
http://www.myspace.com/bird415
http://www.myspace.com/kontrolsf

there are lots of other online sites that can be hit (resident advisor,
ibiza-voice, tranceaddict, yadda yadda) but if you're looking for frequently
updated listings of LOCAL techno, i'd prolly recommend blipswitch and/or the
myspace bulletin board (assuming your friends with some techno-minded
folks/parties).

ray, my feeling is that the girl you spoke with really hasn't been trying
too hard.  if she was she'd know she's not one of the "10 techno headz in
SF".

for all of you who are about to say "yeah but all that shit's too minimal
for me... where's the REAL techno in SF?" please know, we don't
discriminate!  we book stuff we like.  if its not your bag, round up some
friends, book djs you want to see, throw a party, promote the hell out of
it, and hope for the best.  it CAN be done, as the bassaholics anonymous,
defsf, and platform crews, amongst others, have shown.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] so how else can we promote?

Chel-C's comment on not needing to reach every soul on earth is straight up.
I think most rave promoters are still operating in the 90s (funny how
that works..) marketing headspace. that is: impressions. Reaching as
many people as possible. Most effective promotion is word of mouth
promotion; person to person. You guys just need to reach your
lighthouse customers, the ones who will talk to everyone else...

In fact, seeing flyers for a party everywhere I go kind of discourages
me from going..

Subject: Re: [sfraves] so how else can we promote?

u forgot bayraves.

(hah)

Good list btw, but I'm more interested in hearing of specific email 
lists that I am perhaps not on. I'm talking strategik, acid totem, 
partykidz, etc...

I get the kontrol announce from myspace as it's pretty fresh to get all 
of the upcoming flyers in one spot.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] FW: [SpAzLiSt] RIP DJ Tron

Thanks for sharing apollo.

I was recently wondering what happened to DjTron as I was a huge fan of 
his way back when. I wasn't certain even if he was still producing 
anymore so I spent some time trying to track him down on the internet 
for no reason other than to see what he was up to.

And then this news.

I've posted one of his albums that I just ripped if anyone feels like 
some terrorcore/gabber/hardcore:

Just make sure to bring along some good lubrication...

Just make sure to bring along some good lubrication...

Speaking of which, FWIW, I left a small stack of flyers in a smoke/sex shop up in Petaluma.  Will be interested to see if any properly lubed Petalumians show up.

Peace,

Yep, about the same list I use. :)  I gave up on tribe as it's just too
chaotic to choose by group instead of genre, and I don't like hitting everyone.

Yep.  I've gotten a lot of new folks this way.  Most especially the ones
who've recently moved to the area and don't have a starting context.

Bit of that, yes.  She's a musician who's mostly wired into glitchy industrial
and some ambient-like stuff, so she's actually buried in her own scene and
wondering why there's no techno there. :)


However, I've met a lot of folks over the last 6 months or so who, if they
moved to SF in the last year, simply don't know where to start.  I agree
that maximizing impressions misses the point, but given the dyamic nature
of SF's population, there are a lot of these folks.  Hell, some folks who
came to the first faktion party have already moved out of town again.

I'm also running into some folks who're even more trapped in the 90s than
most of us.  The continued blurring of the line between house and techno
turns a lot of them off.  Of course, my problem here is that I think the
first priority of a party is to have fun, not get stuck in some theoretical
issue of exactly which genre every track is.  I've got no problems booking
the housier and trancier sounding DJs if I like their shit, yet I also love
booking hard techno DJs, and yeah, I will probably return to minimal very
soon now. :)

SRSLY, I still think there's a problem of reach.  I'm NOT a great promoter,
(or at least there are plenty of you guys who're better at it than I am)
and yet I'm still finding a fair chunk of these folks.  Yeah, a lot of them
really just aren't trying, but a good number of them are and just don't
know where to start looking.  It's not a matter of hitting more eyeballs,
though I have hit the chron folks a few times and gotten a few responses
there too -- just a matter of being too expensive for the few people I
wanted to reach, there.  I suppose in some ways it's just the price of
living in a city as diverse in SF.  This girl isn't really one of 10 heads,
she's just one of the 10 heads in her microcosm.

I just still think there are ways to find and meet these people who really
do like techno, if we can figure out how to target those we've never met
before.  Call it the startup guy in me. :)

-R.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] so how else can we promote?

I don't promote anything, I help organize events ;)

All the event organizers I know started out as ravers, and all the 
"promoters" I met when I was a raver were previously ravers.  It's a 
cycle.  The people I learned from aren't doing much these days.  New 
people step up to fill in, and a new generation of ravers commences.

when i first started going to parties, i had to do my own work.
 you know, go to clothing stores (ameba), record stores, shit
like that.

i'd find a party and talk with people there.  i would ask about
what was happening next week.  i'd go out to my car and have
like ten flyers on it.  soon, i'd identified the shady
promoters, the greedy promoters, the book-local-talent-only
promoters, etc.  i would start noting DJs i liked and going out
specifically to hear them, and would start going to certain
promoter's parties because of the high production value.  and i
did this with minimal internets.

i mean come on - today you can google most of this stuff and
come up with dirt on almost every popular DJ and a bunch of
their free mp3 sets.

i think these people we've never met before are lazy.

Which sounds to me like an argument for the superiority of a specific technique or set of techniques.  "Testing it" over "sitting around meditating".

I don't accept that one technique is superior to all others, IMO it all depends on the person, their circumstances, and the specific situation.

"The goal of training in the martial arts is to overcome six kinds of
disease, 
	* the desire for victory, 
	* the desire to rely on technical cunning, 
	* the desire to show off, 
	* the desire to psychologically overwhelm the opponent, 
	* the desire to remain passive in order to wait for an opening, and 
	* the desire to become free of these diseases." 
--Yagyu Munenori 

Best,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR:  THOUGHT

you said that buddhism is science of the mind.

martial arts have distilled buddhism, and teach the science of the 
mind, as well as the science of the body.  buddhism is a great deal 
more than that.  therefore, I feel that if you're strictly going for 
"science of the mind," you're better served learning a martial art.

I don't accept enlightenment, so technique to reach it is 
irrelevant.  technique to achieve the best results from the science 
of mind and body is debatable.

I might trainwreck all night, but at least I get to play.

Fuck.

I'm at a point where if someone is playing interesting music, I could give 
a fuck about a couple shibby mixes here and there.

Beatmatching is ultimately a fairly simple parlor trick (assuming your 
records are 4/4 enough, this can already be done fairly well by currently 
available software for you, yay~!).

DJing is the ability to select tunes (this should fall within the 
capabilities of anybody who has ever put an iTunes playlist together, and 
most modern cd players will play CDs with folders on them, whee... and 
most mp3/digital playback systems have that plus additional grouping 
heirarchies).

The ability to purchase easily, mix easily, organize tracks and seamlessly 
flow have all been made significantly easier by modern technologies like 
per channel EQ with deep cuts, cd/mp3 djing systems with pitch correction 
allowing greater than +/-8%, contemporary dance mixes which have easier 
mix cueing than ever, digital playlists and massive filesystems with 
integrated cuepoints, etc...

10 years ago, if a DJ trainwrecked, me and most people I know would wince, 
we'd talk shit, etc.  Now, I'm really really stoked with a DJ if they 
don't bore the living shit out of me, trainwrecks be damned.

Good luck Pinkko, find your own sound, do your own thing, and the 
dancefloor from a legion of eye-socket-buggeringly-boring DJs.  Worry more 
about finding your own voice and taking people somewhere that doesn't 
sound like everybody else, the technique comes in time, but good taste and 
a unique sound is something you should work on from day one.

andyw

p.s. Yes, I know good taste is relative, but every time I go out lately I 
hear the same shit.  and it sucks.  The world does not need more stuff 
that sounds like Justice.  If you have ADD, go get treatment and/or suck 
it up, flush your Ritalin down the shitter and get over the fact that it's 
just another word for being easily bored and let us have hyponotic dance 
music back on the dancefloor where it fucking belongs.  That shit is as 
bad as old handbag house for all the same reasons and nobody's had the 
balls to say so.  Something tells me I am ranting again, I'll go now.

Ooops, one of those last paragraphs should start:
"Good luck Pinkko, find your own sound, do your own thing, and SAVE the 
dancefloor from a legion of eye-socket-buggeringly-boring DJs."

not:
"Good luck Pinkko, find your own sound, do your own thing, and the 
dancefloor from a legion of eye-socket-buggeringly-boring DJs."

Stupid pop-up window + vi = ate a word.

My bad.

Thanks! I've gotten significantly better since I quit doing drugs. :-D

I'm thinking an old school jungle / liquid funk type set will be good to
open the night with. Good thing I got plenty of both to drop.

p.s. Yes, I know good taste is relative, but every time I go out lately I 
hear the same shit.  and it sucks.  The world does not need more stuff 
that sounds like Justice.  If you have ADD, go get treatment and/or suck

Amen, that sound got boring pretty quickly, it just doesn't have any dynamics, grates on the ear.  I always feel like I need to driving a camaro on poppers when I hear that stuff.  Also, I've heard you rail on "electro house" here and there, so you'll probably be happy to note that the genre has gone from something I found cool and dynamic to stinking on ice in the span of 6 months, and almost every track I buy now is classified as techno, or maybe tech house.

Electro House = Today's Big Beat, minus the star power.

The cycle begins again, lol,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] so how else can we promote? ok.. more techno

I've had the links for the DEF-announce list in my signature for years. 
Shrug.

  I agree with stickman, you have to be out there actively seeking it 
out and KNOW YOUR SCENE before you come and say they ain't no scene.

  I also think there has been an underground techno scene for a reason, 
and that was to keep the snooty club attitudes out of the rave scene. 
But since techno has adapted itself to be more flexible outside a dark, 
one red light bulb lit warehouse, its been taking on aspects of other 
genres and challenging itself on what it could become, rather than what 
techno is not. i think techno used to be about, -not being trance, -not 
being house, -not being this and that, as a struggle for an identity in 
an exploding EDM scene in the 90s.. when its apparent that trance is 
DEAD (dead-dida-dead dead) and house sounds just like techno (or is it 
vice verse?), and techno seems to be evolving monthly again, the techno 
scene is just exploding with possibilities... its with these 
possibilities techno is becoming more fresh and it is  moving into 
unexpected places, like the club circuit. i.e. places where people will 
not expect techno and as a result, all sorts of people will come to be 
curious about it. Maybe this girl is just a newbe and has just been 
turned on? I feel with the influx of people from all over the world to 
SF on an annual basis, I as a born and raised norcal kid am feeling like 
its hard to keep up with all the new people wanting to join the techno 
scene and help it evolve. -but I also feel that's what makes it all so 
exciting! I love that there's so much fresh blood in the scene now.

Old people are coming back into the techno scene all over. Cool people 
from the midwest are heading out here to SF. The northwest techno scene 
is taking off and the droid list is pushing numbers past the thousands 
in LA. There are way more producers than DJs now and that's f'n cool 
which means that there will be a new techno sound evolving out here on 
the west coast. Eventually we will live in some exciting times in a 
musical sense, I predict... possibly rivaling Detroit's legacy and 
matching Berlin's influence.. maybe even starting something better and 
evolving into unimagined genres besides techno. Who knows?

peace love techno!!

Sean f*ckin Ocean

btw

http://www.defsf.com = techno `;P lol.

And when doesn't Alex Windsor kill it? I'd be very surprised if I 
*wasn't* sweaty and punch drunk at the end of one of his sets. Saying 
Alex sucks at DJing is like saying sex feels bad. lol `;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Your chance to hear Pinkko trainwreck!

yeah i want to hear some style out there. good point andy. when i was 
first going to raves i would just  totally be in tune with what a dj was 
playing if they tried hard and represented their own type of style. 
where you could hear and feel the difference between DJs as they stepped 
up to the decks and delivered. i'm not saying that you shouldn't try 
hard to mix as flawlessly as you can because that too is a sense of 
style and class but if i heard records that went somewhere and had a 
certain quality that another DJ lacked i'd be goin, 'damn that dj made 
my day.'

i think alot of Djs these days feel obligated to play out of a social 
obligation to promote the scene they are in. Rather than the promoter 
searching high and low to find this dj to rock the party cause this dj 
had a disco tan and wasn't getting heard. now its just djs throwing dj 
parties.  that's why i try to book myself for my own parties anymore 
unless its to save some guy from djing last.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The Gathering, Freedom, and Basics sets for download

Yes.....:)   I had just downloaded the 1992 Josh set and was listening  
to it.  Brought back those candy-flipping days when we would begin  
dancing Friday night, go to the "Church," continue on Saturday night  
through Sunday night and go to work on Monday.  Every weekend and some  
weeknites. Wonderful!!!  Catches one on the back-end of life, tho, but  
if I had to do it all over again I'd do more of it.

So I'm back in the early nineties listening to Josh when I hear a  
siren outside.  Look out the window and the PG&E crew have  broken  
into a gas main right in front of my house.  Gas spewing into the  
air.  Fire trucks.  Police.  Rush to get my birds and discover the  
downstairs bedroom stinks of gas.  Bring them upstairs and seal  
windows.  Now it looks like the finally shut off the leak.  Everyone  
OK so far.

So back to the 20th century.  I have some tapes of sets I did at the  
Endup in those days.  Dekadence.  Uranus.  Legendary queer parties.  I  
keep meaning to put it all on CDs.  Better do it before I go up in  
smoke on of these days:)

Love,

Apollo

"We're all afloat in a boundless sea,
and the way we cope is by massing together in groups and pretending in  
unison that the situation is other than it is. We reinforce the  
illusion for each other. That's what a society really is, a little  
band of humanity huddled together against the specter of a pitch black  
sea. Everyone is treading water to keep their heads above the surface  
even though they have no reason to believe that the life they're  
preserving is better than the alternative they're avoiding. It's just  
that one is known and one is not. Fear of the unknown is what keeps  
everyone busily treading water. All fear is fear of the unknown. If  
someone in such a group of water-treaders betrays the group lie by  
speaking the truth of their situation, that person is called a  
heretic, and society reserves its most awful punishments for heretics.  
If someone decides to stop struggling and just sink or float away,  
every possible effort is made to stop him, not for the benefit of the  
individual, but for the benefit of the group. To deny at all costs the  
truth of the situation."

Folks, try this.  Go to the supermarket and look at the label.  If it  
says "natural flavoring", put it back.  Or, if you don't believe me,  
take it home, and call the company, and ask them what is in their  
"natural flavoring".  They will not tell you.

Although I somewhat doubt the majority of people who go out really care or pay attention to what is being played sometimes. They may be at the club because they like the music but not everyone is down for techno like people on this list. 
 
For the most part when I think of going to some of the techno parties in SF I picture a couple oriented scene and lots of dude on dude activity (no pun intended for you gay dudes because you probably feel the same at an all straight club). For a straight dude in SF going to techno parties well you get the rest if you know what I mean it is hard to find a good party with hot chicks and when you do the party gets labeled as some trendy party because lots of hot chicks will not kick it in a warehouse. I will be making my second trip to Amsterdam next week for two weeks so fun times are ahead. 
 
Maybe I go to the wrong parties sometimes but undergrounds in sketchy hoods are just liabilities for temporary fun. Not to mention I am old enough to get into a club so a party that I would have went to as a teen is not that appealing. In this day and age not knowing where the party is going to be until you get a map or wait until a few hours before the info is released is not that big of a deal and hardly surprising.

p.s. Yes, I know good taste is relative, but every time I go out lately I
hear the same shit.  and it sucks.  The world does not need more stuff
that sounds like Justice.  If you have ADD, go get treatment and/or suck
it up, flush your Ritalin down the shitter and get over the fact that it's
just another word for being easily bored and let us have hyponotic dance
music back on the dancefloor where it fucking belongs.

Amen, that sound got boring pretty quickly, it just doesn't have any dynamics, grates on the ear.  I always feel like I need to driving a camaro on poppers when I hear that stuff.  Also, I've heard you rail on "electro house" here and there, so you'll probably be happy to note that the genre has gone from something I found cool and dynamic to stinking on ice in the span of 6 months, and almost every track I buy now is classified as techno, or maybe tech house.

Electro House = Today's Big Beat, minus the star power.

I just wanted to let you know that I have recently been in touch with =20
someone who used to be on the list nstuff, but moved on like I =20
probably should have years ago.  So I won't say who it is nstuff, but =20
I'll let you guess.  I did encourage him to drop by and say hi.  Now =20
all we have to do is find what's her name, oh, snap, what's her name?  =20

Oh, and, as always, we need to bring back the Coke vs. Pepsi thread.

In the beginning, there's always some type of high ideal that drives
these men and these women.  They're always going to do something for,
and here's the key phrase, for the greater good and the greater
number.  And you're going to find that element behind all the
different variants of collectivism.

The common denominator behind all these ideologies of Communism,
Socialsim, Facism, all of these systems under which we have found are
horrible conditions under which to live, the common ideology behind
them all is called collectivism.  The individual must be sacrificed
for the greater good of the greater number.

Amen, that sound got boring pretty quickly, it just doesn't have any dynamics, grates on the ear.  I always feel like I need to driving a camaro on poppers when I hear that stuff.  Also, I've heard you rail on "electro house" here and there, so you'll probably be happy to note that the genre has gone from something I found cool and dynamic to stinking on ice in the span of 6 months, and almost every track I buy now is classified as techno, or maybe tech house.

Electro House = Today's Big Beat, minus the star power.

The cycle begins again, lol,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Your chance to hear Pinkko trainwreck!

Naw, I loved big beat- but I think it worked to a large degree because of the character and the larger-than-life-ness of its makers.  The sheer dollars spent making its producers into rockstars, putting on those huge tours, etc.

It was trashy, and there was a 10:1 ratio of shit to real gold in it, but the gold was great, and the cult of personality only made it more alluring.

Electro house is like that, to me, only the S:G ratio is FAR higher, and the producers are largely faceless (like most UG music), so there's no "Aww, this new Fatboy Slim track kind of sucks, but he's so great I guess I'll give it another listen".  It's just "OOGH, this sounds like a giant duck farting.  NEXT!".

The gold in electro house up til a few months ago was something I really dug.  I just feel like the "top tracxxxs" and djs in the genre at the moment are getting too arena-y for their britches, and consequently, if I were to drop one of their tracks at a club with less than a couple thousand people in it, I'd feel like a ripe d-bag.  Still love Dirtybird, still love lots of stuff.

It's not the music, it's the shifted boundaries.

p.s. Yes, I know good taste is relative, but every time I go out lately I
hear the same shit.  and it sucks.  The world does not need more stuff
that sounds like Justice.  If you have ADD, go get treatment and/or suck
it up, flush your Ritalin down the shitter and get over the fact that it's
just another word for being easily bored and let us have hyponotic dance
music back on the dancefloor where it fucking belongs.

Amen, that sound got boring pretty quickly, it just doesn't have any dynamics, grates on the ear.  I always feel like I need to driving a camaro on poppers when I hear that stuff.  Also, I've heard you rail on "electro house" here and there, so you'll probably be happy to note that the genre has gone from something I found cool and dynamic to stinking on ice in the span of 6 months, and almost every track I buy now is classified as techno, or maybe tech house.

Electro House = Today's Big Beat, minus the star power.

The cycle begins again, lol,

I used to love big beat, except no one plays on it big sound systems 
anymore.   So it sounds like ... sucky beat.

I disagree that 'Electro House is crap.'  I believe the continued growing popularity of digital music, coupled with the popularity of the genre, has made it increasingly harder to find good Electro House.

A couple years ago you could dig through and find lots of great Electro House, now you have to dig through tons and tons of crap to find something decent.

maybe i should rephrase.

90% or more of the more recent electro house i've heard is
crap.

and the 10% i do hear that is not crap turns out to be older
stuff.

I could not agree more.  You had to have your shit together and know what 
you're doing in order to cut a track in the vinyl days.  While I'm not a 
vinyl-purist, I saw the value of that very early.

Because the tracks are so easily and accessible now during the digital era, 
it dillutes the quality of what's being played.  Rather than investing in 
your music, some DJs can just get by with a few pieces of nickel.

I think this has both helped and hurt EDM.  Some deserving people who 
wouldn't get exposure otherwise are getting attention, whereas some ... 
yeah.

love always

Yeah, let it be known, I really do love lots of electro house.  I just feel the traditional guidelines of the genre have shifted significantly, and that one-note joke of "big sawtoothy bassline, pitched up and down, dirty mix, oooh big spooky breakdown" is TOO locked in to allow for much innovation.

It's like democrat and republican.  The mission and meaning behind them switch places every so often.  

I will happily buy any electro house that is awesome.  I'm just finding it hard to keep getting stoked on new stuff.  Hence, techno/tech house, which is where my attention lies now.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Your chance to hear Pinkko trainwreck!

sorry, i just haven't heard anything new in the electro-house
genre that doesn't sound cookie-cutter.

when i'm on beatport, i'll search thru maybe 200 electro-house
tracks and find maybe 1-2 that i like.  pretty slim pickings
(for me, anyway).

it's almost as bad as downtempo.  i'll go so far as to say i
hate 95% of the new downtempo that's out.  so much crap out
there.  or maybe i'm just picky and jaded.

Well said, Mr. Tummyluv.

I go out to hear good music and be around people I like and generally care
about, not to get laid. Though I'm not opposed to getting laid if the
opportunity presents itself. Really, I think most people that are really
into the 'scene' and have been for some time are more about the music than
anything else. Especially when they continue to go out even if they're not
wasted. Also, not every DJ is into the whole trying to be a superstar thing=
.
Some of us just like to play music.

:-)

I'm finding the same to be true of drum and bass. Especially the harder
stuff. Seems like everyone's putting out this awful, ringtone-step, jump
uppy bullshit with obnoxious basslines and uncreative drum loops. Good thing
I don't mind playing older shit, eh?

There's some pretty cool shit happening in dubstep, though it's not like any
of you fuckers would deign to listen to such an awful genre.

Also, gabber + hhc = sexytime romantic candy EXPLOSION!

IMO, one of the benefits of the explosion of digital EDM in the past several
years is older stuff can still wind up sounding fresh.

There's so much out there that no one could possibly know it all; and a
track released two years ago that was ahead of its time--and under the
radar--can fit in neatly with more current material, and even the devoted
may not have heard it before. Every once in a while I come across a track
released as far back as 2001 that still sounds playable with stuff released
last week.

I agree about the epic-y sounding shit in the genre though. Not that I don'=
t play any of it=2C but I try to pick and choose when I do more because of =
that feel of "too much" happening...especially if it's not at some massive =
event with a boomin' system. Super epic on a tiny system sounds...forced an=

Well=2C my last Beatport outing I loaded up on "minimal" (most of which was=
 not all that minimal)=2C techno=2C and tech-house. Bear in mind almost eve=
rything I got out of 3 genres is by and large interchangeable. I did not fi=
nd any electro-house tracks that struck me this time around. That being sai=
d...the LAST Beatport purchase I made=2C 3/4's of what I got was "electro-h=
ouse"=2C so maybe I just got all the good shit there was for the last few m=
onths? No clue.=20

But that's what I love about digital digging. Finding that one track out of=
 100 that totally rips it. I am glad to not find hit after hit after hit=2C=
 because if I did=2C then I'd wind up hearing every other DJ that I like to=
 go watch play all the same shit I do.

The one thing I loved about Record Shops is that you had a good idea of wha=
t
types of records they were buying, and the guy behind the counter could
usually guide you to lesser known stuff that you likely dug.

What rocks about beatport most, is also what makes them suck.  Their huge
selection.  I have the same problems as most of you have, going through
hundreds of songs, and maybe only picking up 5 of them.  I find myself
searching artists and labels much more often, and buying tracks that aren't
new releases because of the onslaught of crap that's on there.   Finding
lesser known gems has become more difficult, as I don't have the time to
listen to the 490 crappy new releases in a single subgenre on a daily basis
to find 10 decent ones.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Customer opinion about SF techno parties

ok... I respect your opinion about the underground & this is my opinion of
your opinion... you're a fucki'n idiot man... serioulsy... it sounds like
you just all up in the scene period to go make your female prey swoop or
some shit.... whatever man... seriously... your "graduations" from one
scene to another don't really shit 'cause I mean... you just become one of
them... I'm gonna be very biased here & judemental... but it sounds like
you just went to those undergrounds just to go.. you never had fun... you
just went to go 'til somethim better came along & well.. I mean.. good for
you... you can proudly show your Driver Liscense to a bouncer 'cause
you're of age...

But I mean.. i dunno when you got on this list or what, but Techno is a
big thing on here man... with alota the Family lists (fnf, cloudfactory,
etc.), we Love Techno... as Chel-C pointed out last year... that we do
have a small Techno scene here compared to Germany where there is a
Huuuuge scene out there... & yeah... more of the Techno gatherings here
now a days are like hardcore sausage fests like 14 males to 1 female..
true... but there I know for a fact that the population of Female Techno
Lovers in the bay area is sooo damn high.. they just don't come out as
much...

But seriously... you sound like a joke... this post is sad.. really sad
man... seriously dude...  you want your fuckin' chicks, so jock on them
hookerz on Braodway man... it sounds like that all you want from what i
gather in your post...

See.. & that's another thing... in the Underground Techno Scene here in
the Bay Area... people actually do care about the music... that's why we
have our gatherings man... that's why we like being where we are 'caus
unlike them plastic club you be gon' to to get your Chicas... we go to to
worship the beats the DJ puts out... we do out thing on the dancefloor to
show our appreciation for the DJ & dance in community... apparently that's
not good enough for you & you need to go to them hoochie stands in them
glossy lit shiney clubs...

but again... this is all my opinion! :)  have a good day!!

Amen to that Ben.

I had two guys at Solid Grooves, one at Tweakin, one at Harmonics, one at 
Open Mind, even got a call every so often from Capricorn in SC... all 
looking out for shit they'd thought I'd like.  Plus weird hookups like 
Angel Alanis sending me whatever promos he got sent that he didn't like 
and whatever he was putting out cause I got him his first booking in SF.  
That whole chain hardly exists anymore (well, at least for me).

The value of the expensive to make "thing" has gone, and it's been good 
and bad in a lot of ways I don't think anybody anticipated.

A producer had less chance to put stuff out, and it was harder to make a 
track back then (producers had studios with mixers and samplers and 
effects racks, not just a computer, some monitors and a bunch of plugins).  
Then they had to get a label to press it.  Then a buyer/distributor to 
pick it up.  And a store to buy it.  Lots of quality control.  Yeah, it 
was somewhat corrupt and prone to edging out weird shit, but there were a 
lot more places for total garbage to get stuck in the channel before it 
got to the bins too.

Some techno is the fucking bomb.  What other people think, doesn't matter 
all that much to me.  Never did.  I got into it when my friends weren't 
into it, and I've had my just desserts time and time again when I took a 
party somewhere that no other genre could (I've also cleared some floors, 
but hey, if I love it and you don't sorry... it's what I do, shame on the 
promoter I guess).  I learned how to mix at house (not the genre but as in 
domocile) parties.  I came up not by scheming and plotting and promoting, 
but by making mixes a couple times a year and playing bigger and bigger 
parties.  I kept getting invited back.  I've played for the 5 people who 
are too ef'd up to sleep at 7 am at a cabin party, and I've played peak 
hour after John Selway for 5000 heads and just *aced* it.  Got involved 
with a couple crews.  Some of those crews are still going, pure as ever.  
And most every time, I played techno.  Not techno like the other word for 
"electronica", but the deep shit, drum machines and samplers with a groove 
in the 128-142 zone sounding nice and minimal and very synthetic with a 
bassline that bypasses your brain and direct hits yer arse... the sound of 
Berlin and Detroit and Stockholm and Lost and the tradition of No UFOs and 
Basic Channel and DJ Rush and Losing Control and Advent and No Way Back.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMshcL5P7vI
(god I love this record, wish more stuff on the techno/house edge grooved 
like this)

The money, well, it's nice and I guess I care sure... but not all that 
much.  I was never a big fan of the "professional musician".  I like music 
the same way I like sex, I love it enough that I'd rather have a day job 
and not make money off it.  Cause when you make money off it, you gotta do 
what mommy/daddy wants you to do rather than what gets you off, and I'd 
rather lose some money for the opportunity to keep it my way.  There was a 
time when I made some serious scrilla off DJing/doing sound in this town, 
those days are gone, I'm not crying.  It comes and it goes when you do 
what you want to rather than try to adjust to trends.  You say fuck the 
trends, and you end up having a record collection you love, even when 
you're not booked to play shit.  I've honestly reached a point where I'm 
just not that interested in DJing anymore... vinyl is dying, I can't be 
bothered with picking through thousands of pieces of crap on Beatport to 
get the good stuff, and if someone wants to hear what I sound like I'll 
just bomb my own shit off the laptop or outboard gear I wrote it on (I 
still write all the time).

-&e-> Although I somewhat doubt the majority of people who go out really 
-&e->care or pay attention to what is being played sometimes. They may be 
-&e->at the club because they like the music but not everyone is down for 
-&e->techno like people on this list.

I want the music to be important.  There are times when it isn't.  No 
biggy, if it's still a good time.  But when a promoter doesn't care about 
the music, they should stop promoting through the music scene and go the 
way of the dead city ULTRACLUBZ and just enjoy their lame ass $70 bottle 
service, butterface collagen hoes and some 15 year old Global Underground 
CD playing quietly in the background.  Get off SFR and promote at the Gold 
Club, at 1015, on the roofs of cabs picking up lonely businessmen from 
their "massages" and Nightvibe.com.  This started out not only as a "not a 
club" list, but as the antithesis of that entire vibe.  We were down with 
Full Moons, the Gathering, and Stompy, and Come-Unity and Sunset... but 
not that total clubber hookup shit (even though there were a strong 
contingent of peeps who LOVED going to house weeklies, we always drew a 
fine line between the pickup joint scene and the head down I LOVE HOUSE 
groovers).

Ugh, this stuff is just slaying me on a sunny day in SF in my backyard 
responding to SFR heheheh...

-&e->For the most part when I think of going to some of the techno parties 
-&e->in SF I picture a couple oriented scene and lots of dude on dude 
-&e->activity (no pun intended for you gay dudes because you probably feel 
-&e->the same at an all straight club). For a straight dude in SF going to 
-&e->techno parties well you get the rest if you know what I mean it is 
-&e->hard to find a good party with hot chicks and when you do the party 
-&e->gets labeled as some trendy party because lots of hot chicks will not 
-&e->kick it in a warehouse. I will be making my second trip to Amsterdam 
-&e->next week for two weeks so fun times are ahead?.

Congratulations on the paragraph most likely to troll me this year.  Say 
something homophobic and totally pointless, then appeal to your gay bros 
for clemency assuming they couldn't possibly have fun at a straight club.  
Congratulations on labeling anybody who might actually look at the DJ 
lineup or music as a reason for going out... guess it's all about TEH 
ARSE.

And on the "dude on dude" comments, do you have any idea where house music 
came from?  Know your history, seriously man.  While "real men" were 
burning disco records in baseball stadium riots, gay disco kept the groove 
by going underground and cheap... and the first step was losing the 
backing bands and making it with electronics.  Welcome to house music in 
the 80s, where all this came from pretty much.

Maybe, just maybe, when I'm on the dance floor it's me + music and whoever 
I see smiling and grooving and it's not sexual.  It's different, and the 
sexual/attraction bit has NEVER been why I was there.  Why do you think 
this underground happened in SF the way it did *right* as we had a 
thriving dance club scene?  Cause we got sick of oogling cokehead boring 
ass fuckface scenesters trying to find a place to park their dicks and 
hoochies hoping to hook some fucknut blowing through cash like it's 5 
minutes till the rapture to whom music was a secondary concern.  We loved 
our drugs, our freaky selves, and the music, PERIOD.  It's not that we 
couldn't succeed in that scene, it's that it's a sad display built around 
money, pussy, fashion and trends.  The clubs embodied that.  So we went 
underground and ducked the whole thing.  Fuck the law, fuck the club 
scene, fuck it all, we were plugged in and we weren't begging for people 
to show up.  Somehow that took care of itself.  We did so well, that 
places like Sound Factory and 1015 started looking to US for what to do 
next... and they couldn't, because those places couldn't compete with the 
freedom, the autonomy, the underground economy and ultimately dealing with 
a crowd that didn't seem too intersted in overpriced drinks... as if we'd 
figured out another way to have a good time.  Well actually, they delved 
into that and got busted 7 ways from sunday.  And they actually got to a 
point where they started calling the cops on UGs.  Oooops.  And then they 
tried to work with us.  Gosh, seems it's easy to forgive anything when 
there's a dollar to be made.

-&e->Maybe I go to the wrong parties sometimes but undergrounds in sketchy 
-&e->hoods are just liabilities for temporary fun. Not to mention I am old 
-&e->enough to get into a club so a party that I would have went to as a 
-&e->teen is not that appealing. In this day and age not knowing where the 
-&e->party is going to be until you get a map or wait until a few hours 
-&e->before the info is released is not that big of a deal and hardly 
-&e->surprising. I spend lots of money when I go out so I try and choose 
-&e->where I go wisely and getting laid after working my balls off all 
-&e->week matters to me?

Sometimes I've got money, and sometimes I don't, but I never like feeling 
like I'm in a place where that's all that matters.

Isaac, are you sure you're not the guy who used to throw parties at a 
space called the crackhouse, more than once even?  I'll spare the list the 
details, but I remember those days well.  In any case, shaky ground to 
stand on when talking about UGs in sketchy hoods.

I felt this really hit home with the Gavin Newsom/Matt Gonzales 
contest.  I saw SO MANY well intentioned posters (and similar) that were 
jabs at Newsom, but which STILL INCLUDED HIS NAME.  Thus, name 
recognition came about.  Ugh.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Public Service Annoucement

have you listened to fabric 22 by adam beyer? techno's changed. there's 
so many house references and micro house changes in there and alot of 
progressive elements..  in my mind that mix is more techno than it was 
ever, because i think it has tracks that are number one, by all techno 
artists and number, two could quite possibly be an evolution of techno 
rather than a regression. that shit is fresh. and that's what techno is 
all about, being fresh.

as much as i love being beaten up by the speakers when a tough and dirty 
techno track is being played by a seminal midwest hero like say, jeff 
mills, i also enjoy the new shit just as much. i love where techno is 
going and love that it has changed so much in the last 5 years. even 
jeff mills'  stuff with the all the soundtrack work he has done for 
silent films is incredible and different.

no beef. i used to only like the hard stuff and thought all the new 
stuff was shite.. but people are really stirring up the pot these days 
-it's not the same old stuff, and that's exciting. . i don't know what 
sort of new techno track will be coming along next.

you should be happy.. techno still rules and it is the one of the most 
advanced genres today along side skwee, dubstep, experimental, and 
whatever you want to call idm.

peace love techno. `;)

in alot of the smaller venues like whre the Bleeding Heart Techno Party
was, Josh's garage venue, the flowershop hq in the City, even bliss...
like i mean... I ain't seen alot females down to party... I mean...
there's alota chicas from family crews & stuff that come out & party down
yeah, but I mean... even the promoters called their own shindigs
sausagefests....

Like seriously man, I ain't tryin' to knock ya Marco, but I ain't seen ya
at these gatherings dudes, so you're probs talkin' about some other ones
like greg's or ray's parties...  & that's good, really good  to get that
support, no doubt, but I mean... it's not like back in the day here when
it was hella just gender equal esp when (for example) ASR was doing their
thang & all them Overflow parties & stuff is what i'm sayin' like compared
to now or like Tuesday nights @ An Sabin or even that monthly @ that
Castle Bar place @ the TL that Miranda & Claire put on...

Yeah.. i know Issac's talkin' about like them other Shiney clubs like Ruby
Skies, etc.... but I don't think he even knows that he's talkin' real
Techno... he might be talkin' about like fuckin' Electro House, Proggy
House, & Trance...

> Electro-house like any other genre has crap in it. I have to chuckle at folks who always single out some particular genre to say how awful it is when it becomes super popular, considering every genre has had it's moment in the sun, and every genre has had it's share of crap tunes being churned out. 

I think there's this tendency to notice the increase in crap over the increase
in great tracks, simply because the great tracks are always in the minority.

Arguably, there are only going to be about the same number of great tracks
that really break new ground.  This means that as any genre gets even a bit
more popular, the % of tracks worth listening to goes down.  It's always
easier to suck than excel.

Something I consider an ironic validation that techno is blowing up this
year, is that I've actually been starting to hear some of the most mind
numbing, boring ass commercial sounding techno ever this year.  I just
don't want to hear it at a party. :)

But none of that really matters.  It isn't just that beatport makes it easy,
it's the flip side of what was brought up earlier this year.  Now that big
labels no longer have a stranglehold, ANYONE can churn out crap to try and
make money(or even make art that just doesn't work for anyone else), while
the artists who really work their craft still do what they have to do to get
their work out there.  As so many have said, you end up relying on references
from other people to help narrow the field, and other means.  Some labels
are consistently better, some artists continue to break new ground, etc.

And it doesn't matter how many crap tracks there are if the worthwhile ones
still come out at the same rate.  No matter how much crap is there, parties
still run the same length of time, and sets are still the same length. You
get just as much time for a gig today as you did last year or 5 years ago.
The hard part is, and always has been, in figuring out better ways to skip
the crap without missing the jewels.  But even in the height of vinyl, there
were tons of releases a week once you got on the lists of enough labels.
Most of them just sucked.  Kind of like now. :)

> As with any genre, it's which tracks you pick and choose to spin...and seeing as how so many of the local breaks kids are now firmly wedged up the arse of electro-house, it's no big shock to me you hear the same shit out every single fucking time you go out. Those kids tend to cane to death the "top 10" tracks of the month or week or whatever. Now rather than doing it with breaks, they are just doing it with electro-house. Sad really seeing as how there's actually a ton of stuff in that genre that rocks pretty hard and it seems like me and fLOORCRAFT and some of the Bassyx kids are the only people really tapping into the better sounding shit right now....

Also, I've heard you rail on "electro house" here and there, so you'll probably be happy to note that the genre has gone from something I found cool and dynamic to stinking on ice in the span of 6 months, and almost every track I buy now is classified as techno, or maybe tech house.

Before 1971, the introduction of $1 new debt used to increase the GDP
by as much as $3 or more. Since 1971, this ratio started its
precipitous decline that has continued to this day without
interruption. It went negative in 2006, forecasting the financial
crisis that broke a year later. The reason for the decline is that
irredeemable debt causes capital destruction. It adds nothing to the
per capita quota of capital invested in aid of production. Indeed, it
may take away from it. As it displaces real capital, which represents
the deployment of more and better tools, productivity declines. The
laws of physics, unlike human beings, cannot be conned. Irredeemable
debt may only create make-belief capital.

- Professor Antal E. Fekete

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Your chance to hear Pinkko trainwreck!

You think? I'd be more inclined to say that the number of crappy tracks have increased exponentially, while the number of good tracks have stayed the same.

It's possible I was more dialed in to the good techno back when I was buying only vinyl. I did have help from folks in the record stores...

Electro-house like any other genre has crap in it. I have to chuckle at folks who always single out some particular genre to say how awful it is when it becomes super popular, considering every genre has had it's moment in the sun, and every genre has had it's share of crap tunes being churned out. 

I think there's this tendency to notice the increase in crap over the increase
in great tracks, simply because the great tracks are always in the minority.

Arguably, there are only going to be about the same number of great tracks
that really break new ground.  This means that as any genre gets even a bit
more popular, the % of tracks worth listening to goes down.  It's always
easier to suck than excel.

Something I consider an ironic validation that techno is blowing up this
year, is that I've actually been starting to hear some of the most mind
numbing, boring ass commercial sounding techno ever this year.  I just
don't want to hear it at a party. :)

But none of that really matters.  It isn't just that beatport makes it easy,
it's the flip side of what was brought up earlier this year.  Now that big
labels no longer have a stranglehold, ANYONE can churn out crap to try and
make money(or even make art that just doesn't work for anyone else), while
the artists who really work their craft still do what they have to do to get
their work out there.  As so many have said, you end up relying on references
from other people to help narrow the field, and other means.  Some labels
are consistently better, some artists continue to break new ground, etc.

And it doesn't matter how many crap tracks there are if the worthwhile ones
still come out at the same rate.  No matter how much crap is there, parties
still run the same length of time, and sets are still the same length. You
get just as much time for a gig today as you did last year or 5 years ago.
The hard part is, and always has been, in figuring out better ways to skip
the crap without missing the jewels.  But even in the height of vinyl, there
were tons of releases a week once you got on the lists of enough labels.
Most of them just sucked.  Kind of like now. :)


-R.




As with any genre, it's which tracks you pick and choose to spin...and seeing as how so many of the local breaks kids are now firmly wedged up the arse of electro-house, it's no big shock to me you hear the same shit out every single fucking time you go out. Those kids tend to cane to death the "top 10" tracks of the month or week or whatever. Now rather than doing it with breaks, they are just doing it with electro-house. Sad really seeing as how there's actually a ton of stuff in that genre that rocks pretty hard and it seems like me and fLOORCRAFT and some of the Bassyx kids are the only people really tapping into the better sounding shit right now....

No, I think he was saying that electro house is crap.  He's right.

p.s. Yes, I know good taste is relative, but every time I go out lately I
hear the same shit.  and it sucks.  The world does not need more stuff

it up, flush your Ritalin down the shitter and get over the fact that it's
just another word for being easily bored and let us have hyponotic dance
music back on the dancefloor where it fucking belongs.

Amen, that sound got boring pretty quickly, it just doesn't have any dynamics, grates on the ear.  I always feel like I need to driving a camaro on poppers when I hear that stuff.  Also, I've heard you rail on "electro house" here and there, so you'll probably be happy to note that the genre has gone from something I found cool and dynamic to stinking on ice in the span of 6 months, and almost every track I buy now is classified as techno, or maybe tech house.

Electro House = Today's Big Beat, minus the star power.

The cycle begins again, lol,

Sean,

A) I love you, I love your enthusiasm, and I love that you've ran with the 
torch while I stayed home and wrote grumpy emails.  The thing gets heavy 
after a while and while I still go out I'm not the OUT EVERY NIGHT SOLID 
MOFO I used to be.  As much shit as I give everybody, I'm thankful for 
people like you and GregB... but as long as I have an email account and an 
audience and you all don't do my bidding precisely, I might as well 
complain a bit.  ;)

B) I promise not to get offended that you try to update me on the current 
state of techno by bringing up a mix that's 3 years old.

C) For me, that mix fails as a listening cd, it has iffy continuity, and 
wouldn't do it for me on the dancefloor either.  It's "martini techno", 
and that last track on there makes me want to scratch my eyes out.  I fail 
to consider it coincedence that AB decides to include the two genres that 
were blowing up at the time in Europe (microhouse/minimal and progressive) 
as the two influences he "brings to the techno table" on a mix cd series 
that could have opened him to an audience well beyond those who know his 
techno work.  The Fabric series has produced some great mixes, but that's 
not one of them IMHO (Akufen's set minus the Senor Coconut track is a 
great cd to work to, and I really like the recent Robert Hood one as 
well).

D) On the "Techno's changed" thing... plenty of records came out in the 
late 90s from San Jose/SF that had that sorta proggy/housey vibe mixed 
with techno sound design and flow.  My buddy Lucas Roddenbush was part of 
the SJ techno cabal, and he was one of the more noted pioneers of the 
Tech-house movement (along with Alexi Delano, John Selway, etc... all of 
whom he worked with, I've met, etc).  The minimal/microhousey elements 
have been around a while too; Basic Channel/Chain Reaction, and a TON of 
the early detroit artists drew the template for that as early as 93 or so 
as a reaction to the hard rave cheese that techno was becoming.  A few 
years later we also saw SF as one of the epicenters of the glitch 
movement, which gave birth to the minimal/micro stuff, especially the use 
of sinewy sine-wave subs and using extremely short bits of sampled audio 
to suggest sounds rather than be too literal, and packing on the effects 
to fill the gap.  Do the later iterations of it bring something to the 
table?  Of course they do, I love having Akufen, Villalobos, Timeblind, 
JKC, Deadbeat, Monolake, Pole and a lot of that stuff around... but I also 
don't play it out cause it's more background music and I'm just too much 
of a rave bitch wannabe superstar has-been to play background music (and 
if I do I have way more proper ambient, which makes people lay down make 
out and that's more fun to watch).

I've actually produced and even released some minimal/glitch (Open Mind 
Insert Foot on this compilation 
http://doboxrecordings.com/db/index.php/releases/dbdf006/ comes to mind).  
I've also helped other minimal/glitch freaks get their Max/MSP & Reaktor 
patches working, etc.  It's not that I hate the genre wholesale, just 
don't call it techno without a hyphen or qualifier, and don't call it 
dance music unless you could foreseably break a sweat or move both feet 
and arms to it (the "minimal zombie dance" of one hand sort of doing 
non-descript stuff, other holding a beer while sorta wobbling and 
shuffling feet does not qualify).  It's as related to techno as it is to 
Eno style ambient or Steve Reich or mellower Kraftwerk or Amber-era 
Autechre (all of which are considered *ambient*), yet it seems to have 
hijacked the "techno" name outright.

And finally a moment to discuss Skweee.  I've heard some of it.  The good 
stuff sounds like raw weird electro or techno and is actually quite fun.  
The bad stuff never should have been put out, it's SHOCKINGLY 
"my_first_track.rns" bad.  Don't think it warrants a whole new genre name 
though.  I think terms like Skweee (quirky lo-fi techno/electro with some 
r&b/pop ideas) and Schranz (which is EXACTLY like early UR or Axis and 
it's legion of imitators at their most ass reamingly hardest + maybe some 
cheesy influence from um, gabber) are more marketing than anything else... 
they're not reflective of a sound as much as a scene and a desire to 
differentiate by people who know more about marketing than the history of 
music.

Oh, and all this talk about Schranz made me dig up an old bookmark for the 
crappiest thing ever, but like most things, you can go so bad it becomes 
more awesome than awesome.  And this so qualifies.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: New release from The Fingermonsters + Monsta Music!

There are Monstas on the loose! They've been roaming the halls of San
Francisco's Moulton Studios complex, causing musical mischief and mayhem
wherever they go. It's time to bring you a little bit of insight into their
tech and electro house madness with Monsta Music, brought to you by The
Fingermonsters!

The Nose Candies - Gears - Monsta 003

1. Gears (Original Mix)
2. Gears (The Fingermonsters Mix)

Available now at all fine download shops, including:

Beatport - http://www.beatport.com/artist/fingermonsters

Receiving support and/or charts from:

Radio 1, John Digweed, Onionz, Miss Honey Dijon, Funky Transport, Murray
Richardson, Mazi, Special Interest, Ministry of Sound Radio, Proton Radio,
DI.FM, Danceradio, Dinamo, and many more!

Onionz - "kool trk, refreshing to hear a breakbeat :)"

Mazi - "This is so mad and out of the ordinary compared to most promos I get
I gotta play it. Good to see people are having fun in the studio again!"

Rachel Barton (Radio 1) - "A real gear changer - love the bass!"

Raymundo Rodriguez (Ministry of Sound Radio) - "This is wild and different
which is all good, can't wait to drop it on our afterparty crowd."

Tyler Stadius (Proton Radio) - "Funky, nasty & crazy!"

Royal Sapien (Proton Radio) - "It's so rare to hear new and different breaks
tracks, I love this. It's weird and quirky -- a PERFECT fit for my sets!"

Robin Munro (Fresh Air) - "The oddest but most interesting promo i've
received in ages. Love it!"

Worried about Monstas attacking you in the night? Eating you and your
children? Protect yourself with high quality Monsta Music apparel available

Be nice.

There are a number of us here that are on Bayraves. I'd like to 
think we behave a little bit better here, well...except for 
the DC transplants ;-)

Let's not scare the children.

this usually goes up on tribe as an event listing and blog, i put it on fac=
ebook and groundscore for the first time, and i have an email list through =
addictech. and now, it's on sfraves.

i just asked the
best question in the world for prompting psychotic giggles.... are they
bringing out the blue or the purple turbos? but that is really for part
3 and this is only part 2. hard as it is not to fast forward i'm going
to take this weekend one night at a time, or i might embarrass myself.
again.
=A0
FRIDAY
one of the great
things about deciding to go big? going big. start the night off early
in the upper haight enjoying the fabulous world of art and fashion with
the traditional friday evening art opening. at pandora's trunk. 544
haight st. @ fillmore. and then.....
=A0
=A0
-TRBL
Anu 6th @ Market
10pm-2am free
=A0
continue the
pre-party with the fringe crew at their monthly TRBL. posse up with the
crew and catch some sweet beats courtesy of TRBL djs Tim Dietz and
absurge and their guests Mycho Cocoa and AudioVoid. then....
=A0
=A0
-hobo tea
1015 Folsom
10pm-? $20
=A0
i hate parties
without names so i made one up. not quite sure where to start with this
one. they're keeping 1015 intimate, 2 rooms and the line-up, from
beginning to end is not to be missed. they're making the front room a
chill lounge. they're specially tunin the sound in the main room for
maximum bass deliverance.=A0 it'll rival that night my
friends dragged me kicking and screaming to 1015 at, like, 10:15 (who
goes there before 12?) and having one of those aurally pristine nights
that are really really hard to end. anyways, here's the line-up. you'll
understand what i mean...
=A0
TIPPER
OOAH
ORGASMITRON
BEATS ANTIQUE
EPROM
HEYOKA


and then..... sunrise somewhere beautiful.=20



peace love and beats- layla

Subject: [sfraves] this is how i do

this usually goes up on tribe as an event listing and blog, i put it on facebook and groundscore for the first time, and i have an email list through addictech. and now, it's on sfraves.

i just asked the
best question in the world for prompting psychotic giggles.... are they
bringing out the blue or the purple turbos? but that is really for part
3 and this is only part 2. hard as it is not to fast forward i'm going
to take this weekend one night at a time, or i might embarrass myself.
again.
 
FRIDAY
one of the great
things about deciding to go big? going big. start the night off early
in the upper haight enjoying the fabulous world of art and fashion with
the traditional friday evening art opening. at pandora's trunk. 544
haight st. @ fillmore. and then.....
 
 
-TRBL
Anu 6th @ Market
10pm-2am free
 
continue the
pre-party with the fringe crew at their monthly TRBL. posse up with the
crew and catch some sweet beats courtesy of TRBL djs Tim Dietz and
absurge and their guests Mycho Cocoa and AudioVoid. then....
 
 
-hobo tea
1015 Folsom
10pm-? $20
 
i hate parties
without names so i made one up. not quite sure where to start with this
one. they're keeping 1015 intimate, 2 rooms and the line-up, from
beginning to end is not to be missed. they're making the front room a
chill lounge. they're specially tunin the sound in the main room for
maximum bass deliverance.  it'll rival that night my
friends dragged me kicking and screaming to 1015 at, like, 10:15 (who
goes there before 12?) and having one of those aurally pristine nights
that are really really hard to end. anyways, here's the line-up. you'll
understand what i mean...
 
TIPPER
OOAH
ORGASMITRON
BEATS ANTIQUE
EPROM
HEYOKA


and then..... sunrise somewhere beautiful. 



peace love and beats- layla

lol... that's just tonight. i have separate bsps for last night and tomorrow night through sunday night. and if i make it the sunrise spot is amazing. but a very limited capacity renegade that i didn't want to put out to the world willy nilly. 

really, this was in response to the discussion on how to promote. people read my stuff cause it's a little more interesting creative and fun, though sometimes very long winded, than the average bsp. and i meet people at parties who hear someone call my name and thank me for doing it. which means that it works.

Aw, come on Terry. . . If you can't make fun of someone who's not aware of
the difference between 'our' and 'are' on this list, who CAN you make fun
of?

Besides, my post was totally NOT sarcastic, I was just trying to see if I
had found someone to take E and wear big pants with.

Might I ask why you don't do tech stuff?  Do you have an interest in it?  Would you do it if you were qualified?  Do you feel like you could learn if you put your mind to it?

You seem like a smart guy, Marco.  The tech industry is *BOOMING* right now, despite the poor economy.  If you know linux, you have people sitting at your doorstep waiting for you to get home to offer you a job.

If you are interested and motivated, I can give you direction on what to study, and where to study.

Take a look at www.vtc.com and see if you like it.  Watch a couple chapters on Win2k3 or Active Directory, or Linux (I'd recommend watching the Red Hat Certified Technician training class to start).

Best of luck, prayers with you.

It's not that I  I "don't do tech"=2C so much as I don't have that much tec=
hnical experience. What little I do have I'd even need refresher work on as=
 it's been a couple of years since I had to do much in the way of tech-supp=

My problem(s) with learning the whole tech thing are these:=20

1. I need to stay at *LEAST* at my current pay rate. If I get into an entry=
 level tech position=2C I backpedal on payrate by a minimum of about $5-$6 =
an hour. Not acceptable. In fact=2C I almost need that much MORE than I cur=
rently pull down in order to get back on track financially...unless of cour=
se I could luck upon a nice loan to pay off my debt. Sadly my credit rating=
 won't allow for that and I don't know a soul willing (or able) to co-sign =
one for me.=20

2. To get certed for ANYTHING would cost me money I don't have=2C so while =
I could potentially sit at home and do nothing but study shit=2C I wouldn't=
 have any certs or be able to put it on a resume as experience.

3. I need almost every free minute I have to job search=2C and then once I =
find one I need to sink all my time and energy into it so I can get my ass =
back out of the hole I am currently residing in.

Could I learn tech shit? Hell yea=2C with the exception of coding=2C I find=
 most of it fairly easy to understand=2C especially if I have seen it done =
once or twice. Do I have an interest in it? Of course...in this day and age=
 it's almost required=2C isn't it? Would I do it if I was qualified? Of cou=
rse - it would obviously mean way more money. Again=2C refer to aforementio=
ned points as to why I haven't already gone that route.=20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: SMall request ...

My company is hiring CSRs and managers.  Unfortunately, our warehouse  
and call center are in Texas. The San Francisco office is mainly  
engineers and merchandisers.  But if you have friends or family in the  
Dallas area and are considering relocating...

... I'm assuming not though.  After all, who would want to goto Texas,  
once you've seen California?

City College is $20 per credit.  I'm working towards my CCNA there  
myself.  It's a good, well-equipped, program.  And they have both  
night and saturday classes so it won't interfere with your work  
schedule.  Considering how much of a pay bump that is, it may be worth  
breaking down and putting it on a card.  The new program even puts all  
the course materials online, so there's no added cost for the  
textbooks. Plus, there's financial aid.  Yes, even City College is  
eligible for it.  I don't know the details because I never bothered.   
But it's all over their website.  Fall semester is in registration now.

I don't even HAVE the thing yet, and I've had a couple of people  
approach me about my impending shift from QA to IT.  That IPv6  
transition is looming on the horizon getting ready to drop on  
everyone's heads, after all.

If you don't want to put the classes on a card and run up more debt,  
and can't afford $120 per semester, you might consider picking up a  
second job at a Starbucks.  I worked at one for a while during the  
hardcore tech doldrums.  And it's not a bad deal at all.

If you work more than 20 hours a week, you qualify for full benefits.   
So that takes care of your health coverage right there; and for your  
other job you can pick one with no bennies and a few more bucks per  
hour.  You get some miscellaneous other perks, including a fantastic  
discount at 24-Hour Fitness.  Those free pounds of coffee every week  
make for great low-cost gifts.  (Who doesn't like coffee, after all?)   
All the free coffee you can drink yourself.  If you work closings and  
have a cool manager, you can eat well on the leftovers.  And here's  
the kicker:  once you've been there for a while, they do TUITION  
REIMBURSEMENT.

And no, that's not just tuition reimbursement for food service related  
certs.  They'll cover tech certs and general degree programs as well.

Busting ass and working two jobs is never fun; especially when you're  
going to school too.  But get a couple of tech certifications under  
your belt, and your worries will be over.  I think that's the biggest  
mistake I ever made after the dotcoms collapsed... not getting my ass  
own right back into school ASAP.


cya,
john

I have a girlfriend who used to have a number that spelled out 420-DUDE,
which I always thought was a good one.

Wise advice here.  I can also give you the Boson Netsim collection so you can learn and do simulations of router/switch configs for different situations.

You just need to be willing to put in the time.

City College is $20 per credit.  I'm working towards my CCNA there  
myself.  It's a good, well-equipped, program.  And they have both  
night and saturday classes so it won't interfere with your work  
schedule.  Considering how much of a pay bump that is, it may be worth  
breaking down and putting it on a card.  The new program even puts all  
the course materials online, so there's no added cost for the  
textbooks. Plus, there's financial aid.  Yes, even City College is  
eligible for it.  I don't know the details because I never bothered.   
But it's all over their website.  Fall semester is in registration now.

I don't even HAVE the thing yet, and I've had a couple of people  
approach me about my impending shift from QA to IT.  That IPv6  
transition is looming on the horizon getting ready to drop on  
everyone's heads, after all.

If you don't want to put the classes on a card and run up more debt,  
and can't afford $120 per semester, you might consider picking up a  
second job at a Starbucks.  I worked at one for a while during the  
hardcore tech doldrums.  And it's not a bad deal at all.

If you work more than 20 hours a week, you qualify for full benefits.   
So that takes care of your health coverage right there; and for your  
other job you can pick one with no bennies and a few more bucks per  
hour.  You get some miscellaneous other perks, including a fantastic  
discount at 24-Hour Fitness.  Those free pounds of coffee every week  
make for great low-cost gifts.  (Who doesn't like coffee, after all?)   
All the free coffee you can drink yourself.  If you work closings and  
have a cool manager, you can eat well on the leftovers.  And here's  
the kicker:  once you've been there for a while, they do TUITION  
REIMBURSEMENT.

And no, that's not just tuition reimbursement for food service related  
certs.  They'll cover tech certs and general degree programs as well.

Busting ass and working two jobs is never fun; especially when you're  
going to school too.  But get a couple of tech certifications under  
your belt, and your worries will be over.  I think that's the biggest  
mistake I ever made after the dotcoms collapsed... not getting my ass  
own right back into school ASAP.

Subject: [sfraves] short term, or longer, sublet available in creative and fun mission
 household

We'll have a room available for sublet VERY soon, and I'm hoping someone
in the community could be looking.  Rent is $600/mo, or $200/wk, which 
includes utilities.

It's one room in large communal house.  It's LARGE!  It's also 
furnished.

Shared kitchen and living room.
Balcony with a view and lots of plants.

The people living here are friendly, creative types, which include
artists, designers, dancers, musicians, etc. Bicyclist friendly.
No TV watchers in the house. (We do watch movies though.)  We also have
2 very friendly cats.

Available for short to multi-month terms.

Hope to hear from some interesting folks!

Holt is mixing live for you on Monday, from 9AM-12PM.


Epiphany of Sound with J.C. - Th 9AM-12PM Pacific/US
----------------------------------------------------

After 14 years, DJ J.C.'s techno/house/electronica showcase has
garnered much attention and devotion. Like most folks at Stanford's
radio station, he's a volunteer, proving that his motivation isn't
a paycheck; it's his passion to share his interest in one of music's
most eclectic genres. With his conversational style, inclusion of
producers and musicians from both the local & international scene,
and his stewardship of the station's 24-hour marathons during
Solstices and Equinoxes, it's no wonder that DJ J.C has made a
connection with listeners in a very crowded market. Catch his live
broadcasts or listen to the previous week's program at underheard.org.

I've been using the WHLB's for several years now, and they are by far the
best needles I've had the pleasure of using.

Big fan o' the Whitelabels=2C but I also love some good ol' Ortofon Nightli=
fe's as well...the only other carts/needles I'll fuck with beyond those are=
 Shure M-447's - but they are primarily meant for scratching. They track we=

The whitelabels seem to be the standard from DJs I've watched, the rest tend to
be other things they settle for/can afford.  Stanton Trackmasters, Ortofon
Concorde Nightclub E, Stanton 500s (may not track quite as well) are popular
choices too but apparently suffer from wear and stuff.

Whitelabels are on sale for $80 each on the link I posted.  I ordered some yesterday.

Thanks for the feedback everyone!

Back in the day when I lived in Palo Alto in the late 1990s my # then was
650-321-CASH.

Hated giving that up in a move in the days when you couldn't port yr #.

Now as far as this particular # goes....

me damn it me me me me

give it to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!

that # should be mine, mine

ALL mine.

never mind my b-day is the same as Alexander Graham Bell's, (telephone
inventor 4 u YouTube kids), and that I worked at AdultFriendFinder on the
Abuse Desk and smoke copious amounts of the herb...

No, none of that.

The main qualifier is this email addy which has been subbed to sfr since
gmail was by invite only.

That alone should put me in the top slot for possession of that which is
rightfully mine.

That and I am a complete and total Kentucky stir-fried Day-Glo phareak,
here's my dating pic:   http://tinyurl.com/69y48m

Go ahead and laff all u want, u have *no idea* how much play I've gotten out
of that one pic, especially considering I grew that bad boy myself in my
gf's garden.

It's the 'make 'em laff and you're halfway there' ice-breaker from hell.

:-P

 I settle for the Ortofon blue. These needles tend to be very neutral to many different turntable settings and are not too agressive so, your record sound quality last longer. The M44 and white lable are probably some of the best tracking and sounding needles, even better that Ortofons (when settings on tables are optimum) but, better tracking and lounder needles come at a price, of your vinyl. 
Just as a footnote; Sure head shell needles didnt get where they are now without the help of Q-bert. He pushed for developement and upgrading design by Sure.? When they stoped further research of needles, this is when Q-bert went to Ortofon.

Whitelabels are on sale for $80 each on the link I posted.  I ordered some 
yesterday.

Thanks for the feedback everyone!

"better tracking and lounder needles come at a price, of your vinyl."

That's one of the reasons I like serato so much. I can play with the best
sounding and tracking needles and not have to worry about my vinyl. :-D

Hey everyone. There's a dance workshop coming up that some of the people who
work at Cafe Gratitude are putting on. (me included) It's called Body Choir,
and it's kinda a combination of Contact improve, Gabrielle Roth's 5 Rhythm
practice, and native american ritual dance. There are body choir groups all
over the world, and this is a workshop that introduces the practice. There
will be weekly dances held immediately after the workshop.

Here's what the flyer says, " Body Choir is an introspective and
interpersonally guided educational experience, inspired by the foundational
work of Gabrielle Roth's 5 Rhythm practice, Jospeh Campbell's archetypes,
and Native American ritual dance. Our doors are open to everyone seeking a
uniquely guided dance experience of raising inner awareness through
exploration of moverment and sound in the body. We welcome a wide range of
ethnicities, abilities and ages. Come help us build a community.

Subject: [sfraves] DJ MISJAH @ 222 Hyde st. july 22nd

 Throughout the entire time i've been djing and buying techno music i've 
been wanting to see this guy play.  I have to hand it to blipswitch for 
bringing him out to SF and Anatoli Russki for bringing him out to 
headline in Miami.

For me, Misjah is up there with Adam Beyer, Joel Mull, DJ Hell, 
Alexander Kowalski and Sven Vath in the top ten can't miss DJs and 
producers. To have kenneth graham and alland in support, this is going 
to fuuhhking rock!

Small, cool spot, great sound, inexpensive drinks, amazing flatbread pizza, vibey, gets hot and hard to navigate when really packed, but always a good time.

Check out our happy hour this Friday for a good intro- Dinner Party Records does every 3rd Friday, 6-10, bumpin, free.  WOOT

everyone i know that has been there pretty much LOVES the 222.

brick interior, very intimate, basement houseparty feel.

nice staff, good sound, just overall a cool little spot.

it's honestly about my favorite venue in the city for small events.

there's pics of the venue on their myspace profile, here...

http://www.myspace.com/222hyde

recommended. check it out.

Here's how the figures add up, just for Americans. The wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq have thus far produced 300,000 psychological
casualties, 320,000 brain injury casualties, plus 35,000 (probably
understated) officially reported "normal" casualties. This adds up to
655,000 US casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan, an average of just
under 101,000 Americans killed or wounded every year since the wars
began. If the idea of 101,000 casualties for every extra year in Iraq
and Afghanistan gets out and infects the voting public, imagine the
effect on the currently torpid national debate over leaving in five
years versus fifteen years!

re: why sunday?

mezzanine booked the show, and kontrol was asked to support.

shows happen on sundays cuz sometimes that's the only time the artists are
available!   odds are, booka shade are playing somewhere on the west coast
(seattle, la, etc) on friday and saturday, and were looking for a sunday gig
to fill out their schedule.

since artists will usually drop their fees a bit for a non-weekend gig, and
there's often not as much competition on those nights, some times it makes
sense to do these kinda shows on a sunday (or weds, or whatever).

often the choice is, sunday show, or no show at all.  they went with the
show option!

that's life sometimes, right?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: some upcoming club and UG events in the bay

Yes totally makes perfect sense!! (and yes always go for the show vs no show...) 
LOL - all this means to me is I'm sick or N\A come Monday (or kind of hazy - hmm ok no biggy just like every other Monday). 
I've been looking forward for this one for a while, and with a Live P.A. hope they kick ass live just like they do in the studio!!

Cheers and again many thanks for posting!!

 Not mention that you can up order up some pizza with $2 PBR. My personal favorite drink there is Abscent shaken in sugar, water, and ice. Then strained into a double shot glass. Don't let the taste deceive you because you will end up on the floor if you have too many. Not a recommended drink for those that get drunk fast!!!!

still too small for that line up. it's a cool little spot. but always 
crowded. it f'n goes off though. i'd rather see it in a better 
neighborhood. but it does remind me of the tenderloft/IK days. the 
graffiti (well styled and refined SF handstyles.. i think i saw 
'earsnot' there..?) and the pizza is an added plus.

I love how they had to float the couch on huge bricks of vibration dampers so that it wouldn't be uncomfortable to sit in. 

"Oh-a no, Giuseppe, I can't-a feel-a my feet-a!"

"You think you-a got it bad, Tony!  All-a my fillings just-a fell out."

"This-a truly is a weapon of-a bass destruction"

"I-a wonder how-a long 'til the Americans-a bomb us?"

Howdy folks,

Do people still plan their partying in advance?  We didn't think so, but
last time we dropped the word the week of an underground party we got a
couple of replies that peeps would like more notice.  We have assumed it
best to just make one post as not to spam.

More info will be posted the week of the events.

Keep raving!!

July 26, Rock It Science presents Dirty Secrets

Underground loft party with Anthony Mansfield, Andrew Phelan, Homero
Espinosa, Eric Sharp, Michael Anthony, Lachlan Scotland, and White Girl Lust

August 9th, .dotbleep Invades San Francisco presented by Rock It Science and
Temple Nightclub

Limited $10 earlybird advance tickets available at
http://www.going.com/dotbleepsf

See you folks on the dancefloor soon!

If anyone can help...

My landlord neglected to fix a leaky toilet in my unit back in February. I =
reported it the moment it was noticed=2C and he took a couple of months to =
fix it. I paid my water bill for the beginning of the year=2C but apparentl=
y he was disputing the total with SPEC=2C and got them to adjust it (I gues=
s it got pretty astronomical).=20

A couple of weeks ago he slammed me and my roomie with an "adjusted" bill f=
rom those months. An additional $265 over what I had already paid for a wat=
er bill.  Due to the fact that my last rent check was super late=2C we agre=
ed to pay the bill....but we mentioned that during half of the billing cycl=
e there were two other tenants living here (my ex roommates)=2C and that it=
 seemed like they ought to be liable for their portion.

My questions:=20

A. Is it fair or legal for him to charge us my ex-roomies portion?

B. Is it fair or legal for him to charge us an adjusted amount over what wa=
s already paid due to his negligence in fixing the problem?=20

I suggest that you look into a free legal clinic, if it's worth it to you.

You might try the SF Bar Association's Legal Advice and Referral Clinic
(LARC):
http://www.sfbar.org/volunteer/larc.aspx

Apparently their next clinic is on July 26. I don't know how long you might
expect to spend there, but generally it helps to show up early during the
registration period.

Good luck...

Damon

Who's name is on the lease?  The leaseholder is liable for any fees and charges specified in the lease.

But no he can't charge you for water use due to a leak due to a reported problem he didn't fix assuming you reported it to him.  Our landlord has been trying this for two years now and my wife totally slammed him on it.

There are strict rules about passing on increased water bills to tenants in San Francisco.  Your landlord will have to document the increase by presenting past bills.  Contact the SF rent board for more information.

Both my name and my roomies name are on the current lease. But again, this covers a period that two other leaseholders were on the lease as well.  

I have email documentation of notifying him of the leaky toilet, and it took him almost two months to fix it. Just seems totally illegal for him to charge us now, and not at the very least pursue the other two leaseholders portion for the time they were occupying the residence.

That's because you are not 55 and loving life as much as ever -
Dina, at 40, already knows all about how to do that -
most people never figure it out - all that responsibility
and freedom - hopelessly intertwined . . .

why?

i was just stating what i would do. afterall jack benny declared he was 
39 for the rest of his life. age is all relevant.  its all about how 
young you feel or think you are.

i'm f'n 30 and everybody still thinks i'm 25... of course i'm keeping 
that shit on the low. it's the ellis dee  that keeps me young. TRUE DAT. 
lol happy birthday dina if i hadn't said it before. `;P

The liberties of our country, the freedoms of our civil Constitution
are worth defending at all hazards; it is our duty to defend them
against all attacks. We have received them as a fair inheritance from
our worthy ancestors. They purchased them for us with toil and danger
and expense of treasure and blood. It will bring a mark of everlasting
infamy on the present generation, enlightened as it is, if we should
suffer them to be wrested from us by violence without a struggle, or
to be cheated out of them by the artifices of designing men.

- Samuel Adams

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: weird kids tv

if you think that's weird check out this e inspired show for kids.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF_NdhbFg8U&feature=related
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ijIOFbXp_A&feature=related


when the summer of love was more than a decade ago in england it will be 
natural for some tweakyness to trickle down into society. who can't 
admit either that sesame street wasn't inspired by the 60's 
counterculture's own summer of love?

i think its nautral for people to have these warm open hearted feelings 
for children once people have consumed psychedelics of any sort.

Subject: [sfraves] Thanks! was Re: [sfraves] we should ALL be ashamed of ourselves

Thanks for all the Bday wishes gang.

I was never one to taught what year I was born in - I never really figured 
numbers meant much, especially in this circle (...and hell at 60, my mom 
still gets carded in dark places) so being outed on the year I turn 40 don't 
bother me none.  Nobody seems to believe it anyway (including myself), so 
more power to me, I say...

As for you youngins freaking out on me in private on how "old" you're 
surprised to find out I am, I'm still the same person and figure I'm living 
proof that you can stop the aging process on many degrees.  And screw the 
numbers....

For most who choose to actually go out and live, "age" brings about it 
wisdom, and yeah Ray, the ablility to drink great big men under the table... 
and a whole lotta memories - but let's not fiddle... I'm just getting 
started....

again... thanks y'all...

now back to my nap...

LOL

3) Special guest act is scheduled to play 1:30 - 2:30 in the main room, however "it" will not be announced until tomorrow- by word of mouth only!

Since yer so hard pressed, I've got a quote for ya from Mike D. of the
Beastie Boys from a live interview they gave on the kick off of their tour
for "To The 5 Boroughs" album at radio station in Washington DC's Chinatown
on 7th St off of H Street in October of 2004.

"As we approach the election, do you have anything to say about this
Administration?"

Mike D.:

"Yeah, Busch *sucks.*"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: ALL FUNKIN' NIGHT! TOMORROW! (+ updates)

OK... I'm also gonnabe celebrating the start of my birthday celebration on
Sat night... yeah 'cause I mean... I figure I always do a long celebration
after the fact.. so why not Before the actual!

Yeah... I'm also gonna be "hosting" the Yummy Grown Shindig too... I'm not
sure exactly what that means quiet yet... but I guess I will be giving out
stuff from a grab bag, flying around the party on my magic carpet, &
givin' out some hugs :)

Man, I am wiped after being at tonight's killswitch the entire time (needed
to setup and break down all the visuals gear).  Hope I'm feeling recovered
enough tomrrow for what's sure to be a hell of a time but given it's 5am
and I'm still awake, seems unlikely for me. :-(

(aka the guy with the nice hazer and a table and the ability to remember
how to not destroy the multi-hundred$ video cable at the end of the night)

Sorry I won't be making it tonight.

I was visiting my client up in Tahoe and took a nasty spill in 
their hotel. Ended up with paramedics, a busted open chin 
requiring stitches, a mild concussion, and various other 
not-so-pleasant injuries.

I just got back, but I gotta take it easy for a day or 10. I 
haven't skipped out on doing visuals in a very long time, hope 
my excuse is good enough. Thanks Chuck for tracking me down and 
expressing your concern.

I got to see the space last week though, it's really unique. 
It's gonna be an awesome party :-)

I was visiting my client up in Tahoe and took a nasty spill in 
their hotel. Ended up with paramedics, a busted open chin 
requiring stitches, a mild concussion, and various other 
not-so-pleasant injuries.

I just got back, but I gotta take it easy for a day or 10. I 
haven't skipped out on doing visuals in a very long time, hope 
my excuse is good enough. Thanks Chuck for tracking me down and 
expressing your concern.

I got to see the space last week though, it's really unique. 
It's gonna be an awesome party :-)

Sorry I won't be making it tonight.

I was visiting my client up in Tahoe and took a nasty spill in 
their hotel. Ended up with paramedics, a busted open chin 
requiring stitches, a mild concussion, and various other 
not-so-pleasant injuries.

I just got back, but I gotta take it easy for a day or 10. I 
haven't skipped out on doing visuals in a very long time, hope 
my excuse is good enough. Thanks Chuck for tracking me down and 
expressing your concern.

I got to see the space last week though, it's really unique. 
It's gonna be an awesome party :-)

Subject: [sfraves] WR: So Yummy All Fuckin' Night!!!!

ok... so like lol.. to get to the venue was a journey... I rode BART & a
guy who smelled like pepperoni pizza sat in front of me then his small
kinda shifted to something rank... then i caught Muni which actually took
me deeper into the City & further away from my destination to catch a bus
that went to the venue... lol.. so yeah... mondo confuzion... then since i
didn't have a cell phone on me.. it took 1/2 an hour until I met residents
who live in the hood to call Chuckie for me so I wouldn't hold their his
phone & yeah... it was kinda weird, but yeah... got there finally!

But yeah... oooh.. ok.. so the venue is like so Awesome!!  I mean...
small, not your typical kinda ummm... space i guess... but it like
heeeeella reminded me of all the old school like undergrounds that like
were in office building & stuff kinda dealie :)  ooh.. 1 of my highlights
was get worked on from a Chiropractor & oooh.. he fixed me sooo good!!! 
YUM!!!

OK... I also gotta say that this was seriously like an unofficial SFR
party 'cause sooo many SFR heads showed up.. seriously.. if this was back
in the day, like Lida & Tina woulda busted out an SFR meet up table or
something... lol :)  But yeah... it was Dope!  Grrr... i wish i got pixes
of you all.. but umm... yeah

OK... the music was Sick... i mean... Jungle for opening a fuckin' room?? 
Hell fuckin' yeah man!!!  I mean.. i still mondo HATE PINKKO w/ the
passion (lol... jk... i don't), but fuck yeah... he started out all Liquid
Funky.. then his set just got all i dunno... more yummy!!!  I dunno man..
the music was Awesome.. I mean... I heard alota yummy house in the main
room & y'all know how picky i am about my house... so yeah.. I was
Groovin' hard... all the music I heard man... fuck yeah!!  I'm sorry Peter
I didn't get to like see you drop ch00nage.. but yeah.. the co-hosting
dealie was like confuzing at 1st!


Oooh yeah... so like yeah... I was the Free goodies give away dude... like
I tried reeeeeally hard to get everyone w/ a necklace or a CD or a lighter
& luckily.. maybe 4-5 people who i showed too much Love to I gave like all
4 things... but yeah... lol... it was fun giving out presents to people!! 
So Dope!!!

As soon as my bag-o-goodies ran out.. i mean.. i was suppose to like
refill & stock up w/ like more stuff... but ummm... 1/2 birthday present
#1
& 1/2 Birthday present #2 started havin' this hardcore jungle shindig in
my body & head... so ummm, yeah, Hello 2Day... i kinda needed to ride that
instead of like ummm... being Santa Raver... & yeah... everyone who gave
me 1/2 Birthday gifts... ooh my goodness.. Tahnk Y'all so much.. I mean..
i'm havin' the hangover from hell right & loading up on my water/ caffine
in take... but yeah... Oooh fuck yeah.. Love U all sooo much!!!  LoL!!! 
Yeah.. everyone there lastnight... Big Love!!!

Oh yeah... the start of the night, like a bus load of Candy kids were 1st
to get there... it was Cute 'cause there were already high & suckin' on
their pacifires! :)  I mean.. the crowd was pretty mixed.. there was even
a group of I odnt give a fuck Neo NAzi skin punkrockers that showed up & I
mean.. they were kindfa rude.. but there was just sooo much goo d energy
that no one paid mind to them :)  But yeah... it was good energy all
night!!!  Loved it!!!

I mean... what sucked hard donkey balls was that I mean.. the party ended
a lil early shavin' off 2 sets 'cause cops showed up... but I mean... the
vibe of the party was so strong & as the venue owner said, "... it was the
peak of the party & the energy and the vibes were really strong, that the
party ended at the right moment 'cause if it went on any longer, there
would of been an energy fizzle"... so yeah... so Dope!!!  I mean...
regardless... it was a perfect night!!!

Yo Chuckie... seriously HomiE... big fuckin' ups dude on pulling this
off... you set out on a mission to make people happy all fuckin' night &
everyone was!!  You went above & beyond the call of Dutie & even though
Mister "I'm 34 yrs old & I know what's goin' on here", fresh outta the cop
academy police officer ended things a wee lil earlier than planned, people
still had sooo much fun!!  You did it & I'm hella proud of you man!!! 
Ooooh, & Thanks sooo much for letting me be a part of the madness!!  LoL..
Hello 2day... this underground really lifted things up in my life a few
notches & I'm afterglowin' hardcore Homie!!!  You did it!!  You seriously
really did :)

OK... I need to nurse my hangover a lil more & probs potato in front of my
TV... but fuck man... lol.. I can't stop fucin' smiling & thinkin' about
the so mondo yummy it was lastnight... but yeah... even cleaning up I was
all giggely as fuck still 'cause it was just ooh man... what i needed &
I'm sure many people left feeling the same way I still do :)

YAAAY 4 the underground!!!

 LMAO. Aww, man. Those were good times. Tina and I *totally* would have busted out the SFR name-tags, too. And I still have the "SFR IS GRATE" banner I could have hung. ;)

Sorry I missed it. I'm fighting off some kind of sickness and didn't want to push myself. Sounds like it was a great party though. Congrats on a job well done Chuckie Cheese!



 
Heart,
Alida


P.S. Osby, did you post the
pics/video from my birthday anywhere? I didn't take any pics that night
and would love any that you have. Thanks!

Subject: [sfraves] fable's funky funkn night!!

CHUCK G and his lady are the SHIT!  GOOD PEEPS.

Me and my wife arrived at the party pretty early.  It was pretty empty when we arrived, but the first person I saw sitting at the entrance was OSBY!! WOOHOO!!

Osby gave me a big ass hug and finally got to meet my wife for the first time.  I looked over and there was Chuck G's woman, Megan!  She was so cool and just had a good vibe which started the night off right.

First impressions of the location was a family house feel.  Very awesome, I immediately decided, that this wasn't some warehouse party, the venue needed to be treated with respect as if it was someone's home.

We finally ran into Chuck and I could tell that he was hella busy, but he still went out of his way to show us around and introduce us to some peeps.  I can't stress what cool people Chuck and his crew are, their mentality is what has kept the scene alive and positive to this day.

30 minutes passed and I had a boston lager draft in one hand and a blunt in the other.  I was in the chill room and this one dude with long hair was chillin with us in the circle.  He seemed to be part of the organizer crews cuz he was fine-tuning some of the decorations.  I ended up ashing on the floor cuz I had no where else to ash and the dude gave me the look.  I felt kinda bad, so I scooped up all my ashes with my business card and made sure I left no mess behind.

So, some sweet dnb was going in one room and house in the other.  After listening to the first few songs in the dnb room, my wife wanted to go dance in the housey type room on the bottom floor.  We started dancing and were feelin the music so much that we started doing the merengue with a little housey twist which I thought was hella dope!  Then, Osby comes over and says to us, "This isn't the lambada guys!"  Then my wife said, "I'm not Brazilian!" but I dont think he heard, haha!

Osby came by later and hooked me up with a fatty green bushy necklace that somewhat resembled herb, I had to let it hang out of my back pocket tho, cuz it was tickling my wifes face when we danced.

Sadly, we had to cut out early cuz a friend of ours got stuck without a ride.  We were bummed about this cuz things looked like they were just about to pop off! *sniff*

I was only able to say goodbye to Megan and she seems down that we left early.

Chuck, Megan and the rest of the crew, thank you so much for a dope ass night!  This wasn't just some party, it was a family affair.  

fable....

I happened to witness a bank run in Midland, Texas, one time. I?ll  
never forget the guy standing in the bank lobby saying, ?Your deposits  
are good. We got you insured. You don?t have to worry about it if you  
got less than $100,000 in the bank.? The problem was, people didn?t  
hear. And there?s a ? became a nervousness.

I was pleasantly surprised by all the different party types that showed up.
It's definitely something most parties are unable to accomplish, and don't
even try to.  You pulled it off, and it worked out well.  I was really
feelin' the stuff that Michael was layin down before I went on.  More people
need to book him for non-downtempo music!  I had originally intended to go
home around 2 and get some sleep, but I stayed til the cops showed up and
shut the party down.  I can say my only disappointment with this party was
not being able to see more than 5 minutes of the Fingermonsters!

But on the real, Chuck, you had a kickin' ass party, everyone I ran into was
enjoying themselves.  When is the next one???

Man that party was so chill yet crazy all at the same time. It was cool to actually meet some SFR peeps from the list in the real world.


Did any body catch the those dick head(s) who threw beer bottles of the roof?


Someone remind me not to try to drive into Pacifica after a party..damn that weather was freking me out!

Hooo boy...AFN was good times. I could try and write a super well thought o=
ut review=2C but it seems like most everyone who has commented touched on m=
ost of the points I woulda brought up (like the 1st cop interaction in the =
keg room that Peter mentioned...that shit was funny!)

All in all=2C despite the little kids and cops showing up twice (I'm amazed=
 it took so long the 2nd time around)=2C I thought the party rocked. The li=
neup was great=2C the genre and crowd mixing was a nice change of pace. Peo=
ple seemed very friendly overall=2C even the mini-thugs from Richmond. ( I =
wound up kind of keeping an eye on them all night after they got all riled =
up during the bottle incident=2C and for the most part they were actually p=
retty nice kids)

My set was "eh". It had moments I loved=2C and moments I hated. This was th=
e 1st event I had an honest to goodness cd malfunction...one of my tracks d=
idn't burn all the way through and just cut off mid mix...OOPS! Beyond that=
 though=2C I had fun. Peter sounded good despite the tone-arm/needle issue =
with one of his decks (good job soldiering through that!)=2C Michael's tech=
no was on point big time=2C as was Pinkko's set=2C Holt sounded really frig=
gin' good=2C and what I heard of Dean and The Fingermonsters was great too.=
 Who really impressed the fuck out of me=2C were Santiago & Bushido. They f=
ucking tore it up!!! I have never heard Chicago house sound so beast!!! The=
y need to come back...and not to another kiddy rave like they played at the=
 night before at Kelly's Mission Rock...oh no no. They need to be at a nice=
 (adult) underground=2C hahaha.=20

Man=2C I think I saw more prostitots and kiddy ravers this weekend between =
promotions and the party Saturday than I have in years. It was very strange=
.=20

My observation in regards to this...back in the day=2C kiddy ravers had big=
 fucking pants...now it seems like the style is "no fucking pants"=2C as a =
good 3/4's of those little girls were wearing nothing but panties over tigh=
ts. Had they not been mere children by most standards=2C that might have be=
en hot. But that young...it was borderline creepy.

Anyway...massive respect and props to Chuck G and Caligrown for another ama=
zing effort and heartfelt event. Chuck is hand to god one of the nicest=2C =
most sincere and genuine people I have met since moving out here=2C and I g=
ot nothing but love for what he's involved in=2C for who he hangs out with=
=2C and for him as a human being. My hat is off.....

~ Marco

p.s. It was super awesome fun time happy rave-o-matic meeting new folks lik=
e Mary & Holt=2C etc. !!!!!

Interesting, if true.

--

In fact, the Nazi Party began in a gay bar in Munich, and Ernst Roehm,
Hitler's right hand in the early days of Nazism, was well-known for
his taste in young boys. William Shirer says in his definitive "Rise
and Fall of the Third Reich," not only that Roehm was "important in
the rise of Hitler," but also "like so many of the early Nazis, (he
was) a homosexual."

I heard this over @ Marco's house the other night. Very, very FUN and funky tracks. This is one of those mixes I throw on when I'm feeling down & and need a pick-me-up. Highly recommended.

ditto, ditto, and DITTO!!

Also lots of props to Megan for supporting Chuck through the madness
of getting a party together and for managing the door.

likewise lookin' forward to more Marco meetups in the future.

Also, wanna meet the peoples I didn't get a chance to meet, the
downstairs DJs, Osby (I said hi a couple times, but we both got
busy with other things), probably others I'm forgetting.

Also, for those of you who didn't get to make friends with the
unicorn in the black light room, you still have a chance:

While looking at this, you have to listen to the unicorn song,
or else:

P.S. I'm released from any liability for damage incurred to your
psyche while you listen to the unicorn song.

Hi guys, this is Chelsea and I am in Berlin.  It's 11pm and I'm going to
Tresor in a couple hours to hear Alexander Kowalski, amongst others. The sun
has just set and I'm listening to a duduk player outside my window.
Somehow I have found myself coming all the way here to eat....
California-style burritos??

Mexican food is pretty scarce in the city, and I tend not to seek it out,
for the thought of German Mexican food does not really appeal to me.  But
here in Mitte is this burrito joint called Dolores, which specializes in
"California-style" Mexican food.  The food is okay, standard pseudo-Mexican
yuppie fare such as tofu burritos with brown rice, and of course, for that
extra touch of Bay Area authenticity, organic soy lattes. A panel of cute
and friendly German girls assemble my "Dolores Vegan" burrito for me with a
smile. But the most major "WTF" element of this place for me is the HUGE map
of the Mission covering one entire side of the restaurant.  (The food is
much more Marin than the Mission, but still....)  Much like the actual
Mission, this place is a magnet for fashionable young Americans, and
ordering your food in English is not just acceptable, but expected (perhaps
to go along with the "theme"?)  To match the Californian food, they serve
Anchor Steam beer and bottled Arizona teas imported from the States.  To me
this is very, very strange.

You can read their spunky and colorful menu here - www.dolores-berlin.de

That's all for now,

Love Chelsea

yuppie fare such as tofu burritos with brown rice, and of course, for that
extra touch of Bay Area authenticity, organic soy lattes. A panel of cute
and friendly German girls assemble my "Dolores Vegan" burrito for me with a
smile. But the most major "WTF" element of this place for me is the HUGE map
of the Mission covering one entire side of the restaurant.  (The food is
much more Marin than the Mission, but still....)  Much like the actual
Mission, this place is a magnet for fashionable young Americans, and
ordering your food in English is not just acceptable, but expected (perhaps
to go along with the "theme"?)  To match the Californian food, they serve
Anchor Steam beer and bottled Arizona teas imported from the States.  To me
this is very, very strange.

You can read their spunky and colorful menu here - www.dolores-berlin.de

That's all for now,

Love Chelsea

Hi guys, this is Chelsea and I am in Berlin.  It's 11pm and I'm going to
Tresor in a couple hours to hear Alexander Kowalski, amongst others. The sun
has just set and I'm listening to a duduk player outside my window.
Somehow I have found myself coming all the way here to eat....
California-style burritos??

Mexican food is pretty scarce in the city, and I tend not to seek it out,
for the thought of German Mexican food does not really appeal to me.  But
here in Mitte is this burrito joint called Dolores, which specializes in
"California-style" Mexican food.  The food is okay, standard pseudo-Mexican
yuppie fare such as tofu burritos with brown rice, and of course, for that
extra touch of Bay Area authenticity, organic soy lattes. A panel of cute
and friendly German girls assemble my "Dolores Vegan" burrito for me with a
smile. But the most major "WTF" element of this place for me is the HUGE map
of the Mission covering one entire side of the restaurant.  (The food is

How many camp outs have there been in 2008, at least a dozen so far it seems
like, with more to come before the year ends.  The high ticket prices of
some of these events provide exquisite deco and setups, top notch sound and
lighting, and world class talent.  For all of you that were unable to attend
all of your favorite camp outs because of financial restraints, this party
is for you- and all free party loving people everywhere!

The Acid Totem sound system returns to its renegade roots.  Imagine a party
based on the very foundation of early rave culture, the FREE SOUND SYSTEM.
Fill your car with all your friends and camping gear, and head to the
Mendocino National Forest for the first ever MENDONESIA.  A 3 hour drive
from SF, Oakland, and Sacramento, and just over 2 hours from Santa Rosa.

This is an intimate and free campout, since we aren't charging, everyone is
expected to pack out their own trash (trash bags will be provided).  There
is also extreme fire danger in the area, so no fire of any kind outside of
campsite fire rings. Pit toilets are on site, but there is no running
water.  It gets HOT here during the day, and is relatively cool at night.
Sunscreen for the daytime, and extra layers at night are recommended.  There
is plenty of shade in the campground, but early arrival is recommended to
ensure a premium site.  Did we mention there's a creek that runs right next
to the background?

Check out pix of the area:  http://www.acidtotem.net/mendonesia.htm

You can expect to hear a myriad of sounds and talented DJs from the many
subscenes of Northern California dance culture.  Party will be kicking off
Friday evening circa 6pm.

Although the party is free, donations are greatly appreciated.  Feed the
Totem god and keep him happy!


And finally, the line-up:

Subject: [sfraves] Techno Manifesto

I found this months article on pitchfork about the state of techno  
(haha!) rather entertaining, and somewhat informative (in that  
pitchfork run-on-sentence-I'm-smarter-than-you sort of way):

"...Even electronic dance music, which once spun blithely under a  
yellow smiley face, seems uncommonly sober these days-- self-critical,  
nail-biting, a buzzkill to the extreme. Minimal, of course, was the  
straw that overflowed the glass of Red Bull. Scapegoat or no, in the  
last 18 months, the ubiquitous and yet strangely ephemeral genre has  
become a lightning rod for every conceivable critique. It's too  
soulless. It all sounds the same. It's lost touch with the roots of  
"real" dance music. It might not be surprising to hear a DJ like Diplo  
tell Pitchfork, "I go to a club in Berlin and I want to kill myself."  
But even within the scene, everyone complains about minimal, leveling  
complaints that often seem indicative of a much wider unease.... "

Especially interesting are the last contribution bits from producers  
as general guidelines when creating tracks. Of course, there are no  
guidelines, but it is still an interesting take.

Big Love Show with Jack - Mon 3PM-6PM Pacific/US
------------------------------------------------

This week Jack will be hosting Rick Preston.

Whether you experience Rick Preston's Dj sets in a packed club with
half naked bodies pulsating and gyrating around you in the thick
vibe, or if its at a huge rave with lasers and thousands of heads
jumping and screaming, or at a park on that sunny afternoon with
kids and families all getting down to the funky rhythms together in
unison, its always guaranteed that you will have the biggest smile
of your face after dancing to his music.

Although he started off his career playing Disco and Funk in the
early 80's, Rick used his experience in the booming 80's alternative
scene to hone his DJing skills. Rick would be part of various
nighttime gatherings for friends in bars and night clubs, leading
their nights with swooning tunes and industrial beats. And as the
music progressed, so would Rick's attraction to what would lead to
an even bigger movement, Electronic Music.

In the early 90's, Rick became involved with promotion alongside his
frequent Dj gigs. Amongst some of the Bay Area greats, such as Jeno,
Garth, Mark Farina, Spun, and Julius Papp, Rick was helping put on
club nights and raves in their beginning stages, when the
underground at its strongest.

While his DJ sets are mostly considered deep house, they are not
limited to just the deep sound. Rick has a special flair for
bringing together a multitude of genres which can include tribal
rhythms, some tech-house, some Latin textures, a classic track or
two, or even a mind awakening spoken word.

As a producer, Preston's motto of quality not quantity has stood him
in good stead with some superb labels, notably Glasgow Underground,
home to Mateo & Matos, Romanthony, and Neon Heights. He also has
releases on AfterHours, Viva! Recordings, Freeze Records, Big Big
Trax, and BCE.

Epiphany of Sound with J.C. - Th 9AM-12PM Pacific/US
----------------------------------------------------

After 14 years, DJ J.C.'s techno/house/electronica showcase has
garnered much attention and devotion. Like most folks at Stanford's
radio station, he's a volunteer, proving that his motivation isn't
a paycheck; it's his passion to share his interest in one of music's
most eclectic genres. With his conversational style, inclusion of
producers and musicians from both the local & international scene,
and his stewardship of the station's 24-hour marathons during
Solstices and Equinoxes, it's no wonder that DJ J.C has made a
connection with listeners in a very crowded market. Catch his live
broadcasts or listen to the previous week's program at underheard.org.

J.C. will email this week if he has an update on any guests.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr bsp: live-coding presentation tomorrow night (music geeks/programmers will dig)

http://electronicmusic.meetup.com/152/calendar/8221557/

Tomorrow night I'll be back in the Bay to give a presentation on a
system I built. It has two major use cases currently. One is
generating infinite streams of ambient music, like AI windchimes, and
the other is live-coding beats, e.g.:

http://vimeo.com/947877

I did a DJ set with it also in Toronto recently at a programming
conference pre-party. Hate to say it but the set operated much better
as a technology demo than it did as an actual DJ set. Still, I DJed a
party by modifying code as it ran - not a great UI but a fantastic
proof of concept.

At some point this year or next year this system will be able to
generate infinite streams of fully-fledged techno on its own - aided
and abetted, of course, by prosumer software like Reason and Live. It
can already do infinite streams of sample-driven ambient and I've
already got outline code for features like melody and chord
progressions.

The talk is code-intensive; if you're not a programmer, you might be
bored and/or confused. There's several other interesting things
happening the same night, wicked cool music innovation, so if you dig
that kind of thing, come on by.

Tuesday @ 7:30pm at the offices of Digidesign.

Hey all, bit spammy, very sorry, but just wanted to mention, I'm also
going to pontificate a bit on my theory of the MP3-era music business.
Very much just a theory - haven't made it work yet - but it's quite
complete and forms the basis of the technology so it could be
interesting. Hope to see you there.

Heh, that's surprising. I was anything but. Threw out my back on Sunday
working on my car, so I endured a great deal of pain to play that set. I
don't even remember the last good night of sleep I got. But enough about my
problems. . . :-D

I was watching The John McCain Old Man's Channel, Turner Classic Movies,
this past weekend and they were having themselves an Annette
Funicello/Frankie Avalon Beach Blanket Bingo movie marathon over there for
all the old folk that wanted to relive the glory days of their
pre-psychedelic youth and during the Muscle Beach Party movie, which came
out in 1964.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058384/ my jaw just dropped when
out of the blue, an insanely young Stevie Wonder came out of nowhere and did
a song.

Totally mind blowing.

Little Stevie Wonder, (that's how he's credited in his first ever feature
film appearance, check the IMDB link above), is like all of14 yrs old at the
time of the filming and they've got him singing not only in the movie but
over the closing credits as well, which is a real head twist because the
entire rest of the flick is nothing but Dick Dale and The Mighty Del Tones
surf music.

And really, really, rilly bad acting.

If you ever spot it on the TV dial it's worth watching the closing credits
just for that.

a few years=2C her skills had already landed her numerous residencies in Sa=

Ace Tatsu (Bassyx.org)

DJ Ace Tatsu relocated to San Francisco in 1996=2C from Brooklyn=2C NY=2C w=
here he was born and raised. New to the city=2C he started exploring San Fr=
ancisco's famous nightlife=2C discovering new restaurants=2C lounges and da=
nce clubs on a regular basis. Having traveled a good portion of the world e=
arly on in his ventures =2C provided Ace with a grander view of what life h=
ad to offer=2C but there was something magnetically appealing about San Fra=
ncisco that kept him in this city. A place so rich in culture and diversity=
. Soul and creativity oozing from every corner. Intertwined and amplified s=
o richly by its inhabitants through music. In recollection=2C the first tim=
e the sound captivated him=2C Ace was listening to 'Mushroom Jazz' by Mark =
Farina. It was a sound that was soulful=2C deep and took you away on a magi=
cal journey. From that point on=2C music was no longer a sound=2C but a des=
tination. It was the rich soulful feeling that radiated from this music tha=
t eventually translated into a passion=2C leaving Ace wanting to learn more=
 about the process of melding these audible delights together=2C and creati=
ng that same feeling he felt that day for others. Using a pair of turntable=
s his Brother loaned him=2C and a Mixer from Dj Kimani=2C he began his ques=
t into the realm of Deep House Music.

As San Francisco's DJ culture erupted=2C Ace gained extensive exposure to o=
ther mixing styles ranging from Hip Hop and Mash ups to Breaks=2C Progressi=
ve house and Trance and experimenting with all. A huge influence in his ear=
ly stage of music=2C an old friend DJ/Producer Jorge Torres lent a helping =
hand by rendering four crates of his own House records collection. These re=
cords were proven to be a catalyst early on in his musical venture.

In 2005=2C the passion developed into an obsession. At times=2C as though d=
riven by a spiritual force=2C the relentless urge to search for music and c=
reate journeys was unmistakable. The end of 2005 came with his first mix cd=
 release 'Love Groove' a smashing success for fans of deep sexy house music=
. Following 6 Months later was 'Love Accelerated'=2C another deep sexy soul=
ful mix=2C with a dash of international flavor.

2005 was also the year that Ace began to use Serato Scratch live in his ars=
enal=2C upon recommendation from Dj Kimani. Having looked up to his flawles=
s mixing style and genuine success as a dj=2C he knew that if Kimani was us=
ing this system=2C it must be the real deal. When asked about serato=2C Ace=
 replied "Having the ability to have your whole musical arsenal with you at=
 anytime=2C anywhere=2C allows you to work on complete artistry in your per=
formances without giving up the feel of vinyl. This is a new time and age=
=2C and the sound that will evolve from this=2C will take music lovers to n=
ew heights.

When asked about Musical selections that influenced his early style=2C Ace =
showed appreciation for Miguel Migs and the Naked Music label=2C Hedkandi=
=2C and the music played by local favorites such as Julius papp=2C Kaskade=
=2C jay j and Donovan to name a few. Other influences such as little louie =
vega=2C Dj Gregory=2C lawnchair generals=2C late night alumni=2C Jask=2C Ge=
ne Farris and Fish Go Deep played a huge part in molding his mixing charact=
er.

It wasn't long before Ace had various Residencies under his belt in the cit=

 where he was born and raised. New to the city=2C he started exploring San =

dance clubs on a regular basis. Having traveled a good portion of the world=
 early on in his ventures =2C provided Ace with a grander view of what life=
 had to offer=2C but there was something magnetically appealing about San F=
rancisco that kept him in this city. A place so rich in culture and diversi=
ty. Soul and creativity oozing from every corner. Intertwined and amplified=
 so richly by its inhabitants through music. In recollection=2C the first t=
ime the sound captivated him=2C Ace was listening to 'Mushroom Jazz' by Mar=
k Farina. It was a sound that was soulful=2C deep and took you away on a ma=
gical journey. From that point on=2C music was no longer a sound=2C but a d=
estination. It was the rich soulful feeling that radiated from this music t=
hat eventually translated into a passion=2C leaving Ace wanting to learn mo=
re about the process of melding these audible delights together=2C and crea=

[ K O N T R O L ]

minimal techno + avant-house
every 1st Saturday @ The Endup


featuring from Cologne, Germany
in an exclusive appearance:

TRIPLE R   (aka Riley Reinhold)

Traum . Trapez . MBF . Kompakt


Riley Reinhold, best known as Triple R, has been a hugely
influential figure in Germany's dance music culture for nearly
20 years.  Starting off as a DJ at early illegal parties in his
native Cologne, he soon found himself writing for top music
mags (including his own De:Bug) before going on to co-found
the revered labels Traum, Trapez, and MBF.  Between his
years at the Kompakt record shop, developing talent for his
5 labels, residencies at Cologne's best clubs, a radio show,
and organizing monthly parties, it's no wonder he's
practically considered a national treasure.  This month we
are thrilled to share some of the riches with San Francisco
with an extended West Coast debut set.


with special guest:

CHRISTIAN MORA (bang the box)


and [KONTROL] residents:

ALLAND BYALLO  (nightlight music . auralism . leibe*detail)
NIKOLA BAYTALA  (s.w.a.t . robsoul . junior boys own)
CRAIG KUNA  (platform . esdjco)

TRIPLE R (aka Riley Reinhold)

Riley Reinhold (aka Triple R) is part owner of the Traum Schallplatten
family of labels encompassing Traum, Trapez and MBF. He started DJing in
1984 in Cologne and later on at electronic dance parties in 1989. Together
with Sascha K=F6sch (now Chief Editor of De:BUG) the pair assembled their o=

K=F6sch. His record reviews and articles in the biggest german indie mag SP=
EX

club in Cologne, Sensor, playing with guests such as Swayzak, Carl Craig,
Daniel Bell, Thomas Brinkmann, Miss Kittin, Richie Hawtin, Magda, Green

CHRISTIAN MORA

Christian's story has only begun to be written. After getting his start in
1995, he began to make a name for himself by playing undergound parties,
mantaining residencies, and organizing full-moon parties all across Mexico.
After making the move to San Francisco in 2000, he started working at the
now defunct Nemesis distributor, helping to service dance music stores
across the states as well as his own store Crescent Records in Guadalajara.
By melding house, tech house, techno and electro into his own signature
blend, his good ear and taste for music has allowed him to DJ not only in
Mexico, but Spain, Holland, Japan and the States. For the last couple of
years, Christian as been playing club and underground events as a member of
Bang The Box, alongside fellow San Franciscans Solar, Lance DeSardi, and
Guada. Previous Bang The Box guests have included John Tejada, Dan Curtin,
Jona, Dollz At Play, Alexkid, and Mr. C., with many more on the horizon.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

After upgrading to Vista Ultimate, which is indeed a stable and robust OS,
(unlike the pre-loaded Home Edition, hmmm), I got hit w/a piece of malware
which rendered it so buggy that I switched to running Linux Puppy/Ubuntu off
of a Live CD.

Here's the deal.

I've got about 50+ gigs of files/work that I want to preserve, that I can
see and access while running LP/U and I want to move them to a section of
the hard drive that I won't be installing XPsp3/Linux onto.

Can anyone here please point me in the right direction for a step by step
walk thru of this process?

Let me pre-empt the 'get a mac' acolytes by stating that I plan to get one
in the near future and that I'd go the pure linux route if it weren't for
the extra 15 steps I gotta take everytime I plug a new piece of HW into this
box, m'kay?

Also, I'm not too keen on burning x amount of gigs onto DVDs, in this, or
any other, lifetime.

Thanks!

~Nyc

That gag is so old it's grown whiskers:
http://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l10/baorao/nakedgun4.jpg

The Naked Gun, based on the epic failed TV series, came out in 1988, when
Reagan was still President.

I'm gonna be in Denver right before BM opens until the 27th, what are the
odds of being able to hit the Playa for the last couple of days w/out having
to pay full freight?

Actually, a totally different play.  I'd say primary gag here is the 
play on words utilizing the term "King Size."

Use NRR in the header for totally un-rave/club/osby related posts please.

What malware?  You might still be able to use it, very few windows

ROFL, you've got maybe 5 gigs of work, and 45 gigs of porn, warez and

If your hard drive is partitioned into multiple partitions or you 
currently have multiple hard disks somewhere, it's easy.  If it's not, 
you'll need an external drive for a few, or take your chances with 
something like http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php (it's like a 
linux live distro that has tools for changing partition sizes *hopefully* 
without nuking their contents) or partition magic (insert distant laughter 
here) and create a new partition on the drive without removing the 
existing data.  None of this is foolproof, even if the operator isn't a 
fool so be careful:

With GParted you'd shrink your current windows partition by 50+ gb, then 
create a new partition, format it, then copy your files there, and then 
install your new os to your old (original) partition.

But the external disk is the best answer.

-&e->Let me pre-empt the 'get a mac' acolytes by stating that I plan to 
-&e->get one in the near future and that I'd go the pure linux route if it 
-&e->weren't for the extra 15 steps I gotta take everytime I plug a new 
-&e->piece of HW into this box, m'kay?

No operating system is perfect, and even when the os is perfect, things 
can go wrong.

-&e->Also, I'm not too keen on burning x amount of gigs onto DVDs, in this, or
-&e->any other, lifetime.

If this data you claim is so important, is really so important, then treat 
it like it's important.  You have any idea how annoying it is when people 
ask someone who is technically knowledgable to make up for thier laziness 
or lack of foresight?  We're nerds, not magicians.

Go buy an external hard drive, plug it in, get it working, copy your shit 
over, install whatever it is you're going to install, and for the rest of 
your life KEEP YOUR IMPORTANT SHIT IN AT LEAST TWO PLACES and try to run 
your computer more like a server/tool and less like an amusement park 
(malware/virus crap is totally attributed to avoidable user behaviors in 
probably 99% of all cases).

You're lucky you had a "malware" rather than a disk crash.

yeah, if something is really important it should exist in at least 2
physical locations so a single hardware failure can't destroy it, and it's
even better if you store it on 2 drives and a cd/dvd.  honestly what's so
bad about letting a bunch of DVD's burn while you do something else?

well, correct me if I'm wrong, but that whole distributed node' concept was
originally set up to keep Command & Control communications functioning, in
case of a nuclear attack on CONUS, was what was the whole damned point of
setting up the internets in the first place, wasn't it?

Or did I not hear that one right?

Even if I did hear it right, it's obvious it didn't sink in on a personal
level or I wouldna wasted everybody's time like this.

God, I suck.

It was Vundu and all the fixes I tried ended up w/nada. V/ult was rock solid
in safe mode and I wouldna bothered if the default wasn't to cut my sound
card out of the picture. I just started doing vid and it was kinda pointless
without audio.

3 years, shit even a year ago you'da had me dead to rights on all of that,
but honest, outsourced, Injun, thanks to youporn/redtube there's no longer
any need for me to store any of that locally anymore.

I went back and had another look at the folder where all my shit is and it's
not 50 gigs but 165 gigs.

Oops.

Let me qualify that by saying I'm real new to doing pics/vid and about 95%
of that crap is just that, crap, but it's part of my "learning cliff' and I
want to hang onto it until I feel i'm ready to go to the next level.

A "short between the headphones" is an operational issue that I'm painfully

Two words: tight budget.

But yeah, you're right, I did put all my eggs in one basket, thanks for your
time and patience.

.
You have no idea how embarrased I am by this, I'm in my 4th, going on my 5th
decade, next year, of being around 'puters, (i can still hear the screech of
the 'Asteroids' program being played in a straight music cassette player
over the speakers instead of being properly jacked into a Trash-80)  and
I've been way, way more careful around computers then I have ever been with
women, despite the fact that you can't get a box preggers.

At least not yet.

Go figure, because right now, I can't.

Thanks again for taking your time out for me like this, I'm humbled.

I'm currently taking a marketing research class at UC Berkeley extension,
and we have our final presentation coming up next week.  Ironically enough,
the project is based around MARKETING RESEARCH.  We're conducting indepth
interviews along with a survey.  If anyone has 10 extra minutes in their
day, and wants to help us out, myself and my group would GREATLY appreciate
the effort!  I promise this is the first and last time I'll spam the list
with my schoolwork!

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=WKhmfQcNxvddaGp12EwT4g_3d_3d

PS   We're closing the survey out on Saturday night.
