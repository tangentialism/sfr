Damn, if that isn't the truth! I can't stand to be in a club scene anymore
either, for the most part. I kinda go there every once in a while just to
remind myself why I now do what I do. It really, really, really makes you
appreciate our wonderful world of underground parties.

Uh oh.  First of all, FMRs were never held "every month of yore" at
Candlestick Park.  In fact, I can't recall for sure but I don't believe
even one was ever held there.  The first and last Candlestick gathering
I went to -- and it was a doozy -- was Xochipili which got moved from
Greyhound Rock down Highway 1 after we dragged all the sound stuff down
to the beach and the cops showed up and made us drag it all back up
again.  Then we went to Candlestick, Moonpup and the *old* Dub Tribe
with about seven musicians played, among others, the sprinklers came on
in the middle of our "dance floor" in the grass, we had a glorious
sunrise over the Bay.  That was June 1993.  

Occasional events were held there afterward, and at one there was a 
series of altercations with some tough guys who showed up, and a couple
people were hurt.  And no "ranger got shot," it's a city park.  

Just wanted to set the record right . . .

Dear Anarch,

No offense is intended by the following, it is for mouth-corner-raising 
purposes only... I just couldn't resist!  I have taken the liberty of 
using all the words in "for me/in my opinion" out of context and 
including pluralizing, where they seemed to "do the most good."  :)
[The words in brackets are meant to be ignored in this reading.]

I was going to post it to the list, but thought I'd run it by you first 
out of courtesy since I am indulging my bizarre sense of humor here 
basically at your expense!  If you find it funny, go ahead and forward it 
to the list, otherwise feel free to trash it if that's what it deserves.  
I had fun writing it, that's the important part.  

Luv & laughs,

				<<< Starchild >>>

	I hung out with a whole posse of the lil' buggers tonite...they 
ate a bunch of my sunchips.  They are really beautiful, and it was really
cute the way they held their chips and made a really generic crunching noise
as they ate.  Then I realized I wasn't helping them much by giving them
sunchips, so I stopped, bid them farewell, and left.  I LOVE NATURE!  I GIVE

hello all-  allow me to rant and rave for a moment.  NO MORE "BACK IN MY
DAY"!!!!  it drives me crazy to continually have "what the scene was"
contrasted to "what the scene is".  we are here, and we are now, and each
time we have that discussion about older scenes, we cement ourselves within
a mindset that is incapable of being here.

something i learned from shawna at chrysalis: now is the perfect moment,
here is the perfect place.  any and all attempts to go to another time and
place are 1) futile and 2) unhealthy.  that's my .02 for the day, but a .02
that i'm rather concerned about.

peace, love, and now-

Futile, perhaps. But unhealthy? Never. It always helps to look at where 
you have been in order to help see where you are going.

There is a web page, as someone noted, but at present there's no info there
about shows or tours.  That page has only been around a short while, and
the "upcoming performances" section has never been filled in at all.  They
used to play around the bay pretty frequently, every 3-4 months or so, but
the last local show I know of was this past May.  That was part of a tour
that finished midsummer, so hopefully they'll be back playing soon.  They
can be tough to keep track of...their shows go on with varying degrees of
underground-ness, so the level of advertising, promotion, etc can vary a
lot as well.  Assuming the web page gets updated regularly, it should be a
good source of info--it's run by their publisher, Charnel Music.  Asking on
rec.music.industrial can also get answers.

Hard house or high NRG til around midnight then the hardest mind bending 
trance (be it acid, psychedelic, goa or whatever, it's all good!) til 
about 4:30.  Then slowing it down a bit to some groovier tunes, then late 
morning more happy house - the reach out and love your brothers n' 
sisters type of stuff.  Then I like to go home and chill to ambient til I 
go to sleep.  That would be my perfect sequence to going off.

love to all,
Amy

Regarding Full Moons there.  The Full Moon in June '93 at the Water 
Temple was moved to Candlestick after it got busted.  Just a historic 
note.  =)

I've been being forgetful as of late, but I don't think they are corny at 
all.  They are rather cool looking!  I don't care if some people think it 
is corny - with some of the get-ups I've seen people in, I think 
laminates are rather tame.  So all of you out there with them -you really 
should wear them!  Just cause you know alot of sfravers already doesn't 
mean there are other newer people who want to meet you!  I'll still wear 
mine even if I'm the only sfraver left who does wear one because I always 
want to meet new people on sfraves.

Acutally, I remember the June 3rd/4th FMR of 93 (It was my 21st b-day!), which 
was held at the Water Temple.....fantastic as usual, and then 30+ cops in riot 
gear showed up and everyone kept dancing, including some making 30 foot shadow 
dancers in the headlights of the cop cars, until they finally sent everyone 
home....so it was moved to Candlestick. I didn't make it, instead opting for 
the free breakfast at Denny's and a CS final.

Uh oh.  First of all, FMRs were never held "every month of yore" at
Candlestick Park.  In fact, I can't recall for sure but I don't believe
even one was ever held there.  The first and last Candlestick gathering
I went to -- and it was a doozy -- was Xochipili which got moved from
Greyhound Rock down Highway 1 after we dragged all the sound stuff down
to the beach and the cops showed up and made us drag it all back up
again.  Then we went to Candlestick, Moonpup and the *old* Dub Tribe
with about seven musicians played, among others, the sprinklers came on
in the middle of our "dance floor" in the grass, we had a glorious
sunrise over the Bay.  That was June 1993.  

Occasional events were held there afterward, and at one there was a 
series of altercations with some tough guys who showed up, and a couple
people were hurt.  And no "ranger got shot," it's a city park.  

Just wanted to set the record right . . .

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Regarding raves, #, & sex; for (ME) raves are very erotic. To say we
are all of sudden not sexual beings at an event like a rave is poppy cock(no
pun intended).  Humans as a species, are definately sexual beings; ask any
man who's around 17 - 21 years of age, or any womyn who's 33 - 38 years of
age. We as species are suppose to, and have very little control over LIFE's
energy/force. When I speak of LIFE's energy/force, I'm speaking about that
spark, or that essences/feeling that pushes us to join with another being(no
implied gay negatives) allowing the species to hopefully continue. That LIFE
energy/force which, for awhile defies chaos.

        Sure we decide not to be sexual/erotic, but this requires a decision
at some level, for the feelings are there. We just CHOSE not to act on them.
I as a professional male licensed massage therapist performing massage on
someone I'm attracted to, requires this decision a lot. Sure I feel that
sexual energy when I working on someone I find attractive, I'm a man, and at
the present state of evolution of the male of the human species, I find that
I'm hopelessly wired that way. For massage is healing, but it's also very
erotic at most levels for the giver & the receiver. But it would be
wrong/unethical for me to engage in sexual relations with a client. For the
very simple reason that when someone comes to me for a massage, there coming
to so I can facilitate THEIR bodies natural healing ability, not so I can
excersise MY sexual agenda. I become the taker then, when I'm suppose to be
the giver. For me it's no different than a doctor doing it do his patients.

        I also understand when some people partake in every ravers favorite
pastime, that they can go either way sexually. Some men can't come, and some
womyn just don't enjoy it, or want to be touched that way. While other men
like myself become the energizer bunny, and other womyn are just plain
unsatisfiable, purrrrrrrrrrr. I understand sex on #, isn't real, it's just
not that intense most of the time. But the experience sure is fun!!!! = >, +
>. I would highly recommend it for older married folks so that it scould
help them rekindle their sex life, and possibly even their marriage.

        It helped me recently end my fear of sex & sexual relations steming
from years of sexual trauma experienced as a child. Finally freeing my
sexual being trapped for almost 33 years.

        So that's my 2 cents anyway, but I would be interested in hearing
back from people with regard to whether they enjoy sex more when on, or when
not, or if they like both equally as much. I want this info for PURELY
private satistical data, for my sense is that more people either can't do
it, or don't like it, than can & do.

i guess it all depends what club you are talking about..  at meatmarket
type clubs you definitely do stand out as a guy dancing by yourself.
but if you go to a place like 1015 Folsom (main floor or basement),
Sound Factory, DV8 (to some degree) people are more into dancing than
anything else and generally pay you no mind.  i do agree though,
a proper "rave" is definitely the best atmosphere.

Just to add my 2 cents to this topic: 
Today i saw a wonderful sign: decouvrez la vitalite d'ici
It translates as: Discover the vitality of/from here

In a city (Montreal) that is slowly sinking into an economic depression (if
it hasn't already completely), this is a very interesting sign to have
displayed.

Now you are wondering what in the world this has to do with sfraves right?
Well, it's just a lovely thing to think about that we don't necessarily do:
Discover (not just enjoy) the Vitality of the here and now.  I'm not dissing
anything that happened in the past, whether it be in or out of the rave
scene.  I'm just saying that there is a wealth of stuff to discover in the
present moment.  A wealth that is usually only scratched at by the majority,
imho.

Equally amazing is discovering that something new-found is merely 
something "old" rediscovered.

OK, you're right, I used the wrong word... well actually I don't think I
used the wrong word, but we seem to have differing opinions about the
nature of anarchy. When I think of "anarchy," I don't think about a
situation which merely doesn't have government or forced coersion, I think
of disorder. And I hapen to believe that disorder is not a *good* (whatta
subjective term!) goal to strive for.

You seem to equate anarchy with, say, the situation of native americans
before European intervention, and in that case anarchy is a good thing.
Local self rule without coersion from a distance is the ideal form of
government (yes, I think it is a form of government and I don't believe
that government is by nature bad), but unforunately it's been tried (In
spain after WW2... Barcelona I believe had a small anarchistic government
for a while, but don't quote me on this or anything :) and while the
results were good for a while, the small communities just didn't have the
necessary clout to hold their own... In other words the only way to
maintain an effective and long-lasting anarchistic government is if the
entire world decides upon it simutaneously and completely... and that just
won't happen because of the way we're used to living.

Oppresive governments developed mainly in agricultural societies like the
Middle East etc... the only effective anarchistic governments that I know
of in history were used by nomads who followed their food around (i.e.
Inuits, native americans, etc.).

I think that's why I'm wary of people who think that you can be peaceful
and anarchistic _and_ vegetarian at the same, becase it seems that large
oppresive totalitarian states developed almost concurrently with farming
and the large-scale agriculture that's necessary to feed a big population.
Nomads did not have the same problems, because they had no deeply-ingrained
concept of personal property that needed to be defended (because their home
kept moving around, so they could only keep whatever they were carrying at
the time).

Whoa... I'm off on another tangent... back to the response...

I do dig, but I'll give another example to show that survival in this
modern world necesitates a strong government: East Timor. A small island
country, that, after it was granted autonomy by Portugal (in the 70's),
decided it was going to have a representative socialist government. Well,
they got together all twelve ethnic groups on the island, and set up one of
the most effectively democratic governments in the world at the time. It
lasted four days... neighboring Indonesia (whose government was based on
oppression of its minorities) saw this little socialist country as a
"threat" and with the help of the US (I think george Bush helped draw up
the invasion plans) they invaded and threw the country it into a chaos that
still exists today.

East Timor did its damndest to live in a civilized and "fair" way, and they
did a good job of it, but you can't be isolated in a world as
interconnected as ours. So, I think unfortunately government is necessary
mainly due to overcrowding and competition for limited resources. I wish it
wasn't but it just is.

(I had a _really good_ high school history teacher... thanks mr. McCrystle!)

True enough... I'm nice for selfish reasons too, but I still think that
being chritable and good is a denial of our animal instincts to conquer and
dominate.

That's OK I like talking...

How about SFRaves jumpsuits?

they could be olive drab (to set us off from other, more "colorful" ravers
and to provide for easy recognition) and big n'roomy to provide proper
ventilation.

Perhaps they'd be made of some kind of mesh material to facilitae airflow,
and a giant "SFRAVES" embroidered on the front, back, and each arm and leg,
so no one confuses an SFRaves jumpsuit with anyone else's... i.e.
AlbanyRaves, ElCerritoRaves, TracyRaves, LodiRaves or StocktonRaves.
-Although I think ElCerrotoRaves adopted the forehead tattoo plan, which
allows for easy identification even in non-rave situation. Also, now that I
think of it, LodiRaves and StocktonRaves have both changed their jumpsuit
colors to Navy Blue and Grey respectively, because they were having some
problems with unsolicited hugs from other municipalities due to similar
jumpsuit color.

p.s. I want my laminate!!! And I want it soon... Wayne, you're the one who
makes laminates right? Will YOU be at mad on monday?

Hi everybody, just wondering if there was room for one more post
on today's government/anarchy discussion.  The following should have all 
of its sentences prefaced by "In my humble little possibly wrong 
opinion", but for the sake of length, it does not.  Okay:

	I've been sifting through the day's posts, many of which 
seem have a strongly pessimistic position in regards to the
general direction towards which human society is heading. 
Someone proposed anarchy as a possible "solution," which
I found insulting.  Is the suggestion here that humans should run
away from the complexities of government, throw our hands in
the air, and give up?  Remove all laws?  Government is often
viewed by Americans as interfering, disruptive, and an 
annoyance.  
	I would suggest the precise opposite: government is one of 
the most natural things on the planet.  So are laws and rules.  Human 
beings are the most social species on the planet: we have language, 
highly evolved emotions, and an overriding desire for human contact (for 
instance, the existence of sfraves).  The only mammal that will die 
during the second stage of infancy without assistance from the rest of 
its species is the human baby: the lesson there is a huge one--people 
truly need each other.  And if we need each other, that means that 
countless interactions between people will occur. If interactions occur 
between different people with different opinions, then there's going to 
be a need for a certain amount of lubrication to make sure that these 
meetings run smoothly.  
	Rules will appear (for example, I put 'NON-RAVE' 
on this post, so that someone who is bored by this kind of debate won't 
waste time reading this) as humans try and make their lives run more 
smoothly, and rather than vote on every single possible issue, which 
would consume a tremendous amount of every citizen's time, the ancient 
Greeks came up with the idea of representation, where we elect others
to wrestle with the fine print and technicalities.  This is the system of 
government we have today. If you hate the job that Bill CLinton is doing, 
fine. You can vote for someone else.  Upset that there isn't another 
satisfactory choice, and it seems like you're being forced to choose 
between  the same-old Republican/Democrat system, then vote for an 
obscure third-party to make a statement.  Or write in your own name, or 
anything, but vote, even if only for the right to disagree with whoever 
ends up winning any election.  If you don't vote, then how will you ever be 
able to justify expressing a dissenting opinion?  Someone could say, 
well, didja vote?  And if you didn't, then there won't be any moral 
ground to stand upon. The word 'idiot' comes from the Greek word meaning
'non-voter'.  
	Government is far from perfect, needs a lot of work, and could 
certainly use a bunch of fresh faces.  But we live in a society where the 
majority rules, and, strangely, the voice of the people becomes clearest 
when all voices cry out together: the results of an election are most 
indicative of a society's wishes when everybody votes.  And for the sake 
of preventing descent into anarchy, the people must accept the fact that 
other voices have to be heard, and must accept the voice of the majority 
and allow it to become law, with the knowledge from all sides that this 
law can be changed in the future if need be.  Ultimately, then, judgment has 
to be suspended, and what better place is there to learn how to lay down 
one's judgment than at a rave?  


see you all out there,
Timothy

Word!!  While it is necessary to reflect and re-evaluate once every so 
often, the tired complaint of how it was is not what it is, is simply 
weak.  Unless that energy is used to create a similar feeling, bitching 
only makes things worse.  So people get real, do whatcha like, and be 
here now....Its all about love, kids!

My apologies, I know certain topics are considered semi-taboo on this forum, 
but I have a friend that's doing research for a paper on controlled 
psychoactive drugs for one of her nursing courses.  I mentioned to her that 
I had seen, somewhere, a web page with pictures of different forms of MDMA 
(e) with street names and descriptions of dosages.  Now that I've opened my 
mouth, I can't seem to find that page.  It was something I'd happened across 
a couple of months ago.  If anyone knows the web address for this page, 
please let me know.

Again, this is for research purposes only, and I apologize for opening up 
this non-rave topic, but I'm in a bit of a bind.

Thanks in advance,

S

There were official Anarchist parties during the Spanish civil war, which
started in the 20's and ended in '39 I think. The only parties I know
of were in Catalonia, of which Barcelona is one province. If you are
interested in knowing what it is like to fight for an
Anarchist/Socialist/Communist/Anything-but-facism party, check out
Homage to Catalonia by George Orwell. It's what Animal Farm is based on.

Yep, I have another question about equipment. I'm all new to this (I've
been buying the CDs and going to the raves for years) DJing. And I plan
to start DJing. But what am I best off buying, a pair of 1200s or dual
CD-players? I have a LOT of CDs that I'd like to be able to incorporate
in my new hobby. Also, should I decide that this was nothing for me,
I still have a good set of CD-players. How do you see the future of
vinyl vs. CD? What is the best choice for a newbie like me?

Just to correct some misinformation, yes we did throw a whole bunch of
FMRs at Candlestick, beginning way back in '91. In fact we got quite
settled until a nasty incident forced us to go elsewhere. Three people
ended up in hospital, a partygoer who was beaten unconcious with the
butt of an Uzzi, and a park gardener and a jogger were both shot and
wounded.
Now, because the trouble was caused by some drunken locals who stumbled
across our celebration accidentally and not any FMRavers, we thought 
that that would be the end of the matter. Unfortunately though the
local authorities were pretty upset and after playing cat and mouse
with us for a few months let us know that if we didn't stop we'd be run
out of town. Thankfully we didn't stop we just headed out of the city,
but I must add that the forces of "law and order" gave us a whole lot
more grief than the original incident ever did.

I hope this helps jog a few memories.

Most definitively not too bad. I'm looking at a Gemini CD-9500 dual CDplayer,
a MTX750 mixer, a 160 watt amp, a pair of 12" Soundtech's B2s and a Technics
dual tape deck. That would set me back something like $2700 incl tax+s&h.
Anyone know where I can get a better deal, or just have any comments on my
choice of equipment?

>
>(soon-to-be) DJ Eskimo
>
Well DJ Eskimo,>
my experience is that housemusic sound much better from vinyl 
than from cd. Everyone can hear that for themselves by comparing
the same track heard from cd and vinyl. You will learn that 
vinyl has a much deeper sound. Why? I dunno. I guess it partly 
comes down to the fact that a cd is nothing but a long 44.1 khz
sample from the real sound. Releases from the Britisch label 
Irdial had a sheet of paper in it for a while (1992-1993) where 
this whole analog thing is explained. I reccomend you find one, 
'coz it's really fun to read. . 
And then there is the whole mixing thing. I've never had much 
fun mixing with cd's. I prefer contact with the soundcarrier to 
pushing buttons. Also with records you can tell by looking at 
them when there's a break coming on. I even know people that 
claim to be able to draw out the complete arrangement of a track 
by carefully examining the grooves (?) on the record. 

Hope you'll choose vinyl!!!

sometimes without realizing I imagine what it would be like
if there were no labels dividing us so unions were natural
attractions between a couple.  I find the vibe erotic, but
the experience is what is inside us, of our own creation.

That's a really interesting point. I have never thought about this
problem from that angle. But I think I will try to find this sheet
(anyone have a copy?). =)

WHOA! That's kinda neat. But I'm a newbie to this entire mixing
business, and I need something that won't scare me away by being
too hard. =)

Ding, Idea. (lightbulb over head)
Although I fully agree with the no more" back in my day comments", I love
hearing about everyone's stories about fm's and raves of earlier days, or
even of yesterday.  All those "time standin still" moments that make us all
know exactly why we're here. (i.e.: my "dancing high atop a bassbin at bonny
dunes, sunrise behind me, moonset in front, head to the stars" story, (fmr
3yr ann)).    Anyway, has anyone put together any sort of collection of these
stories, some sort of local raves history book?  What do we think about this?
 Personally I think history is very important, and can't see anything but
good to come out of it, it's our "never enough, grass is always greener" type
personalities that we need to curtail when telling the stories.  Let me know
what ya'll think.
Love & Life,
Steveo
P.S. I'm afraid I wouldn't have the time dedication to compile such a thing,
but would be able to help making it into hardcopy, and definitely could
contribute to it.

Hardcopy?  Why?  Why not just submit it to Hyperreal and let them keep it 
online?  Paperless society and all that...

Hey there!
I've been on the list for a short time and due to my tangential nature,
it's fitting that the first thing I'd post would not DIRECTLY relate to
raves.  The message I'm forwarding to you all does, however, have
everything to do with being able to talk about rave culture including the
drugs associated with it, without fear.  The Religious Right's "Computer
Decency Act "would endanger the free flowing exchange of ideas that take
place on lists like hyperreal's.  Read the message below and forward it to
your friends.
Protect your rights to free speech and freedom of association!

Because talking about it is half the fun,
Maria

You'll find a few local FMR along with other classic rave stories from
around the world at http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/spirit/testimonials/

And then there's always the sfraves archives which contain everything
ever posted to this list at http:/www.hyperreal.com/raves/sf/archives/

Hello ppl.

I recently got sucked into an ego battle on sfraves. We began debating
about a certain issue, and all that mattered after awhile was 'who would
come out on top' in the end. A little white back, I almost got sucked into
another one, but cut it off as soon as I recognized what was happening. As
someone who has made self-improvement a daily practice, it is difficult for
me to find excuses or to rationalize behaving on such a low level of
consciousness as the instigation of, or the participation of conquest over
another for the gratification of ego.

And I think that the saddest thing about this is that the people who do it
the most are the ones who are the most unaware that they are doing it.

They are the ones, who, right now are trying to find 1,000,0001 ways to
tear this post apart, piece by piece and put me in my place. It is because
this is what they do. They do it often, and they do it well. It is in their
personality makeup. They will find any word left out, any phallacy in logic
or loophole at which they can pick apart. Going off on tangents and not
sticking to the subjects at hand is another good one. Put simply, they are
the ones who DO NOT debate about the subject matter, but go right after the
jugular of their opponent's ego.

And so, as one who can only take responsibility for his own behavior. I
make a formal apology, and will endeavor to function on a higher level of
consciousness in the future.

IMHO: 
I think you are conveniently overlooking the fact that we do not live in a 
truly democratic society, but in a gross deformation of such, where votes, 
representatives, the media, even the very ideas we are coerced to believe are 
bought and sold on the marketplace of the elite.  The majority does not rule, 
the agendas of a small minority rule this country.  Just look at the 
mega-conglomerate corporations that control the media right now.  A handful of 
people have the power to control the collective unconscious of the "majority" 
of this country any way they please.....and yes, I think all of this does 
apply to raves as they are equally tied into this sick, social organism.  
Consider how they have been made out to by our media minority to be a *danger* 
to society, requiring extensive permits, policing, etc. This has forced raves 
to yield to economic pressures and control and come above ground.......... 
 
have a good weekend all.......

Hi everybody, just wondering if there was room for one more post
on today's government/anarchy discussion.  The following should have all 
of its sentences prefaced by "In my humble little possibly wrong 
opinion", but for the sake of length, it does not.  Okay:

	I've been sifting through the day's posts, many of which 
seem have a strongly pessimistic position in regards to the
general direction towards which human society is heading. 
Someone proposed anarchy as a possible "solution," which
I found insulting.  Is the suggestion here that humans should run
away from the complexities of government, throw our hands in
the air, and give up?  Remove all laws?  Government is often
viewed by Americans as interfering, disruptive, and an 
annoyance.  
	I would suggest the precise opposite: government is one of 
the most natural things on the planet.  So are laws and rules.  Human 
beings are the most social species on the planet: we have language, 
highly evolved emotions, and an overriding desire for human contact (for 
instance, the existence of sfraves).  The only mammal that will die 
during the second stage of infancy without assistance from the rest of 
its species is the human baby: the lesson there is a huge one--people 
truly need each other.  And if we need each other, that means that 
countless interactions between people will occur. If interactions occur 
between different people with different opinions, then there's going to 
be a need for a certain amount of lubrication to make sure that these 
meetings run smoothly.  
	Rules will appear (for example, I put 'NON-RAVE' 
on this post, so that someone who is bored by this kind of debate won't 
waste time reading this) as humans try and make their lives run more 
smoothly, and rather than vote on every single possible issue, which 
would consume a tremendous amount of every citizen's time, the ancient 
Greeks came up with the idea of representation, where we elect others
to wrestle with the fine print and technicalities.  This is the system of 
government we have today. If you hate the job that Bill CLinton is doing, 
fine. You can vote for someone else.  Upset that there isn't another 
satisfactory choice, and it seems like you're being forced to choose 
between  the same-old Republican/Democrat system, then vote for an 
obscure third-party to make a statement.  Or write in your own name, or 
anything, but vote, even if only for the right to disagree with whoever 
ends up winning any election.  If you don't vote, then how will you ever be 
able to justify expressing a dissenting opinion?  Someone could say, 
well, didja vote?  And if you didn't, then there won't be any moral 
ground to stand upon. The word 'idiot' comes from the Greek word meaning
'non-voter'.  
	Government is far from perfect, needs a lot of work, and could 
certainly use a bunch of fresh faces.  But we live in a society where the 
majority rules, and, strangely, the voice of the people becomes clearest 
when all voices cry out together: the results of an election are most 
indicative of a society's wishes when everybody votes.  And for the sake 
of preventing descent into anarchy, the people must accept the fact that 
other voices have to be heard, and must accept the voice of the majority 
and allow it to become law, with the knowledge from all sides that this 
law can be changed in the future if need be.  Ultimately, then, judgment has 
to be suspended, and what better place is there to learn how to lay down 
one's judgment than at a rave?  


see you all out there,
Timothy

Hmm... If you're willing to spend around $2700, I would recommend checking
out the Pioneer CDJ500-II CD players and the matching DJM500 mixer.  The
CDJ was modeled after the 1200's and has a large jog dial for queuing and
manipulating the disk manually.  It lies flat on a table just like a
reqular turntable.  It also has looping functions, master tempo controls
for easy beat-matching and (when used with the mixer and another CDJ500-II)
synchronized cross-faders that will start and stop the CD's depending on
the cross-fader position.  The DJM500 mixer was made to accompany the CDJ's
and has 4 seperate channel controls and 5 or 6 built in digital effects
(flange, reverb, delay, etc.) assignable to any of the four channels and
sampling capabilities.

I've been looking at them recently as I would like to learn how to  mix
music.  All of my music is on CD.  I've not really looked at other
alternatives but, it seemed like the closest interface analagous to mixing
on 1200's that I've seen.

Please let me know what you end up with.  I'd be interested in hearing from
other folks who are using CD players to mix music with.

Peace y'all

Tigger

        Jonas-  I definately agree with bart on the vinyl thing. If you
intend to only mix ambient, then CD's are good. A lot of ambient only comes
out on CD's. But if you ever intend to mix dance music, then vinyl is
crucial. I can't say that I've actually ever tried with CD's, but would
imagine it nigh impossible. If you shop around long enough & check the
classifieds, you should be able to pick up a pair of  1200's for $600
good luck.

I have to be conscious of this all the time in dealing with people 
everywhere, not just on the internet.  What I have to remember is that it 
is not who is right or who comes out on top that is important (ego as you 
said) but what you feel is your highest truth and what feels right for 
you.  So much energy is wasted in debate and proving points of view that 
are never going to be changed no matter what!  If you know what matters 
to you, live by that, and that proves the point better than any words 
could ever do!  Live by your own example.  

This is why I stay away from the battle over "PLUR" that pops its head 
every so often on this forum. I don't care about all the arguements.  I 
just know how I live my life and try the best I can to incorporate Peace 
Love Unity and Respect.  No debate can change my behavoir.  I act how I'm 
going to act - I walk the talk, so debates simply do not exist for me, 
therefore I have more energy to PRACTICE what I preach.  So I totally 
agree with what Sean's post - every bit of it! :)

love to all,
Amy

First of all, I'd like to state that this IS opinion. No one person could
possibly carry all the [correct] answers to life in his own mind. And as
for the intense amount of information available, I've barely absorbed even
the most miniscule fraction....

I carry the belief, that whatever happens is what is suppose to happen, and
that the universe is unfolding as it should. (At least I aspire to live my
life based upon that belief). I'd like to applaud Timothy McIntyre for
preaching acceptance of society in its present state of of evolution, and
here is why:

________________________________________________________________________________
People have been aware of [the] UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF REALITY and its
affect on consciousness (and personality) for centuries. According to
theory, there are seven levels of consciousness.

Levels 1-3 deal with the most basic (earthly) gratifications of stemming
from imbalances in the personality (i.e. id, ego, superego). Most (all) of
the motivations from these individuals come from fear-based programming.
Disheartening as it is may seem, the majority of the population constantly
moves between these three levels of of consciousness.

It is these individuals whose pictures, ideals, and concepts of reality do
not match actual reality. In other words, this person is strongly attached
to the picture of the world programmed in his own mind. More often than
not, the real world will not match that programmed world.

The stronger the person's motivation to impose his own programmed ideal of
what the world "should" or "shouldn't" be like on the real world is
proportional to the strength of the person's attachment to his programmed
(illusionary) picture. Stated thusly, an attachment to an ideal whose
strength is such that it is a([n] illusionary) need, and is not congruent
with reality, is an addiction.

Let's take a look at a simple example. Let's say you're driving home from
work and you suddenly run into what seems to be miles and miles of bumper
to bumper traffic. Instead of calmly (and joyfully) accepting what is going
on around you, you begin to feel a state change - a sense of irritation,
and perhaps even anger.

Why is this happening? It is because the picture (ideal) inside of your
head does not match what is actually going on around you. So strong is the
attachment (desire) of wanting to get home and the picture (ideal) of not
wanting to be stuck in *that darned* traffic, that an undesireable state
change sets in. Thus, the expression of the non-acceptance of the reality
surrounding you.

It is easy to see, that the more addictions a person may possess, the less
sense of peace, love, and tranquility felt within.

The sampling rate of CDs has nothing to do with the bass response.  It
will kill highs over 22K (the Nyquist frequency) but given the heavy 
(5g!) stylus pressures used in DJing so the rekkids don't skip, vinyl
will never have anything over 10K anyway unelss it's virgin.  Plus no
one who goes to raves will have enough hearing left to tell. >%^/

The boominess of vinyl bass has to do with the turntables physically
feeding back with the huge speaker stacks.  Hit a turntable while it's
playing a record and you can hear your hand whacking it, right?  Well,
some with the low bass, which is loud enough to cause resonance with
the DJ equipment.  CDs are not subject to this as the information is
digital and unaffected by vibration until it causes the CD to skip.

Likely you could simulate this with some resonant EQ on the subsonics,
if you like that boomy stuff.  I personally don't.  The Oasis in San
Jose used to be really terrible for that -- all the basslines sounded
the same no matter what was playing.

I posted something about this within the last month, but got no comment.  
I'd also be really interested in hearing "history" about raves in 
the bay area.  It's interesting to know how the scene has changed, 
remained the same, etc.  So, I second Steve's opinion!!

Subject: Re: Chakra Definition, OBE & Music Manipulation
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Sorry for not defining the term "chakra" in my last post.  I've been on 
such a roll w/people on the same wavelength as me that I didn't think about 
explaining it.  In fact, I integrate so much info from different places 
that I had to look it up to give you a more reliable answer.

Chakras (meaning wheel or vortex) defined in a really good book (Color & 
Crystals by Joy Gardner) defines it as the center of spinning energy.  This 
energy can be received, transmitted, as well as  related to social, sexual, 
and spiritual energy.  There are seven chakra points on the body and each 
one has color(s), emotion(s), crystal(s), tones and chants associated with 
them.  I don't know the history of origin but it can be traced back to yoga 
practices and to me, it seems to have a more Eastern philosophy associated 
with it.

So when I referred to the lower chakras in my previous post, I was 
referring to the sexual, ego, physical realm desires that drive us.  These 
chakras are located at your tailbone, and a little below the navel (to the 
left) as well as at your solar plexus.  The other chakras include the 
heart, throat, third eye (between your eyebrows) and your crown 
(divination).  These last four are more on the spiritual bend.

There's lots of vague crossovers in Western society (AA's head, heart and 
guts comes to mind) but info related to chakra healing and power is usually 
sought out here rather than common everyday Western knowledge.  I can go on lots
more, but I don't think it's applicable.

W/r/t Music manipulation, I do just want to say that there are specific tones 
and ranges that are associated with each chakra and they can vibrate specific 
parts of your body opening you up (hence my working through my chakras when 
dancing).  Have you seen a crowd going off and when the dj plays the warm 
strings, high pitched sound and they raise their hands?  To me, instincts are 
woken up deep within us and when we raise our hands, we're channeling divine 
light into us which is ineviteably to all of us and Mother Earth since were all 
connected.  Again, just my opinion, and yeah, I know people raise their hands 
all the time to other tones/frequencies, but it seems accentuated when I hear 
warm strings.

Your description below of what happens w/your energy w/tribal bass leads me to 
believe that you indeed feel a connection but didn't have the same terms to 
describe it as me...irregardless, it's all good! :)

And w/r/t OBE, nah, you don't always have to indulge or imbibe to get out of 
your body but it's nice to sometimes ;)  There's pathways each of us can tap 
into naturally to connect and transform...again, it's not common knowledge but 
training can be sought out.  For me, just listening and dancing to music can 
transport me especially when dancing in the dirt barefoot outside.  And yes, 
like you, I feel spirits and archetypical energies invoked some of these times.

A friend of mine described his experimentation w/dancing and imbibing as 
follows:  it's an elevator up to enlightenment and higher consciousness but you 
always come back down.  The real task is to build the stepping stones in 
everyday life to reach the same station(s).  I hope you like his description as 
much as I do.

Building steps and getting higher...

Love in white light,
Diane

Huh?

I gotta tell you, when I dance, I'm not OB, I don't feel any chakras (or any 
other terms not part of the general public's vocabulary).  On the other 
hand, I enjoy the hell out of dancing.  I'm a bit of a show-off, so there's 
that, but with the right music -- usually something with tons of really 
heavy, driving, ancient, tribal bass -- there's a feeling of power, of 
energy coursing through me.  In my mind, it's as though the other elements 
of the music are simply counterpoints to that booming; and then it's like 
something ancient, something that speaks to something eternal within.  I 
feel the blood of ancestors long dead come to life within me, and we are 
one, dancing infinite, moving to that beat, the puissant thrum beyond 
hearing of the earth's timeless magma heart...

Whoa...was I getting deep?...Sorry...  58-)

At the Martin Luther King Jr. Spundae, I could have danced all night to some 
of the things that got spun, and it was because of that energy.  But OBE?  
No, can't say that I have.  I don't suppose this requires or is aided by 
chemical assistance?

Wasting brain cells looking through the Chronicle at Macys ads and other 
trash, I came across an interesting blurb about E on page A9, accompanied by a 
cartoon of a happy chemist makin bacon..........:) 
 
ECSTASY CAN BE A PROBLEM 
	The Netherlands seems to be supplying much of Europe with Ecstasy, a 
happy pill that can be produced with a school chemistry kit.  When teenagers 
die from MDMA, patented in 1914 and originally used as an appetite suppressant 
for German troops, pressure grows on the Dutch government.  France and Germany 
have told the Netherlands that its lenient drug policies threaten the European 
ideal of open borders. 
	The Dutch argue that they treat Ecstasy as a "hard" drug but that the 
Netherlands happens to be one of the European Union's major distribution 
centers for all goods.  Is it a sin to have a good infrastructure?  The 
necessary chemicals, they say, come mainly from outside.  And they have 
statistics to show that their drug seizure totals compare favorably with those 
of their accusers.  
	Give the danger, especially to liver and kidneys, why would anyone 
take Ecstasy?  Users report feelings of euphoria, love, and energy, just right 
for an all night Rave.  Alix Sharkey, writing in the London Guardian, says 
teenagers recognize the "hype and hysteria" surrounding the drug and cannot be 
intimidated.  Sharkey quotes a physician saying a person is five times more 
likely to die on a ski holiday in Switzerland than from taking Ecstasy.  (The 
Guardian also provides a chart showing what the drug costs at various British 
locales--and where it's the real thing.  Cheaper "cousins" abound.) 
	Meanwhile, Dutch entrepreneurs keep making their product -- and huge 
profits.  One producer, says the London Times, was convicted in 1992 and 
sentenced to a year and a half in prison, which he hasn't served because a 
Dutch prison has never "invited" him.  Until it does, he can't go inside.  As 
his lawyer acknowledges, he's probably working.

But didn't you read what I wrote? My point was that if you don't like the
representatives which you "have been coerced to believe", then you can 
always vote for someone else!  Look at a ballot next time you 
vote--you'll find the green party, the peace and freedom party, and a 
host of other "alternative" (for lack of a better word) choices.  Or, as I
said before, you can write in candidates on the matter of principle.  Or 
you can vote for a pro-education candidate, who will increase funding for 
schools if s/he wins, which will maybe result in the education of future 
generations and, with more knowledge, they will be better equipped to 
realize that there's more out there than the Clintons or Doles...the 
possibilities are endless.  As for not living in a "truly democratic 
society", a democracy is defined by merely allowing every citizen one
precious vote.  The rest is left up to natural market forces, for better 
or worse.  Okay, enough babbling from me... I do agree with you however
that the media does have a lot of power, but there's still an internal 
check which provides Americans with more accurate news about their 
government than any other nation on earth: strangely, it's money.  If I 
get a big scoop and uncover some big government scandal, I can make a 
fortune by putting it on tv if I'm the nightly news, or if I'm a 
newspaper, I'm constantly searching for fresher news than other 
newspapers have.  I want the best scoop, so I work harder.  Money fuels 
the watchdog, and I don't think that's bad at all.  
sorry, babbling again :)

see ya

Hi everybody, just wondering if there was room for one more post
on today's government/anarchy discussion.  The following should have all 
of its sentences prefaced by "In my humble little possibly wrong 
opinion", but for the sake of length, it does not.  Okay:

	I've been sifting through the day's posts, many of which 
seem have a strongly pessimistic position in regards to the
general direction towards which human society is heading. 
Someone proposed anarchy as a possible "solution," which
I found insulting.  Is the suggestion here that humans should run
away from the complexities of government, throw our hands in
the air, and give up?  Remove all laws?  Government is often
viewed by Americans as interfering, disruptive, and an 
annoyance.  
	I would suggest the precise opposite: government is one of 
the most natural things on the planet.  So are laws and rules.  Human 
beings are the most social species on the planet: we have language, 
highly evolved emotions, and an overriding desire for human contact (for 
instance, the existence of sfraves).  The only mammal that will die 
during the second stage of infancy without assistance from the rest of 
its species is the human baby: the lesson there is a huge one--people 
truly need each other.  And if we need each other, that means that 
countless interactions between people will occur. If interactions occur 
between different people with different opinions, then there's going to 
be a need for a certain amount of lubrication to make sure that these 
meetings run smoothly.  
	Rules will appear (for example, I put 'NON-RAVE' 
on this post, so that someone who is bored by this kind of debate won't 
waste time reading this) as humans try and make their lives run more 
smoothly, and rather than vote on every single possible issue, which 
would consume a tremendous amount of every citizen's time, the ancient 
Greeks came up with the idea of representation, where we elect others
to wrestle with the fine print and technicalities.  This is the system of 
government we have today. If you hate the job that Bill CLinton is doing, 
fine. You can vote for someone else.  Upset that there isn't another 
satisfactory choice, and it seems like you're being forced to choose 
between  the same-old Republican/Democrat system, then vote for an 
obscure third-party to make a statement.  Or write in your own name, or 
anything, but vote, even if only for the right to disagree with whoever 
ends up winning any election.  If you don't vote, then how will you ever be 
able to justify expressing a dissenting opinion?  Someone could say, 
well, didja vote?  And if you didn't, then there won't be any moral 
ground to stand upon. The word 'idiot' comes from the Greek word meaning
'non-voter'.  
	Government is far from perfect, needs a lot of work, and could 
certainly use a bunch of fresh faces.  But we live in a society where the 
majority rules, and, strangely, the voice of the people becomes clearest 
when all voices cry out together: the results of an election are most 
indicative of a society's wishes when everybody votes.  And for the sake 
of preventing descent into anarchy, the people must accept the fact that 
other voices have to be heard, and must accept the voice of the majority 
and allow it to become law, with the knowledge from all sides that this 
law can be changed in the future if need be.  Ultimately, then, judgment has 
to be suspended, and what better place is there to learn how to lay down 
one's judgment than at a rave?  


see you all out there,
Timothy

I don't know if this made it through.  Apologies if it's a duplicated mail msg.

----
Sorry for not defining the term "chakra" in my last post.  I've been on 
such a roll w/people on the same wavelength as me that I didn't think about 
explaining it.  In fact, I integrate so much info from different places 
that I had to look it up to give you a more reliable answer.
   
Chakras (meaning wheel or vortex) defined in a really good book (Color & 
Crystals by Joy Gardner) defines it as the center of spinning energy.  This 
energy can be received, transmitted, as well as  related to social, sexual, 
and spiritual energy.  There are seven chakra points on the body and each 
one has color(s), emotion(s), crystal(s), tones and chants associated with 
them.  I don't know the history of origin but it can be traced back to yoga 
practices and to me, it seems to have a more Eastern philosophy associated 
with it.
   
So when I referred to the lower chakras in my previous post, I was 
referring to the sexual, ego, physical realm desires that drive us.  These 
chakras are located at your tailbone, and a little below the navel (to the 
left) as well as at your solar plexus.  The other chakras include the 
heart, throat, third eye (between your eyebrows) and your crown 
(divination).  These last four are more on the spiritual bend.
   
There's lots of vague crossovers in Western society (AA's head, heart and 
guts comes to mind) but info related to chakra healing and power is usually 
sought out here rather than common everyday Western knowledge.  I can go on lots
more, but I don't think it's applicable.
   
W/r/t Music manipulation, I do just want to say that there are specific tones 
and ranges that are associated with each chakra and they can vibrate specific 
parts of your body opening you up (hence my working through my chakras when 
dancing).  Have you seen a crowd going off and when the dj plays the warm 
strings, high pitched sound and they raise their hands?  To me, instincts are 
woken up deep within us and when we raise our hands, we're channeling divine 
light into us which is ineviteably to all of us and Mother Earth since were all 
connected.  Again, just my opinion, and yeah, I know people raise their hands 
all the time to other tones/frequencies, but it seems accentuated when I hear 
warm strings.
   
Your description below of what happens w/your energy w/tribal bass leads me to 
believe that you indeed feel a connection but didn't have the same terms to 
describe it as me...irregardless, it's all good! :)
   
And w/r/t OBE, nah, you don't always have to indulge or imbibe to get out of 
your body but it's nice to sometimes ;)  There's pathways each of us can tap 
into naturally to connect and transform...again, it's not common knowledge but 
training can be sought out.  For me, just listening and dancing to music can 
transport me especially when dancing in the dirt barefoot outside.  And yes, 
like you, I feel spirits and archetypical energies invoked some of these times.
   
A friend of mine described his experimentation w/dancing and imbibing as 
follows:  it's an elevator up to enlightenment and higher consciousness but you 
always come back down.  The real task is to build the stepping stones in 
everyday life to reach the same station(s).  I hope you like his description as 
much as I do.
   
Building steps and getting higher...
   
Love in white light,
Diane

Huh?
   
I gotta tell you, when I dance, I'm not OB, I don't feel any chakras (or any 
other terms not part of the general public's vocabulary).  On the other 
hand, I enjoy the hell out of dancing.  I'm a bit of a show-off, so there's 
that, but with the right music -- usually something with tons of really 
heavy, driving, ancient, tribal bass -- there's a feeling of power, of 
energy coursing through me.  In my mind, it's as though the other elements 
of the music are simply counterpoints to that booming; and then it's like 
something ancient, something that speaks to something eternal within.  I 
feel the blood of ancestors long dead come to life within me, and we are 
one, dancing infinite, moving to that beat, the puissant thrum beyond 
hearing of the earth's timeless magma heart...
   
Whoa...was I getting deep?...Sorry...  58-)

At the Martin Luther King Jr. Spundae, I could have danced all night to some 
of the things that got spun, and it was because of that energy.  But OBE?  
No, can't say that I have.  I don't suppose this requires or is aided by 
chemical assistance?

I agree with you partially, but I have a response to this:

ever heard of Jean-Paul Sartre? He said almost exactly the same things you
said; that something is only an obstacle if we choose to view it as such (I
think the example used in my philosophy book from years ago was of a
boulder in your path on a mountain road: you could either sit and whine
about it which would get you knowhere or you could accept and have a picnic
and be happy).

Well,  think that particular philosophy is problematic because it creates
alot of "pushovers": people who don't see any reason to change the world so
they just let it toss them around wherever it happens to move. I don't
agree with that because it puts too much faith in mere chance and it denies
any possibility of social change. How would the world look today if Martin
Luther King had walked around Birmingham and seen all the injustices going
on around him and said "well, what the heck, the back of the bus is pretty
comfortable anyway so I might as well be happy there."

Nothing would get done, and nothing would change.

And you're right, this IS all opinion, and I don't claim to have all the
answers either but I do enjoy a good friendly debate. (Which is why I
stopped doing speech & debate in high school :)

IMHO,
-mikey.

        We(American's), at least me, could learn a lot from Europeans, and
is. Attitudes, culture(a real appreiation for the classics which enters into
their pop culture), laungage skills(we must end our monoligual society if we
are to be true world citzens),  law & order, & crime & punishment. I'm not
saying that they can't learn a lot from us, as well.

You can see this stuff on CDs as well, though with much less detail.  And

	The Full Moon rave that was held at the water temple back a 
couple of years ago - there is a photo of it on the twenty hertz web page 
- was moved there after the San Mateo cops showed up and eventually got 
everyone to leave the water temple. There were no problems that time, but 
it is not the nicest area...

Hi there,

as a Dutch citizen/raver currently living in San Francisco (for three months
now) it's pretty interesting to see the "Chronicle blurb on E" here on
sfraves discussing the ecstasy situation back home:

> 	The Netherlands seems to be supplying much of Europe with Ecstasy, a
> happy pill that can be produced with a school chemistry kit.

I'm afraid the synthesis (by coincidence, I am a chemist) is a bit trickier
than what most people can do in their kitchen... :-( Several hard-to-get
chemicals and equipment are required.

yes, apparently Holland is one of the biggest exporters of MDMA in Europe,
probably because of the Rotterdam harbor. An advantage is that usually prices
are low and purity/quality is good, which makes life somewhat safer for the
MDMA taking part of the population. There have been some reports of
people dying at raves in the Netherlands but either these people took
excessive amounts (25 pills in one go...) or already had liver problems
at the time, overheated, dehydrated etc. Nothing new here.

Apparently former pharmaceutical industries in Eastern Europe have discovered
a new market here...

The Dutch version of the "war on drugs" is to go mainly after the large-scale
manufacturers/sellers and do not bother the individual user too much unless
he/she uses in public or commits drug related crimes (theft, murder, whatever).

Being a small country we have a similar problem as the US, that is our prisons
are overcrowded. In a case that there is little space, one prefers to put
the rapist or murderer away first and the drug dealer later.
I guess that makes some sense, doesn't it?

Anyway it's fun lurking on this discussion group, in general, comparing to
my experiences in The Netherlands for over the last 5 years, people here
seem to be much more concerned with the "social" and "spiritual" aspects
of the rave scene, while most people I hung out with in Europe appreciated
"The Vibe" but for the rest took a more hedonistic point of view. Personally,
on the attractions of the rave scene to me was the absence of an ideology
like of the former generations punk & flower power. The peaceloving pot-smokers
of the sixties are the politicians of today, and that is a scary thought...

I haven't been raving much here in SF (yet), have been to Spundae at 1015
Folsom but found the music a bit slow. Perhaps I will check out the
Mos Eisley out on Haight street which is not too far from where I live,
is that considered to be good?

Anyway, perhaps CU out there?

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        I am aware of and feel certain chakra's; usually the water, fire &
air chakra's. The water the most, this is cause I am a Cancer(Moonchild),
and am the only sign exclusively ruled by the Moon(my mom). So of course
what does the affect most, the earth gravity, what does gravity affect, water.

        Of course I've spent a lot of time inside myself(without chemicals,
and it was part of my unformal training as a licensed massage therapist),
and also with the guilded direction of others trying to help me become more
AWARE of them. For they do exsist, as many other things do that we are just
not aware of, yet!!!!

        Damm straight it does. Anytime the word synthesis appears expect the

        Ron, I'm not going off on you, hon. But I am sooooooooooo sick of
the repressive, & anal right useing children & teenagers as the catch all
save phrase for the nineties.

        Ok some facts people!!!!

        X was legal in this country until 1985, which means it had the
gloriously conservative & anal FDA's seal of approval as a safe, nontoxic,
therapuetic substance.

        Pick up a PDR, and you proabily won't find a medication listed in
there that hasn't killed, harmed, or made a human being at least sick, not
one, and in the name of health ta boot; hello!!!!! are you listening world.

        The level of understanding that's out there in the general public is
sooo scary. These people typically think that human chemistry, medicine, &
engineering are exact sciences, NOT!!!!!!

        Your constantly just trying to keep, what often seems like an
infiniate number of variables down to some reasonable finite level.

        I hear so many stories of people just being sooo unresponsible to
themselves. 25 huh, I knew & saw this one aquaintance of mine in Florida
take 8 of the Big Horse Pill dippled wafers, then do some uncut Special
K(alot), & then some Heroin; and then actually wonder why he didn't feel
good, ahHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

        Yes, he lived, but I can say he was never quite the same.

> Every day the police confiscate suspect drugs which are sent to a

> People taken to hospital with possible drug problems have samples of
> their blood sent to the National Poisons Unit which has special equipment

> reported to have taken only Ecstasy. So how did the rumours start?
> A year ago Time Out magazine ran a double page feature entitled "Bitter
> Pills", subtitled "Ecstasy has turned to agony for thousands of E users"
> as dealers spike tablets and capsules with heroin, LSD, rat poison and
> crushed glass. The story was repeated all over the place, even in a
> Danish newspaper.
> I questioned the source quoted: Stephen Beard of the Newham Drugs Advice
> Project. He was elusive, and when I finally I got him on the phone would

> by crushing light bulbs. There was no supporting evidence such as lab

> MDMA can kill a small girl" (the lowest lethal dose recorded in animal
> trials was 20mg/kilo, or 300mg for someone weighing 15kg: a very small
> girl); and "MDA is like strong LSD mixed with speed" (MDA has no LSD-like
> effects, it is similar to MDMA but longer lasting and with less warmth).
> Its as though no-one wants to undermine the established myths.
> One of these came from a satirical song in the fifties called The Old
> Dope Peddler: "He gives the kids free samples because he knows full well,
> that today's young innocent faces will become tomorrow's clientele". Its

Since Amy took the trouble to snip out Diane's query, I thought I'd throw in
my experiences.

When I listen to trance, I tend to listen to it continously for weeks, at
least 4 to 5 hours a day while I'm working or puttering around the house.
I really like to listen to a kind of hard, fast trance, what Mars calls
"cybertrance". Consequently, when I do get to a party, I've probably been
going in and out of a trance state all day.  I guess I don't need to warm
up, and maybe that's why house doesn't have an attraction for me.  Oddly
enough, after listening to enough trance, I start to really enjoy jungle.
It's like the trance stretches my brain enough so it can follow all the
beats.

Eek - MoonPup's email address chenged from "moonpup@hooked.net" to 
"moonpup@mailhost.hooked.net", so the anti-spam part of majordomo kicked 
in and bounced messages instead of letting them pass.  I'll forward the 
ones that didn't make it through... sorry MoonPup, it's all better now.

Hi,  
 
This is Monnpup testing the waters.......am I sending this to the correct
e-mail address 
 
hi everyone 
 
I have been trying for too long (years) to figure out how to get hooked up
on SFRaves, I think I have it now.................thanks to Wayne........ 
 
I never left S.F. just got tired of hearing rumors about me being a
narc.....as well as all the negativaty etc.... perhaps I was looking (or
playing) in all the wrong places.......I needed an ego check, as well as
discover who I was a little more......blah blah blah !!!!old
news........blah blah blah !!!!!! 
 
..........I have enjoyed my recent gigs alot more as I no longer need to
charge money to Dj...... 
........I have a full time job that pays my bills...........my music is my
hobby, no it's my passion..............I have seen too many Dj's just play
records......I try to be creative in my appraoch to my sets..........I'm
not over house music, but I do aim at a more funky and break beat
style.......lots of tempo changes etc.....I love the trip hop
sound.......as I used to play funk and rap etc.... in the PRE-RAVE (techno
days 87'-88' etc....) so its natural to play funkier beats. only now I like
the acid effects too. 
 
I have been going out a lot more lately........inspirational sets of late 
 
GARTH playing trip hop on the Santa Cruz Pier- this set was brought on by
too much dancing and the records were skipping, so Garth wizely slowed it
down and played about an hour of SERIOUS trip hop funky ass
shit!!!!........I was in heaven 
 
Dj TOM from santa cruz -his set at the halloween party in Santa Cruz (in
the ambient room) was fierce......fresh and original.......watch out for
this Dj. he is very good !!! 
 
MINOR MINOR (Frank Minor) another very talented all around D.j.  While
minor minor is known for his techno music, I have heard him play slower
tempos and he is very cool....... 
 
POLYWOG-I hit the shit when she played the theme from "close encounters of
the 3rd kind" very fresh and original. Makes up her own rules etc......no
faking it here. (and I wont say Woman Dj. she is a Dj period) which is more
than I can say for some of the clowns I've heard
lately..............!@#$%^&*(*#$%^&*)(*&^% 
 
DOC MARTIN -at the last wicked, doc blew me away with his set. The man has
a charisma that is un-matched (although Carlos can work a crowd into a
frenzy!!!!) 
his mixes were a tad sloppy,  but his music and energy level overcame the
mixing. 
thanks doc........I love you man.........honorable mention goes to Markie
Mark, he played a remake of a JIMI HENDRIX track with the sample "excuse me
while I kiss the sky" it was the shit.........I WANT THAT
RECORD..........markie if your here, help me to find that record!!!!!! 
 
well enough of this shit ...............HI every one, thanks to all of
those who has been supportive of me through my (retirement). i'm back and
better than ever...PEACE 
 
my e-mail address is                MOONPUP@hooked.net 
 
my phone # is                        415-337-MOON (6666) 
 
P.S. I HAVE NEW AND OLD TAPES AT AMOEBA-OR YOU CAN ORDER TAPES FROM ME
DIRECT...........

I feel Dj equipment is a personal choice.......while certainly tha technics
1200 has been the single most important item to any Dj in the last 15 plus
years, it is possible to mix Cd's now. I have learned in the last 10 years
how to mix Cd's. and like to incorperate any sound efx/tracks etc...I can
offer...............I now find myself playing BOTH during a set..........as
I did at the last Raindance........I could'nt have played a set if I was
all viynl or all CD's.......I have learned to take the best of both, If I
cant find a cut on vinyl but have a cd copy, I will play that copy. and
vice versa..........so you see it is a total personal choice
thing..........I do not condemn any Dj who only plays vinyl as he/she has
yet to discover cd mixing.......similar to all this old school/new school
rubbish.....you are who you are, you are what you play and and I enjoyed
some special parties in the old days (L.A & S.F.) and I have enjoyed recent
parties too, I think if you were lucky enough to have gone to full moons at
candlestick (3com) more power to you..........I had some outragious times
at the OLD full moons, but if I look carefully I can still find a
outragious good time.....its all in how you pick your parties........the
only difference now is you have a lot of new and unknown Dj's....... gone
are the days of exclusively seeing Jeno.Garth,Thomas.Markie Mark, Doc
Martin, Moonpup,Carlos,Ernie Munson,Dj Dan,Dutch, ETC ETC ETC.........
these Dj's are all still around only now we have the likes of Tracy, Minor
Minor, Dj Tom, Polywog, etc... etc.... etc....many many many unheard of
talents...............so don't compare    that was then and this is now
Raving always was and always will be as fun as you allow it to be.......and
personally I find as many good events to go to now as I found
before........as many of you know I went into a retirement for 2 years
because I got too involved in the negative side of raving.......who do I
blame......ME ME ME, there was always a good positive side, it was me who
allowed myself to be sucked in by the negative (drugs, rumors, posse's
etc...) and it was me that allowed myself to see the positive
again......and so now I am back better than ever (well I have been
practicing) and healthier than ever...my spirits are so high now.....I have
missed you all and hope to meet you again soon.....heres to the
now..............and too the future !!!!!! 
 
P.s. without jeno, doc,garth, thomas etc..... there would be no
carlos,dutch,moonpup, 
etc.......and so it goes ........without carlos, dutch, moonpup, etc......
there would be no tracy, polywog etc............and without todays working
Dj's there would be no future Dj's to inspire............keep up the
positive vibe............more power to the new generation.......we all
inspire each other......................

approximately 1 year now. and have been able to fool people with tapes that
they thought were vinyl mixes. 
 
if you want to come over to my place and try it out just call me at
415-337-MOON 
or e-mail me and we will set up a time. I live in the city by city
college....easy access by car or public

Hi all you beautiful people!

I want to bring up something that gets a lot of grumbling, but I don't know
if it's been truly addressed yet.

Acme Theater Safety.

I will be to the point.  From my observations there, I would like to
recommend the following to promoters of parties there:

1)  The person/people working the door can, and know how to open the garage
door at the entrance.  They should probably practice once or twice before a
party.  That door should probably be left unlocked.

2)  Most people don't know that there's a door going from upstairs to down
stairs in the middle of the building.  Upstairs it's near the bathroom, and
it leads to a closed section downstairs that is the "gallery."  A door from
there leads outside onto (is it) Howard Street.  I think a sign should be
posted on that door saying "Emergency Exit."  Even if they can't be
unlocked, those doors could be dislodged in the event of any emergency.

3)  Fire extinguishers be present at parties.  And the people be able to
operate them.

I have not seen the downstairs (basement), so I can't offer suggestions there.

Please, I'm serious, if you have a party there, ask yourself how the hell
you can get all of the people outside fast, in a panic situation.  I don't
know about you, but there are a hell of a lot of people I love that could
get hurt or killed if we aren't proactive about taking precautions.

This scene is a marvel, not only for a raving community, but for a
community in general, in the way everyone looks out for one another.  We
should not lose sight of that.

Thanks for taking this seriously.

Tony

        I'm totally in agreement with this, though i am finding it really
really REALY hard to live it lately :( Well, anything of importance always
comes with a bit of a struggle. I can't add much to what Sean said, other
than point all of you in the direction of this one web site i found which
has been really helpful for me to re-align my self and priorities lately.

        It's at: http://www.asc.org/mm_book.html
Definitely worth a look-see! :)

        Again, these are total words of wisdom, I am reminded of a section
of "Be Here Now" (the book, not the party (one of my fave flyers of all
time, btw) wherin there is a little cut out picture of a man and a woman
with various "barbie-style" clothes that are put on, one of them being a
police uniform, an other being 'hippy clothes,' we really are one species
underneath. We all feel pain, we're all hurt by things regardless of our
race, profession, hairstyle and musical choice. I'm doing my best to keep
this in mind at all times so i can keep myself off (or at least on the
periphery) of the bad vibes karma wheel ;)
        peace,

First, given the semi-spiritual, love and peace topics this forum tends to 
generate, I think this is absolutely acceptable as a rave list subject.

Second, I have to admit, I'm forever stunned and appalled at the crap that 
will bubble to the surface of society.  Hate on the web.  Amazing.  I guess 
I just didn't think members of the KKK and other white supremist groups 
would be intelligent enough to type, much less use a computer.  I mean, what 
with the limited gene pool extensive inbreeding results in, most of them 
don't have the correct number of fingers to type with anyway.  What trash 
these people are, what unmitigated wastes of human life, of perfectly good 
space and air.

Thanks so much for bringing this situation to light.

Sorry to take up bandwidth again with something that might seem lame, but...
I recently got ahold of a Scott Belt Drive Turntable (model PS60C Suffix 
A, manufactured May 1989) 
missing a belt and a cartridge.  So I did what most people would think to 
do and went to my local Radio Shack and asked to be helped.  Well, the 
guys at Radio Shack (including the guys on the other end of the phone 
behind the counter at Radio Shack) had no reference numbers at all for 
parts for this turntable.  So they suggested I call Scott (H. H. Scott, 
Inc., 5601 West Side Ave., North Bergen, New Jersey 07047 U.S.A.)
Seemed reasonable.  So I called New Jersey in search of Scott and they 
had no listings for them.  Sooooo what I am wondering is if any of you 
folks have any ideas about getting a belt and a cartridge for this 
puppy.  It sure would be nice to be able to listen to records, so I hope 
you have some ideas (and no, I can't go out and bu a 1200 so don't 
suggest that :D).  Thanks a lot again for all your help.  Peace and happy 
vibes!!

I am normally a lurker in temporary exile on the right coast, trying to keep
abreast of the scene in my beloved Bagdhad by the Bay.  As a Catholic, a
member of the GLBT community (however defined), and a parttime member of the
SF Senior Rave Posse, I have to throw in my $.02.

The hatred and general lack of awareness that exists in our world and on the
Net IS appalling.  However, IMHO, calling people names, or casting
aspersions on their geneology or genetic makeup will not bring them around
to a more enlightened point of view.  One of the things I have learned from
raving is that exposure to and a trusting attitude toward people who are
different from me goes a long way towards building a new community that
doesn't labor under the old hatreds and stereotypes.  One can pity the
ignorance that causes irrational hatred without denying the humanity of
those who spout such nonsense.  None of which is to say we should expose our
backs to the hatemongers.  In the spirit of taking wisdom from wherever it's
offered, I commend to all of you Ronald Reagan's famous line about the
Russians, "trust, but verify."  Yes, we have to educate, but we cannot
afford to simply dismiss these folx as something less than human.

A very happy weekend to all from the frozen wastes of our Nation's capital.

Love,

Paul

however angry i get, i cannot, while simultaneously calling myself a
catholic and a raver, insult the people who call me names.  the people who
persecuts the glbt community (and would probably do the same to ravers if
they knew about us) are people, too, and their feelings of hatred come from
a genuine human soul, heart, and mind.  this is the time when "love your
neighbor" really comes to mind, however difficult it is, and it is very
difficult for me to love them in the face of their lack of love.

peace, love, and hope for the now-

matt l.

        I think if they can ban Gay & Lesbian Topics from the net, I think
they should also ban hate topics, just to be fair. Because I find their so

	yup, first they'll get rid of teh gay community, and then next up 
is those damn ravers, theyre too open minded, and stand out against the 
existence of racism and teh such....
	how hard will it be to use the media to destroy our community.
	a lot harder if we are all together, and support teh gay and 
lesbian community and they can help support us.
	unity, and rave related:) tom

Ok, yes, I was trying to be humorous, but I was serious to a certain extent. 
 I'm angry to that point that I nearly mirror their hatred.  I can't stand 
what these people represent.  But let me share something with you.  I've met 
some of these people, and you know what?  They don't want to be enlightened. 
 The extreme, and even not so extreme, ones honestly, fervently, and to 
their last breath believe it's their duty to socially, economically, and 
where possible, physically destroy anyone that's not a hetero WASP.

You are absolutely correct that these views are born of a persistent 
ignorance that is handed down generation to generation.  I've seen small 
children being taught to recite the most incredibly hateful things; galling, 
spiteful, ignorant things.  Their minds are starting out from their earliest 
days twisted by an evil they can't possibly understand at that point.  There 
was a special a while back on ShowTime about racism, and part of it dealt 
with how it's handed down to the children, how they're raised believing the 
most horrible things, taught to them by their parents.

And these people are usually on the bottom rungs of our society, what folks 
back South call PWTs, or Poor White Trash.  The ones I've met and seen on TV 
always seem to possess a poor education, live in equally discriminatory 
families, and perceive no real power or control over their lives.  I have a 
theory that the pool of hatred in this country is kept burning by the 
jealousy they feel when they live futile, meaningless lives and they must 
put the blame on someone.

Ok, having said all that, I agree, they're humans.  We should follow the 
Golden Rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  And as the 
Torah puts it (paraphrased), do not to others that which you would not have 
done to you.  Let's turn the other cheek, let's treat them as humans with 
deep-seated and dangerous emotional problems.  Let's do what we can to cure 
this disease, to open their eyes, to enlighten them and make them better 
people.  

But let's also keep in mind that this hatred will always be with us.  The 
sentiments you express are beautiful and wise, but I'm a realist.  I put it 
to you that they would instantly change if they looked around and saw no one 
else like themselves.  The problem is, they are a distinct and complete 
society within themselves.  They nurture and support each other's hate.  We 
may win the occasional convert, but It is a living and breathing thing, and 
God help us, we are trapped here with It.  And the frustration that I feel 
is what causes the bile to rise in me and the anger to burn.  I would never 
act violently on it, but my conviction is strong and I will give no quarter 
to these people as long as they hold on to their hatred and continue to 
damage other people in the name of that hatred.

Most Sincerely,
Todd Grigsby

I would just like to thank those of you who are welcoming me to SFRaves, I
feel like I did when I first came to SF 4 years ago, I was welcomed by many
at the time, and while many of those people turned their backs on me in my
time of need, I have dicovered that I still have many fellow SFRavers who
share some of the same visions that I do. 
 
It is so refreshing............. 
 
 .............I would like to thank the FnF family and the gateway crew for
giving me an opportunity to play when others wouldn't. Also thanks to
Raindance. I needed your help & support to help to spread the music I have
inside me.. 
 
..I get so frustrated when I go out and get inspired by other Dj's (the
good Dj's inspire me with awsome sets and music, while the shit Dj's
inspire me to sound better than they did that night) and then come home and
blow the tops off my speakers, with no one to share my creativity
with........  
 
..........things are changing for me, and now I have outlets to release my
energy again.....THANK YOU ALL AGAIN...... 
 
......I am not too good at letting people get too close to me for fear of
getting hurt, but I am meeting so many cool people in the last 6 months,
that I am opening up again, those of you who are so good to me THANKS......

 
.......and I couldn't go without saying hi to all my favorite female
friends.......you are all very inspirational to me, as I watch you dance
and frolic your way in and out of my life.....I am so lucky to have friends
like you.......

	Lee just happened to touch on one of my favorite ideas that I 
like to throw out there when I want to hear people tell me just how nuts 
I really am...  :)   ...this being that traffic laws should be purely 
advisory.  
	In other words, a red light means "It's a *very* good idea to 
stop here until it turns green, for your own safety and that of other 
drivers, but if you feel you can run it safely, go ahead -- it's your 
judgement call.  There won't be a cop waiting to pull you over unless you 
cause an accident."
	There's no law against running down a crowded sidewalk, but 
surely there's more risk involved in this activity than say in going 75 
mph on the freeway or running a red light at a deserted intersection at 
2:00 am.
	I don't think Lee is a bad apple just because he trusts his own 
judgement in a given situation over that of a person who set a speed 
limit or put up a road sign or traffic light to cover all persons on the 
road and all possible circumstances.  On the contrary, Lee's willingness 
to rely on his own judgement strikes me as evidence of his ability to 
function as an adult and take responsibility for his actions.  I would 
only ask that he extend the same trust and respect to the rest of us.
	What's the "rave angle" in this post?  Simply that all the hassle 
we get for dancing without permits, putting restricted substances into 
our own bodies, etc., is based on the same principle as the traffic laws 
-- that we're just too fucking dumb and reckless to take care of ourselves.

Peace,

Hey all

Just picked up a new cd, probably you all know about it, but for those 
of you who don't, check out "Mystical Experiences" by the Infinity 
Project, really killer ambient!  (thanks to Adam & F8 for recommending 
it) My favorite is track 10, which is 20 minutes & 0 seconds long.  
Almost kinda spooky, I sat down to listen to it, closed my eyes, & 
found myself floating around in outer space for quite some time!  Total 
meditation music, you come to with a nice smile on your face when its 
over.  Highly recommended!

Love,
Shawna

One of the arguments that keeps popping up for "why we need government"
seems to be the "human nature" argument -- that people are basically 
aggressive, territorial, and nasty, and that we need a government to 
protect us from our nature.

I have one question: Who runs this government?

Impartial aliens from Betelgeuse?

A government is an organization started, maintained, and entirely 
composed of people.  Therefore, if you believe that human nature is 
essentially nasty, the government will also be composed of nasty
people, and everything will always be hopeless, since who's going 
to tell us differently?

Unless you believe that a world of nasty people will 
somehow permit a small clique of nice people to tell them what
to do...?  Isn't that against the very nature of nastiness that 
prompts this argument in the first place?

I do not believe that humans are hopeless, and this list (for starters)
is a great counterexample.  And since I don't believe that humans 
are hopeless, or that government is composed of impartial aliens from
Betelgeuse, I like to think that we can figure out how to survive 
without it, and that surviving without government is an easier and 
more satisfying challenge than trying to figure out how to avoid its
depredations.

ObRave:  My bet for the next predominant musical style: grind, which 
is basically jungle played at more normal house speeds, or looking 
at it another way, drum&bass trip-hop.  Anyway, it has the intricate 
drum patterns and deep bass of jungle, at a more SFO housey tempo.
Precursor to the style: MBM's "Babylon" (?)  (Lee An used to play it)

	Speaking of wildlife, a friend recently heard some sqwaking in 
his backyard and looked out to see five skunks scatter.  A couple minutes 
later he looked out again & saw two of them having sex.  The traditional 
skunk smell followed soon thereafter, he reported...
	Isn't it odd that an animal would give off the same scent during 
sex as when run over on the highway?  What is nature trying to tell us??  :)
	I would like to report that the skunks were gathered to practice 
their DJing or something (by way of making this a rave-related post), but 
unfortunately my friend did not observe any such behavior...

Laying it out in black & white,

	I saw this too, and even gave Lewis Dolinsky, the guy at the 
Chron who wrote it, a call, mainly to complain about the line "Given the 
danger, especially to liver and kidneys, why would anyone take Ecstasy?"
	He was actually pretty cool, and agreed with me that the risk 
seems to be low.  He didn't seem at all familiar with the drug or its 
uses, so I mentioned Bruce Eisner's "Exstasy The MDMA Story" and Nicholas 
Saunder's "E Is For Exstasy" as good resource/info books.  
	He didn't seem inclined to follow up with a second column 
painting a more accurate picture of the drug, but this is somewhat 
understandable given the fact that his column is on international affairs 
and the material is not terribly relevant.
	Nevertheless Dolinsky did seem surprised that I was calling to 
say he'd portrayed E in too negative a light, saying he'd expected the 
opposite when he took my call.  A few more polite calls from sfravers 
with positive experiences to share couldn't hurt, just in case he does 
have occasion to write about it again (I told him I'd taken MDMA on 
multiple occasions, and invited him to use personal information from me 
if he liked.)  
	Apparantly a major source for his story was the London Guardian 
article he mentions below, which he told me he has a copy of that he 
could make available to me if I contacted him in a couple days.  It 
sounds like a great piece, I'd say anyone interested in the subject 
should try to check it out.
	The Chronicle's phone number is 777-7111.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.  I can assure you that if I make a
mistake and kill you & your family with my car, I will take full
responsibility for my error.

>I would

I don't think so.  I trust myself because I know me.  I also know that
there *are* lousy drivers with poor judgement on the road, and I'm 
not willing to place my life in their hands.  Strange as it may be,
traffic laws make me feel freer.  It's rather pleasant to be 
able to come to an intersection and pretty much know what everyone
is going to do.  This frees my mind to spend it's energy on stuff that's
more important to me, like bopping to that DJ set blaring out of my
car stereo.

But many of us *are* dumb and reckless.  Even ravers.  We point fingers
at the institutions that pollute and destroy the environment while
blowing smoke at each other in clubs and leaving garbage around at free
outdoor parties.  Like Grigsbeat pointed out, the government is made up
of people like us.  And conversely, we're really not much different
from the poeple who govern us.  I don't believe that our problems reside
with the "system", but with human nature itself.  Some feel that given
enough latitude, humans will somehow do the right thing.  First of all,
I don't think people will ever agree on what the "right" thing is
(e.g. diversity).  The other thing is that even if we did, it would get
boring and people would start doing "wrong" things just for the hell
of it.

Nevertheless, I'm quite optimistic about human evolution.  As people
continue to gain more access to information they will learn to understand
and tolerate each other and even cooperate with those whe seem different.
And as technology continues to improve we will continue to find solutions
to many of the problems we keep creating along the way.  As people's
standard of living improves, there will be more time and energy for
our spiritual and intellectual evolution.  I see raving as one
example of our positive evolution.  We have a long way to go and it
has very little to do with the system of governemnt we are under.  It
has everything to do with the evolution taking place within each of
us as we try to understand our place and purpose in this mysterious
and wonderful Universe.

Well, you're very welcome. To be honest, I haven't been much of a "Frying
Dutchman" since I've arrived here. The very first time we (me + SO) turned
on the TV here we were confronted with Real Horror Stories of the Highway
Patrol, COP$ etc. This certainly suppressed the party-head in me somewhat...
We have been clubbing a bit but until now have not found a place where
good up-tempo techno/acid is played. I thought of going to Wicked this
weekend but my SO was ill and I didn't like the thought of going to a not so
attractive part of town like King street on my own. Well, maybe next time?
I wouldn't mind getting to know some of you folks, anybody live near inner
sunset? Have tapes with me from the Old Country + life, clues etc. and will
be staying here for a year.
This being a pretty much fragmented posting already, let me finish it with a
song ID request. On a tape a Dutch friend of mine recently send me there's
an acid track wich has as the only lyricks "It's our... phuture". Anybody know
what this is?

See you out there,


The Frying Dutchman

________________________________________________________________________________

Hello Michal.

Funny thing is, these thoughts have run through my mind as well. I asked
myself, "if someone accepts unconditionally everything around him, what
motivation would he have to change any of it, either in a positive or
negative manner?"

As we've stated earlier, there are seven levels of consciousnes, levels one
through three dealing with security, sensation, and power, respectively.
And as we've stated before the majority of the population moves around
within these three states of consciousness on a fairly consistent basis.
Their main drives and motivations are to gratify these (Maslotic) levels
through their (addictive) behaviors. Behaviors programmed from past
experience.

Having taken an extensive inventory of the past, and astutely observing
behavior in the present, one may become aware of the addictive behaviors
that he may possess. Through active reprogramming, turning these addictions
into preferences, he is now ready to take 'the great leap' into the fourth
level of consciousness - the love center of consciousnes.

Instead of acting out of fear, this person now begins to act from a
position of love. It is love that he feels inside, and it is love that
becomes his motivation. Thus, this person has reached a 'turning point'
where he has turned his life over to his 'higher purpose.' It is here that
he surrenders his power (addictions) and paradoxically becomes extremely
powerful, for he now has his 'higher direction' (intuition) to guide him
and his helping hands to provide his motivation and push him along his
path.

In reference to Napoleon Hill - the mind, free from fear, and feeling the
emotion of love, grants access to infinite intelligence - the collective
consciousness of man. Add the emotion of sex (sexual transmutation) and he
may be elevated to creative genius. It is here that a person becomes a
conduit from which the sublime passes into the world.

I believe that the wise geniuses who discovered higher consciousness had
much 'higher' intentions than for someone to 'bliss out' and be pushed
around in the ebb and flow. I'd like to believe that what they were
teaching served a great common good, from the highest order of magnitude.
It is this person, who has transcended himself that possesses great
influence, and spreads great beauty, for instead of being servant to
himself, he is now the instrument of his 'higher power'.


Thanks for your interest and insights Michal.

And thank you too, Ecto, for your insights as well. It's always a joy to
read your posts.

Peace.

Sean

Well as usual, I find myself right in the middle of the road between 
the two arguments, and I find the most practical way to look at it is 
of course the happy medium.  A co-worker of mine has something posted 
on her cubey wall, it says something like "God, please grant me the 
strength to changes those things I can change, the serenity to accept 
those things that I cannot, and the common sense to bury the bodies of 
those people that pissed me off!"  Supposed to be funny of course, but 
the first two really express how I try to be in my everyday life.  Of 
course Martin Luther King wouldn't just sit there and just give up on 
the back-of-the-bus issue, there's something to really be done about 
things like that, but also, you're not gonna waste time screaming about 
the traffic cause there's nothing you can do at the time you're stuck 
in it except deal with it.  So of course it's a judgement call on the 
part of an individual, can there be anything done about it?  If so, do 
your best to implement changes if possible, but sometimes there's just 
nothing to be done about it, & then comes the acceptance part.  When I 
am able to accomplish this second goal when the situation calls for it, 
it's amazing to me how quiet & peaceful I feel in spite of the fact 
that a million people at work have been screaming at me & everything's 
been going to the dogs around my head.  Makes me feel like I've really 
managed to accomplish a bit of inner peace, if for just a little while. 
 

Love,
Shawna

Hey all,

Does anyone know if the entire Lifesongs album is on record?  I have 
the cd and just love it love it love it!  I'm just getting into mixing

released singles what's out there?  I know I've heard some tracks at a 
F&F party.  Also where can I hook up on their music?  Muchos Gracias!

I went to this event on Friday because I really had to go out and didn't
want to posse on down to Sta Cruz and break my checking account with the
$25 surcharge :) Went with some cool friends and my sista who's the
coolest of all :) Had a fab time, but not because it was an awesome party. 

The party was located in a wherehouse on the Emeryville/West Oaktown
border.  Someone said Chrysalis was held there, but I wouldn't know.  The
hood was pretty dodgy; there was a car that had previously been broken
into parked on the same street where we parked :( But we and our car
survived! 

I'd say the party was probably not the greatest as far as vibe was
concerned.  I was in my best wanting-to-meet-people mood and therefore was
in a great state of mind.  I brought some flourescent markers to play with
in the black light and tried to share them, but people weren't very
receptive :( I really made an effort to be friendly, but people didn't
really choose to respond to this.  That was okay because I felt so good,
nothing could get me down :)  I just felt sad that people chose to remain so
closed.  The music was pretty good.  I'd say Barry Weaver who did the last
set was the best.  I danced like a fiend and really felt the music take
over my body.  My friend was a bit disappointed with the vibe to. She was
walking around yelling to the music trying to get others in the mood, but
it just didn't work :(

But our good spirits prevailed and my group had an excellent time.  I'd
have to agree with the threads that talk about each individual's
responsibility in creating the vibe.  My friends and I had a marvelous
time, but only because we contributed our positive energies to our
surroundings. 

The place was very dark.  I guess this isn't such a bad thing for some
people, but light really does something for me.  I like to see other
people's smiles and emotions and know what is going on around me.  The
darkness seemed to keep everyone at bay.  There was lighting, but they
reserved it for the last 1/2 hour, which confused me a bit.  It would have
been a bit nicer to have the light all night.  I have to say the volume
was excellent.  You could move away from the sound system and not worry
about your hearing (I always wonder about the people who stick their head
in the speakers!)

Oh yeah, they had nitrous tanks.  (I suppose I'm not supposed to talk
about DRUGS on this list, but, HEY, there is the first amendment) (sense
the sarcasm and laughter I am emitting *smile* :) Anyway...nitrous is very
interesting with techno:) Other than that it was a natural high night for
me, and I have to say, music can be the best drug out there.  It feels
amazing to let it take your body away.  I made my own energy through
positive emotions, and was really surprised with the outcome.  It felt
excellent just like the recent threads on chakras etc. were talking about. 

So, I'll leave you all with my very positive experience with an event that
could have been much less than that. 

happiness,
kc

For Shawna and everyone else,

--the original poem/prayer that you (Shawna) referred to is: 

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change, the
courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. 

--Anonymous

(this is know as the Serenity Prayer in 12-step programs, but one that we 
can surely all use)

Another related one is:
	Yesterday is just a dream and Tomorrow is only a vision, but
Today, well-lived, makes every Yesterday a dream of happiness and every
Tomorrow a vision of hope. 

Just thought everyone might enjoy these, if you aren't already familiar
with them.

Area 51 was:

surprise guest Jon Williams,
SOLD OUT 2500 tickets by 2:00am
very trancy
ASTRAL MATRIX was awsome with songs made just for area 51
exta trippy
Dutch gave speech about the 4 week court battle to try to use Richmond
and we held hands all 1600 of us who were left

we were allowed no beats in the ambient room
so I played noise from 9-12 then a band played for an hour
then mark ameba played the most brilliant ambient set I've ever heard
one of the highlights..
I brought 1500 square feet of bubble pac and the people were poping them 
like crazy...Mark played a Haters 45 that was bubble pac popping..truly 
inter-active.

highway 17 was carnage..

salutations allen@ameba

Who can you get me to come to California? I know a lot of people down there
in the Southland, may even be taking a trip soon. Regardless, I'm associated
with many of Cali's Bay Area  promoters both small & big, house & trance.
I've been trying to get people to come here for awhile. If you or a DJ you
are assoicated with needs a place to stay feel welcome. I spent most of my
time in Gainesville see ya!!!!!!

yeah, killer track huh? It's almost certainly AVeX's single 'floor control'
on the UNity label, UK import only. There's also a solid Carl Cox remix in
addition to the above mentioned mix, good luck finding it as I have tried
without much success..  anyone here know where to find a (make that several)
copies? 

 also, I would heartily recommend the next Come-Unity (this Wed at 1015
folsom)  for your next night out, its always a really nice time and is (i
think ) representative of what's best, music and vibe-wise, in San
Frandisco... here's their #  415.241.8815            enjoy!

 Sean,
 
 Reading your post and the one you responded to I can't help but think
 of a question that I had been trying to answer for a long time as
 a young boy. When at school my teachers were telling me about ancient
 despotic societies I could not understand how in the world would people
 give so much control to an emperor that eventually they were worshipong
 him as a kind of god (eg faros,roman emperors). Now I believe I'm starting
 to understand how. I found that many people in America, believe that
 we are all free and that we should blame ourselves if we don't feel free.
 But that is exactly what gives way to negative social changes
 because that is how control freaks can take over our government.
 Being complasant is offering your liberty on  a silver platter
 to those who would like to control your life.
 Your philosophy is beatiful but what do you do when dealing with someone
 like Pat Buchanan, Hitler, the KKK, Ginrich, etc. You can not go very
 far with love when dealing with organized hate or when dealing with 
 a government that embaraces and insttutionalises hate. Think of the
 fact that half of the states in the US have sodomy laws meaning that
 you can be put in prison for making love. How is your philosophy
 going to save you from such injustices. When various forces come 
 to take your librty away, if you stay passive, you are helping them.
 Think of how Hitler got to power. Most people said he wasn';t dangourous
 at first and no  one really payed attention to the 'little painter'
 then by the time they payed attention to him it was way too late.
 Fear and paranoia is bad but we have  to be careful and see who
 we have to put our armors up against or otherwise we'll have faros
 and Hitlers again. Your philosphy of love as a response to everything
 would only work if all people were like you. You are a wonderful
 person (I'm guessing based on your post) and I believe most of
 us are when we are born but many people become monsters as fears
 change their way of thinking as they get older. Once they are 
 monsters love won't always help you when dealing with them. 
 
 I'm cynical a bit I know, I wish I could share your ability to love
 everyone unconditionally
 but the more I learn about humans the more I understand that before
 you can talk to someone in tyhe language of love you have to make sure
 that you'll won't be destroyed before you even have a chance to 
 speak (6 million Jews would probably support my argument if they were
 still alive but they were killed becasue no one has spoiken up in time )
 
 peace & love (whenever possible)
 
 casy
 
 ps: sorry for the typos. I've been struggliung with my editor.

Hugh, could you forward this to the SF Rave list?  Thanks, boyo.

This is a reply to Sean Nomura's thought on life, the universe, and 
everything.  His belief that "Whatever happens is supposed to happen..."  
Just who or what decides what is "supposed to happen"?  There is no 
mention of God in Sean's essay, and who but an infinite God could 
possibly decide the outcome of everything that has happened, is 
happening, and has happened. There's nothing unusual in the rejection of 
an absurd universe in Western thought.  The idea of a design, a telos, of 
the universe goes back to before the writing of Genesis.  Teleological 
thought has been present in almost all major Western worldviews, including
Judeo-Christianity, Hegelianism, and Marxism.  The problem with faith in
historically linear progress is its failure to explain the Holocaust, 
Stalin, Pol Pot,  African famine and all other mass miseries of the 
twentieth century.  Consciousness, the quality of life, whatever, is not 
getting better for the majority of human beings; it's getting worse. 
Further on, he states that "[a]ccording to theory, there are seven states 
of consciousness..."  What theory?  Scientology?  Gnosticism?  Why seven 
states?  Why not two million, or two?  In the lower three states of 
consciousness, "...the picture(ideal) inside of your head does not match 
what is actually going on around you."  What is actually going on?  My 
view of the environment would be incoherent without particular biases, a 
particular language to express those biases without, and a particular 
perspective.  If there is some sort of universal, objective perspective 
by which to look at things, tell me about it.  And if "[a]nytime someone 
preaches their disdain...toward society, or races or cultures, the police 
dept., etc., they are...carrying themselves into lower levels of 
consciousness...", then how are we to act upon anything at all?  My 
grandfather was a cop, but I will protest police brutality, and still 
love the memory of my grandfather.  I am also opposed to infanticide and 
female genital mutilation, but that doesn't mean I disrespect the 
cultures in which they are a problem.  My own culture is, from my personal 
perspective, riddled with problems, but I still am proud of many aspects of 
Western civilization.  All teleologies have a subject; for Marx it was 
the industrial proletariat, for Judaism it's the Jewish people.  What 
is the subject of Sean's teleology?  The residents of the seventh 
level of consciousness?  Separation of human into "enlightened" and 
"unenlightened" categories can get dangerous.  I for one don't want a 
Brave New World.

Ever feel sorry for the guy who picked door #2 and got the year's supply of
anti-freeze? Why did we pick Wicked!? Yes, I know, we must generate our
experience and feelings regardless of negative influences like (bad)
environment, people, music, etc., but it helps when your surroundings are
positive.

Wicked was kind of a slap in the face of a pleasant string of amazing
parties the last few months.

Two words: meat market

Oh, and alchohol, attitudes, I-work-at-the-gap
ivy-league/macho-military/gangbanger/lamer/misc. attendees as well. This
kind of event could make a non-believer out of anyone.

Shirtless muscular but beer-bellied beat-up-corvette-driving white
pimp-wannabes with thin mustaches flexing for my unwilling girlfriend, who
almost got us killed with her reaction.

Maybe 10 real people in the place, the rest were something else, I don't
know and don't want to know. I'm not saying I'm better thant they are, I
just don't like having people like this at parties when they act the way
they do.

Lesson #1: If there's a large alchohol bar inside and one floor, go
someplace else. Lesson #2: If 5 college jocks with flattops standing behind
you in line say amongst themselves, "Fu-k man, I can't believe people dance
to this crap thump thump thump for fu-king hours!" then go someplace else.

Ok, </vent> I just needed to tell my story. Somehow we blocked out the
people and had some fun, but man was it hard. Looking forward to wiser
choices,

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Though I respect your divine right to freedom of speech &
expression, I would just like to say, that ****I***** feel 12 Step Rhetoric
has no place on this list. I have found in my own experience that most of
the 12 Step Programs & most of the so called theory behind them, though they
help many people, are repressive, binding, depressing, filled wth hateful
Christian Rhetoric, unempowering; especially for womyn, and a overall
substitute for maturity. YOU are powerful, YOU are light, not some unseen,
unproven, merricless ameba called God/Higher Power. I believe these programs
are evil for they remove self awareness, which limits growth & change with
the exception of their guide lines, as opposed to your own thoughts feelings
& ideas.

        I would be more than happy to attempt to enlighten you with regard
to these 12 Step programs and what they do to people who they can't help,
through private e-mail.........

Although there is the collection of stories on hyperreal, much of it is dated
and so I thought it might be fun to try to collect all the stories I could
and devote a web page to the topic.  Reviews of significant parties or
just inspiring memories from our bay area scene.  If anyone has any
stories or history that they would like to share, you can submit them
over the web at http://he.net/~swoosh/raves/ or email them directly
to swoosh@he.net
then if and when stories come in, I will make them available at the
above web site.

thanks-

see you all at Vision...

Hey all!

Okay, I've finally gotten around to trying this #sfraves thing again, 
so here's when I'll be doing it.  Stop by #sfraves on the IRC once 
again at 8 pm on this Thursday, my provider seems to be a little more 
stable for the time being (knock on virtual wood!), so I thot I'd try 
it again.  Anybody who still wants to know how to access it, please 
email me & I'll try to get it sorted out before the time actually 
comes.  Once again, I'll be Cerulean on it, so look for me!

Love,

Tonight's Carl Craig from Detroit, Alex, and myself. We expect a full
house, so GET THERE EARLY! Extra sound from JK and lights from Gateway.

Due to the extra cost to us this week, we won't be able to offer $1
admission before 11pm, but it's still only $3 all night.

@ Bahia - Market & Franklin.

Hi everyone... I've searched the hyperreal drug archives and _everything_
but I can't find the answer to a simple question:

what does lithium do?

I know it's an anti-depressant and everything, but there are people who
take it recreationally--- why? what are its effects-- both positive and
negative?

thanks in advance--
-mikey.

p.s. Marco Mancia are you around? I've sent you a couple of e-mails but no
response; what's your address? it's Marco_A._Mancia@sfbayguardian.com

        Sorry, but I tried to explain I didn't feel "better" or "superior"
to the crowd in any way, just bummed that so many people there were not at
the party to dance, have fun, and smile a little. I can't recall one person
smiling at anyone else the _whole_ time! I apologize for offending anyone
with my "attitude", it was not my intention.

        But, if I'm one of the people that's ruining the scene, explain how
it is so? Please do so off the list, I hate long misc. threads as I'm sure
many others do.

My brother works at GNC and last christmas he gave me some lithium to 
take to "detoxify" my system...it made my skin feel sunburnt for a while, 
but I didnt see any particular reason to do this recreationally. And 
afterwards I felt pretty much the same so as to the detox effects...I 
dont know, ask your local GNC nutritionist :) Hope that this helps

I find it fasinating how people are responding to sean's post.  I don't 
know about this seven states of consciousness stuff, but I do beleive 
that one may experience a sense of harmony and disharmony about the same 
situation.  I don't think sean was denying this(but I'll let him speak 
for himself).
I think one can be motivated to change things that they don't agree with on 
one level, but can also except the reality of the existence of it and have a 
sense of peace and harmony from that.  
Now to relate this to raving; I think of the having a good time in spite 
of the bad vibe thread.  There are times when I don't appreciate the vibe 
at a party, but find that I'm able to have a good time by taking some 
action to look within myself to find the non-judgemental place, the place 
of experience and a purer sense of existence.  In that place, 
judgements about the vibe are not as overbearing, though they may still 
exist, and I'm able to have a good time.  As I'm not being as overwhelmed 
by the "bad vibe" I can more easily find that good vibe that we all 
share.  Sometimes it takes looking further below the surface than other 
times.
Here's a wild thought, probably get flamed for it.  If hitler was able to 
spend more time in a loving enviroment and got the opportunity to trance 
out by dancing to techno, he might not have done the horrible things he did.
Of course if he was exposed to loving enviroments more in his life enough 
to make a difference, he wouldn't be hitler.

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Lithium is used in the treatment of manic depression/mania/bi polar
disorder. It's basically a salt that seems to control mood swings. It should
not be used as far as I'm concerned fro recreational use, due to the fact
that you can reach a toxic blood level if you are not careful.

OK...so probably it is a good thing thath one of the most active centres
of rave is in Germany today. Let's hope if there are any would be Hitlers
they dance out their anxiety before they start doing bad things:)

My version of this is if that Christians truely wanted to end violence
then they would argue for free love and love making instead of
abstenence. One reason why European youth commits less crime is that
they have more sex and they are too relaxed to run around killing people:)
Think about it: French couples supposedly have sex 5 times a week, Americans
2.5 times a weeks. There is too much agression there still undrained:)

peace & free love:)

Hey!

Well, the IRC works like this:  if you enter into a channel doesn't 
already exist (as was probably the case when you tried, due to various 
difficulties people's providers were having), when you enter into it, 
it automatically pops into existence with you being the only one on it. 
If you leave it when being the only one on it, it disappears from 
existence again.  However, if someone else has already started a 
channel & there are already people there, & you enter into it, you will 
not create a second little sfrave channel in addition to the first one. 
You will automatically go into the one already in existence.  So, due 
to the aforementioned problems you probably read about, you probably 
were the only one on #sfraves at the time you tried to get on.  Try 
right around 8 pm, I'll be there already!

Love,
Shawna

in my previous post i mentioned something to the effect of prohibition of 
peyote in Native American ceremonies...after redoing some research it 
appears i have this backwards...the Native American Church are exempt 
from the DEA's scheduling of peyote for ceremonial use but the Ethiopian 
Zion Coptic Church were denied this exemption for ceremonial use of 
marijuana (along with everyone everyone else)

just thought i'd clarify,

Wait a sec..I may have come to this late
But what you described to me sounds like "It's Our Future" by AWeX not
AVeX, and its on a Plastic City - America rekkid.
There are 3 mixes by Blake Baxter - Techno, House and Electro
and one track called Madness
and another Its our Future mix by Norman (its act called the Norman Remix)
It dosnt look like an import to me..the tele number is

Maybe that might help in finding it

        I'd say that the most obvious symbol to me would be the caduceus,
that pole with the two snakes wrapped around it, with the wings..ya know?
and the disk at the top? That "medical symbol" that you used to see on
"emergency" back in the 70's ;)
        I think that this is equally applicable, as the caduceus is
symbolic of the intertwining rising of energies to a point at the 'top'
(crown) where dualisms are united into a circle (infinity, or 'the
sun/enlightenment', etc). You see it on some of alex grey's paintings if
you're familiar w/them :)

        That's NICE :) i had this realization this weekend that problems
are not really 'problems' only the raw material to build a staircase to
higher states of consciousness. I keep telling myself that and it's making
everything a lot easier.
        In regards to Kundalini, i coincidentally just found a web site
about a comparison between Kundalini awakening and psychedelic use which is
at...

        http://csp.org/csp/www/docs_html/Kundalini_survey.html
        So, open those third eyes you all have and take a look ;) @)
        It's cool even though he doesn't know what DMT is (he says it's
dimethyl tryptophan or something). So, make of it what you will.
        There's also a whole LOAD of stuff on this site about a variety of
topics, i think it's one of the best finds i've had in while. Enjoy!

        Peace,
                brad "bringer of URLs, messenger of data" ;)

I couldn't disagree more. First, to claim that believing that the world is
making progress is a form of "faith" is somewhat insulting: I believe/know
that the world is getting better based on my examination of historical data,
not because I wear rose-coloured glasses and have 'faith' that things are
improving. I consider my approach to be more scientific than it is 
religious, so using the word "faith" is misleading. 
That said, I should add that I don't think anyone ever wrote that progress
moves linearly--of course it doesn't, that is self-evident. But it does
lurch forward in stops and starts, with setbacks along the way. Society 
learns from these setbacks, and in that way the world evolves. You 
mention some catastrophic events of the 20th-century, which were indeed 
tragic, but are not representative of the century as a whole: over the
past hundred years, the global standard of living, infant mortality rates, 
and human rights laws have all improved.  Human beings are better-educated
than ever before, and expanded technology means expanded global awareness
of the world's problems.  
Disasters and catastrophes aren't proof that the world is going to pieces:
they're downward turns on a long-term graph whose overall direction is 
tilted upward.

        What's your epistemological basis for this? Similarly, what's one's
epistemological basis for saying things are getting better? One's own
subjective perceptions, which are based upon a huge amount of factors. So,
i try to say "things are getting more complex" which, imho, is the closest
one can get to any sort of objective 'truth'. I suppose if one were able to
inhabit 6 billion different subjectivities, and have some sort of
'better/worse' scale in which to measure their life experiences, and still
believed in linear 'progress/regress'one might be able to say things are
getting worse or better.

        Don't quote me on this, and i'm not speaking for Sean here but i
would say that my own personal teleology is not found in "enlightened
people" nor in "god" nor in "myself" nor in "the urban proletariat" nor in
"god" or "God". I see things as having a 'grand design', one so intricate
that it seems chaotic but chaos (IMHO) is only the lack of ability to
discern pattern based on one's viewing of scale/perspective. "God" or "god"
in my mind, is not 'out there', it's a small fragment of a whole that we
are part of. We're merely a small equation in the 'god fractal' which _is_
part of a grand design. I think sean's point is that he (and i, and others)
are trying to become more and more aware (awareness being somewhat
synonymous with 'conscious') of our own position within the unfolding of
the 'god fractal'. For me, this is something that appears to unfold over
time, but this is only said because we view time in a linear way. A fractal
exists in an infinite dimension, all points simultaneously. Our progression
through it with our own subjectivities gives us the impression that 'time
is passing' or 'the universe is unfolding' but it's been here all along, is
now and will be in the 'future'. I guess the point would be to bootstrap
one's self to higher states of perspective to take in larger synthesized
visons of the world, and that process (for me at least) means ridding
myself of desires to see things one way or another, to clean my doors of
perception to see things 'as they are.' I'm not having much luck lately but
it certainly feels right to me :)
        peace,
                brad

ps-->i'm not even going to touch the whole: accepting everything/wanting to
change things paradox. I'm TOTALLY lost on this one. Similarly, if you rid
yourself of desire and expectation in your perceptions, how do you push
yourself into the future, ie: without any sort of goal, or preconception?
Akk!

Tony - your description sounds like niacin, which is used to detox and
which makes your skin flush for awhile while the capillaries near the
surface of the skin become dialated.  I've never heard of taking lithium
for detox purposes.  Are you sure this is what you took?

Michal is right, it is commonly used as an antidepressent/mood stabilizer,
and as far as I know it only works in that capacity with long-term
consumption.  I haven't heard of any recreational uses of lithium...but if
anyone hears of anything let me know.

love,
David

I can sympathize with you!!, but one lesson I've learned is that the time
you get to a party like Wicked matters alot, I got there at about 3:30 and
by 4 or so all the people not really there to dance or for the Music/Vibe
are long gone by then.  I saw many smillin faces and even met a few new
people and stayed till ~8.  Oh ya another thing-no alcohol after 2 so most
attidude starts to dissapate by then.

This was one of the better FMR's that I made it to as well, though it was 
short and it was cloudy so we didn't see much of the moon.  Also after 
the cops had shown up and the system shut down, a drum circle started and 
kept everything going for a while...  It was awesome!

Casy,
My neurobiology profesor Walter Freeman has done soem really interesting
research on meaning and intentionality, and one of his conclusions is that
BRAINS NEED SEX!  The release of oxytocin during lovemaking, and especially
during orgasm, aids in the breaking down of the 'intentional structure' in
the brain (the structure in which meaning is embodied.)  Really interesting
stuff.  Without sex, we tend to become rigid & less able to cope with
change, not to mention more fearful.  Maybe that's what happened to
Gingrich!

David

My first Wicked was in November. That was the best experience I had with
raving up until then. (That was before the Gathering in December, could
anything top that, ever?). I'd been to a few raves and had a decent time,
but that first Wicked was a transforming experience.

Was last Saturday's Wicked different, or is it me? How should I know?
But I too had the feeling that many people were there just trying to
mate. It added too much noise to the vibe.

Thanks to Tony Humphries (that was Tony Humphries right?) for letting
me just close my eyes and get into the music and dance despite it all.

see you at Vision?

I agree that Wicked was a little off this month -- they got started a little
late (doors opened around 11:15 or so) but at least it wasn't raining in the
line then -- and the music never really hit the groove that MAKES me get up and
dance.  Thomas's set was weird and often non-dancable, and Garth and Jeno
trading off was good, but too short.  Tony Humphries plays good hard classic
house which I enjoyed, but I think 4 hours (or whatever it was) is too long for
anyone to sustain a groove - sometimes we just need a change!

I was there after being sick in bed for 6 days and probably shouldn't have been
out at all, but I just had to go and hook up with my Wicked friends - who were
there and made it worth it! --

The Wicked crowed is always a little clubbier, gangier, more streetwise than a
lot of other parties - partly because it is over 21 only -- but I never see much
heavy drinking going on there --  and maybe a lot of the regulars took that
drive down to Santa Cruz Saturday --

I go out to all sorts of places (though avoid that cruisy
meat-market-won't-you-go-home-with-me-tonight-energy), and choose them based
primarily on the music, making sure it's a place I can happily dance alone
without attracting unwanted advances.

My advice, when you find yourself next to people whose vibe isn't what you need
right then ... is to move somewhere else. Find the smiling people with the right
energy and go near them! There were lots of groovy dancin' corners at Wicked
Saturday night, and some good space upstairs too.

I'd personally like to thank the people who made sure that there was toilet
paper, etc -- this is the first time I remember no overflows all night long at
that space -- so if that was the Wicked crew who asked King St to take care of
it, thanks!   Now, if we can just get the security people to chill about
flashing their flashlights on us unexpectedly like we are in Cell Block 9, we're
on our way!  (Still would love to see this party move somewhere else though!)

See you all soon!  Leslie   : )

Thank you for your glorious $0.02 and telling me just what is right or 
wrong for this list.  I didn't post the poems as propaganda for a 
12-step program.  Shawna posted a mangled version of the Serenity prayer, 
and I thought I'd provide the real thing because it's a bit nicer.  
*EXCUSE ME* for caring.  If you want a debate into the effectiveness of a 
12-step program, go for it, but take it up with me privately.  I probably 
won't debate because I don't care that much.  If you don't think it has a 
place on this list, don't read that one post, but don't tell me not to 
post it.  I was just contributing to the list as a whole. Somehow I don't 
get where you get off flaming me for a post with innocent intentions when 
you post a lot of stuff I find inane.  But, I'd never tell you not to 
post because you have a right to do what you like.  Oh yeah, I have 
plenty of experience with 12-step programs, but thanks for belittling 
me publicly about anything related to them.  That surely has a place on 
this list according to you, oh high one.  

Everyone else, I deeply apologise for the bad feelings I am creating, 
etc.  I would have posted this privately, but since Brian flamed me 
publicly, somehow I'm left feeling I should defend myself publicly.  This 
is my last post on this topic, as flaming just isn't my forte.  Nor will 
I feel bad for having good intentions.

Sincerely,
kirsten

	A quick search of my notes on psychoactive drugs turned up some info
you might be interested in. 

	Lithium is a drug used primeraly to treat manic-depressive disorder.  
It's given as lithium carbonate in some pretty high doses.  Typically, the
drug takes about four to ten days to take effect at about 1 to 2 grams a
day. Keep in mind you only take about a quarter to an eighth of this with a 
hit of E -- this is a lot of drug.  The drug seems to work by inhibiting a
neurotransmitter which promotes the manic episodes, which are caused by too
rapid transmission of information back and forth in the brain.

	Is it a recreational drug?  I don't think so.  Given how much of it 
you have to take and the length of onset (I've witnessed this one through 
indirect experience), you'd be better off seeking thrills elsewhere.  Another
question is how being *on* lithium for a while effects your experiences of
other drugs.  I have heard of funky combinations, but have no idea what they
were or what the effects were.  I think that like most things, it's best not
to mix your chemicals and leave the lithium on the shelf.

take care,

steve

Both Kirsten and Brian are saying the same thing, they just happen to package
it differently.  Many of us on this list are actively attempting to create
"serenity" or "light" (fill in your word of choice) in our lives and in the
lives of the people around us.  Whatever you call it, its still the same thing!

I feel like Brian's reaction to Kirsten's post of the Serenity prayer is
obviously coming from some past "negative experiences" and so it prompted me to
write the following (not just to Brian):

To Brian and others who choose keep the past alive:
The experiences that you have that you perceive as being "bad" or "negative"
are really just incredible chances for you to learn something new.  The most
"horrible" experience will change you for the better, if you steer yourself
without the crutch of "victim mentality".  I believe that your experiences WILL
make you stronger and more centered, but you need to stop feeding the past with
energy stolen from today.  I'm not trying to be a wiseguy or tell anyone else
how to live, I say this only because it works for me.  However, it takes a real
commitment to change your perception to view even the harshest times as
positive.

with love and respect
-a.

The communal full moon this weekend was pretty crazy.  The rain was not 
defeating though.  There were two meetings for this months project with 
many fun people working together.  The party started out under a 
freeway overpass out between Vallejo and Fairfield however the police 
showed up and informed us that we could not be there just before the 
equipment got unloaded. (nice try)  However a few of the planners 
talked to the cops and told them what was going on etc. and the police 
told us a place we all could go to have the celebration! Wow.  A note 
was left telling people to call the voicemail back for new directions. 
The new location was really crazy out in the middle of a farmland road 
near the runway of an airforce base.  The rain stopped for awhile 
however a while later was comming down pretty good.  A tent was set up 
for the soundsystem and tables with a small area for keeping dry.  A 
small altar with flowers, food, incense, candles, etc. was set up in 
front of the turntables which gave the cold wetness a little warmth.  
There was also a small fire built in the middle of the dance area which 
managed to burn even in the rain.  It was a very tribal evening with an 
amazing set by MinorMinor.  As the rain came down all who were present 
seemed to get down more and more.  Monty came on next with a terrific 
sound that sent even more shouts and whistles into the air.  About 
forty people were present and grovin.  Unfortunately some board 
sherriffs showed up who had heard about the gathering via radio and 
actually went to the old location found the note and called the 
voicemail to chase us out in the rain.  They said we couldn't be on the 
road in case of a emergancy on the runway?  I personally believe they 
just wanted to be ass holes. We were told by the last police group that 
we would be left alone and that there wasn't anything we could damage 
or disturb out there.  Oh well,  everyone got together in a small 
circle to close.  The rain started to pour at that point so everyone 
helped pack it up.  There were some great hardcore groovers there that 
I can't wait to see soon!  Hope no one gets too sick!  Well that's it 
for my review hope everyone had a great weekend!  -Claire

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Sorry, I didn't handle her respondence very well. This is the way I
usually like to clarify what someone posted rather than biting their head
off. The following a few excerpts from a post about Goa Trance between me
another person:

        Would you please clarify whether it's YOU personally who do not like
Goa Trance, or are you saying Goa Trance as form or style of Trance is in
bad taste, or artistically undesirable?

 	You could take this respondence to my post many ways, but that's what I
did to get at the true clear meaning of what this person really meant:

        My final responance to them:

        I would recommend this rather than the way I went about it, it's
much better than just going off like I did. There are just some topics I
find that choke any and all reason out of me for I find them so obsence &
offensive.

Oh shoot! I am such a dummy, I mistook lithium for niacin! So my previous 
comments about lithium are null and void and also devoid of any factual 
information and completely wrong! I have never took lithium but I have 
took niacin and it made me feel sunburnt , sorry for the mis-information.

Well, yes.  Is that so startling?  If party promoters can put up web sites, 
why not DJs?  And if not a website, then at least an email address.  You 
know, so folks like yourself could find out where he'd be next?  Perhaps 
some of the folks like yourself really like his music, y'know?  Perhaps if 
you really, really, liked a DJ's sound, you'd target parties where you knew 
that DJ would be.

Imagine that...

	*IMHO,* clearing the doors of percepton from wasting energy on 
notions of what "should" be happening, one posseses more energy to 
clearly see ones intuition, which in turn leads that one toward action. 
this action, the actulizing of our potential and intuitive drive is what 
brings about the change, because it is my natural tendency to flow toward 
love, and i (in all my imperfections) will strive for love. but i wont 
waste my time with stressing over what "should" be when the 'god fractal' 
just is, and im a part of it. 
	dancing, spreading love, being myself,
	spinning a rockin' set:)

ps. this works for me, if anyone has a view or idea that works for them, 
cool too!

Yes, it's your favorite newbie again. I just have a few technical
questions.

1. What's the difference between the SL1200 and the SL1210? I know
that the 1210 is black and the 1200 gray, but apart from that?
2. Anyone know where I can find the Vestax PDT-5000?

The following are the only differences...
the 1210 has gold leads 1200 has normal (what is normal? ones)
the 1210 has an international 110/220v switch for use in the uk
the 1200 does not.

no extra torque...or color...or anything.
thats it.

Hey I have a story:

So I'm in Las Vegas visiting with some family.  I go with my cousins to 
some cheesey casino club nite which apparently is one of the things to do 
there on Saturday night.  It wasn't a rave and I didn't expect it to be.  
I expected the worst, actually... but I had to dance or I think my feet 
would have exploded so I was joe playalong.

I report the following sensations:

Waiting in line, in a casino, right next to the nickel slots, worried 
about the "dress code" at Club Rio.
Stepping into a huge dance floor packed with hip grinders and drunken 
hipsters, watching themselves dance on big screens a-la club mtv.
BIG HAIR
asking the bartender for water, him showing me a crystal geyser bottle, me 
smiling and slapping down two bucks, and him pouring the water into a 
small, small, glass. (doh!)
asking for chapstick all the time.  (hey it's the desert, man)
goin' off to some janet jackson song mixing into blondie and making eye 
contact with a middle aged german lady who was walking by watching me 
contort and smile and she just lights up and starts 
seriously boogying and wearing one of those famous "shit eating grins" 
and then dancing with her for over a half hour and it was just such a 
welcome place to be in the whole meet marlet.  I found the vibe in las vegas.

I realize now that this probably makes little sense.

Hi y'all
 Ive got a question. Here in my hometown there are only two promoters
rrreally throwing parties. Every 2 or 3 weeks or so...ok events..I would
call them 'dances' if anything. Good sound..ok lights..pretty good vibe.
But just one problem. These promoters are hooked on not having ANY local
dj's play at these  parties. Everytime! The dj's are hired from out of
town. All the dj's here are pretty choked but other than throw our own
party..what are we to do? The dj's here have the skills to out play many,
actualy most of the dj's coming here...but the promoters aren't cluing
into what they are doing.
 In our opinion, they are ruining 'our' scene. The people here are
stopping going to these parties because of it...often not missed and
replaced by those following the dj's coming from out of town.
 I dont want to create any sort of a bad vibe...and am friends with the
kids throwing these parties...but its getting to the point that things
have to be taken control of here, before everything is ruined.
 The LOCAL scene is going right down the fu*&in tubes.
 And who's gonna pay for it? a)the dj's with no where to play
b)the local partiers with no where to party  c)local promoters 'cause no
dj's are going to play for them.
 thanx for your time  8)
Somebody out there...let me know what you think...we are getting painfully
anxious and frustrated....

 thanx for your time  8)

Excellent.  Big thanks to everyone involved for bringing techno godfather
Carl Craig to SF. Nice mix of detroit-techno & house from Mr. Craig, and a
great tweaky techno set from Alex beforhand. Unfortunately I missed Joe's
set so I can't comment. Extra sound and lighting for the occassion a big
plus.  It was cool to see such a huge turnout on a monday night. MAD seems
to have generated quite a dedicated following and has definitely evolved
into one of SF's best weeklies. Keep it up!

What are these local dj's doing?  Sitting around bitching about not
getting hired sounds like a waste of time to me.

Throw a party.  Tell your friends to throw parties.  House parties.
Barbeques.  Saturday in the park.  whatever.  Just do it.

I agree wholeheartedly with Andy's post.  It's terribly unfortunate that
some ASSHOLE felt the need, cathartic or otherwise, to tag the men's
bathroom in big green magic marker.  Personally I feel there was nothing
magical about it, and I'm rather glad the perpetrator wasn't seen, or
caught, for risking the loss of such a nice weekly would have caused swift
and emotional ejection I'm sure.

There's a time and place for almost everything, it's just unfortunate that
people's egos, timid as they may be, override their judgement.

It's more than just 2-cents, it's fucking common sense and a little bit of
curtesy thrown in.  The actions of the individual are reflections on the
whole.

The good of the many outways the good of the few 
 
If you don't have something good to say don't say anything at all 
 
don't throw stones when you live in a glass house 
 
take a negative and turn it into a positive 
 
something good comes out of something bad 
 
 
 
These are all terms (or call them cliche's) that I have heard over the
years, that come to mind when I read some of the tripe that some of US are
posting, Even now I find myself guilty of being negative in trying to
convey to you that WE as a community must ALL try to attain a higher
ground. 
 
I have had my own self demise within "the scene" as we all like to call it,
as many of you know. The opinion's that I have had of people, Dj's,
promoters, clubs, music, drugs, etc.....basically any thing related to our
life styles (clubbing or raving etc...) got me in such a bad place as a
person that I had to drop out for several years to try to find myself. 
 
I don't claim to have found myself of become any less addicted to the
lifestyle, but I do try to be more aware of what I say and do now, because
it can offend or tred on someone elses dreams or aspirations. 
 
I try to take the same attitude as I have when I make a Dj tape, that is
that I won't ever allow a tape to leave my house that doesn't have the top
quality that I would expect of myself. That tape represents me and my
style, mood, creativity, etc...at that time in my life.........my anal-ness
about the quality level only helps to insure that who-ever listens to that
tape (even years down the road) will be able to have a good impression of
moonpup (as far as his ability to mix a Dj tape) of course if you dont like
the style of music, you don't like the style of music and thats o.k. too.
Thank goodness we all have different tastes, or this would be a boring
world. 
 
But the point is If I post a lot of positive uplifting informational
exchange etc.....rather than a bunch of critisism of others within my own
community, am I not taking the steps to HELP make our community a better
place (as we all preach that the raving lifestyle is)  
 
I cannot change any one else or their choices to rise higher or dig deeper,
I can only help myself to become a better person, only then can I feel like
I am a positive force within my own community.  
 
I paid a huge price....loss of status, loss of $$$, loss of self dignity,
etc....It was only after I realized that everytime a negative event
happened to me (hassles with promoters, $$$ hassles, Dj ego's, etc...) I
was the common denominator, only then did I realize I needed to move on and
sort ME out.........Not have every one else change their tune to suit me. 
 
I may still have a negative attitude towards certain issues, promoters, and
other aspects of our community, but I try to keep that to myself now, or if
I'm not enjoying a night out at a club or rave, I can always leave !!!!!
No-one has to endure a shitty atmosphere, and If you don't go to shit
events they can no longer survive. 
 
I hope that none of us are helping to support the lower elements that exist
in our community, I personally feel that as far as the ongoing debate about
the old days verses the current days.......I remember shitty events in the
old days and I know that shit events can still occur today......and I
remember great events from the old days and I have gone to some killer
parties lately.........It will never change 
 
The reasons why we all go out and dance etc....are all different, just as
the drugs we all like are different, we all like different music, have
different sexual desires, etc.... 
.......so ultimately  you will never find the perfect world........If you
do more power to you............but if you don't ask yourself......... 
 
What are you doing to improve the situation ??    Take a look at yourself
an ask yourself.....Are you the best you can be ??     
 
I know from reading some of the postings here lately we have some really
powerful people within our community, When I read Leslie Ayers postings, I
am inspired. This woman knows how to turn someone elses negativity and turn
it to a positive. 
 
YOU GO GIRL. People like me who are still trying to find the right balances
and attitudes in life, lok to people like Leslie for guidence.......Thank
you 
 
I am sorry to have to post a message with a message.......but I was just a
little dissapointed in some of the negative energy I am seeing
posted.....please forgive me 
 
 I am a new member of SFR and by no means do I claim to have the answers, I
just would like to think that we all aspire to be positive, and free of all
the negativity that we have in the real world........This is a positive
place for me to hang out.......and I want it to be for ALL of US !!        
               peace and remember    ITS ALL GOOD !!!!

My advice to you is to start your own parties. go grass roots level start
with small after hours or a small weekly in a dive that needs the help and
will allow you to do whatever. 
 
Have small parties outdoors 20, 30, 100 people, small  (it was never about
the size, but the vibe.) create your own vibe and the other promoters will
do what they will (if they are truly your friends, they will want to join
of at least attend and support you events). 
 
But if they are about the wrong things ($$$, status, etc...) they will not
support you, and thats probably just as well.......  
 
good luck and I wish you well . if things go good, before you know it you
will be yourself wanting to hire outside Dj's to play......its a funny way
that the world works 
 
Where are you from? (I am suspecting Maui). I went to a small party at the
old schoolhouse in Paia (jan 95) It was fun......well keep us informed of
your progress....

[ This will be my last post concerning this matter ]

>This is a reply to Sean Nomura's thought on life, the universe, and
>everything.

First, I'd like to state that everything I believe about life and the
universe has come from the collective works of others - Jesus, Leo
Buscaglia, John Bradshaw, Dan Millman, Ken Keyes, Robert Ringer, Andrew
Carnegie, Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, Anthony Robbins, Buddha, Lao Tsu,
and Confuscious to name a few.

Okay, so that's it? NOTHING but an INFINITE GOD could POSSIBLY decide the
outcome of everything that has happened, is happening, and has happened?
This is a classic example that man is arrogant enough, and possesses
audacity to believe that he grasps the absolute truth of the makeup,
structure, and meaning behind the design of the universe - even within the
confines of his feeble language, his feeble reasoning ability with his
extremely limited perception. I find this almost comical.

Who's to say what 'it' is that really 'runs' this universe, if, in fact,
that really is what is happening? Must 'something' be 'running' 'anything'?
Can we, in our own limited language really slap a label on 'it'?
Particularly, if something is beyond our perception, and our comprehension,
then how could we even begin to define what 'it' is?

>From my understanding dogs can only see in black and white. And could you
imagine a caterpillar with the aptitude to count to ten, or a sea anenome
that can comprehend what 'hearing' is? As I observe that they are unaware
of their limited capacities for perception and intellect, and at the same
time being in absolute awe of the genius, complexity, beauty, and harmony
behind the universe's marvelous and intricate structure, I can only imagine
how limited and fallible the perception and intellect of man must be.

So, in reference to your question above, all I can say is, that for me,
I've spent literally hundreds of hours trying to figure out what 'God' is
for me. Thus far, I have not been able to come up with a definite answer.
All I can say for sure is that I do indeed believe in a 'creative force,'
as feeble as that defninition and terminology may be... but it's all I have
to work with. 'Higher Force?' 'Higher Power?'... For 'sure' it's a 'Higher
"Something"'.

This is a good and fair question. If you're REALLY interested there are
EXCELLENT books I can recommend, the first is "Sacred Journey of the
Peaceful Warrior" by Dan Millman, and the second (much more in depth) is
"Handbook to Higher Consciousness" by Ken Keyes, Jr. (This is an excellent
book... cutting edge stuff!)

It would? If I observe that a ball of lead and a ball of plastic fall at
the same rate in a vacuum there is NO bias as to which ball may or may not
hit the ground first. Being coherent of the environment and having biases
do not go hand in hand. Bias certainly does give rise to subjection,
personal perspective and opinion, but is practically an antonym for the
coherence of an objective environmental observation.

To answer this, I offer the following analogy:

Let's say that this man (we'll call him John) is a really 'uppy' kinda guy.
He (like most of us) worries about his job, his home, his security, and due
to stress, the muscles in his neck and shoulders become tight and knotted.
Due to the knots and tightening, he begins to have headaches and stomach
ulcers.

So now what is John most likely to do? Take an aspirin for his headache and
an antacid for his ulcer. If they're persistent he'll probably visit the
doctor for a STRONG presecription. Yeah. John's not going to let those
ulcers and headaches get the better of him! And then let's say that these
uclers and headaches persist for 2 or 3 years. John is highly likely to say
"I'd be happy if it wasn't for these stupid headaches and ulcers!" The
doctor may even have told him that they're due to stress. But what does
John do? He keeps taking the medication. But you have to understand, this
isn't John's fault. He's probably been 'trained' to handle these situations
this way since he was born.

Can you see the problem here? John is pointing the finger at the headaches
and ulcers. What's more, he's using his time and energy doing blame and
battle with them. He is doing nothing but treating symptoms. But what is
the real culprit?
John WORRIES. It's all John's choice, of his own state of mind. Should John
decide to stop treating symptoms and go after the problem at the source, he
is not only on his way to a more peaceful state of mind, but a healthier
body.

People (presently) are so quick to point the finger at society, the
politicians, the companies dumping toxic waste into the rivers, the oil
companies, the lust-for-money-and-power capitalists. These entities are not
the problem with society. As Lee Fogel has addressed earlier, they are
symptoms of the problems with the overall human condition. And because most
people were trained to blame and battle these entities since birth, that is
what they believe is the solution to solving the problems of society.

If you're dissatisfied with society, then go after the problem at the
source. Make people aware that they have a choice over their own states of
mind. Have them utilize thier energy upon improving themselves (instead of
attacking others). As one who preaches this philosophy, you do the same. As
everyone begins to do their part to spread a philosphy of a peacful states
of mind and higher consciousness, the overall standard in the states of the
human condition begin to rise, and, slowly but surely, the symptoms that
plague society by the lower states begin to fade. (This may sound a bit
optomistic, but I believe that this is happening even now in mankind's
societal evolution, or at least the seeds are being planted.)

                        All teleologies have a subject; for Marx it was
>the industrial proletariat, for Judaism it's the Jewish people.  What
>is the subject of Sean's teleology?  The residents of the seventh
>level of consciousness?  Separation of human into "enlightened" and
>"unenlightened" categories can get dangerous.  I for one don't want a
>Brave New World.

Ecto and Timothy have already commented (very eloquently) on this as well.
I would like to add something. It is lower states of consciousness, greed,
power, fear that gives rise to separation between peoples and their
environment. It employs a "I-them" and "me against the world" type of
philosophy. Higher states of consciousness gives rise to feelings of
CONNECTION between other people and with the environment. I, for one, do
not opt for a world of separation, but one of unity, and a connectedness
with nature.

This is not meant to be taken sarcastically, but better a 'Brave New World'
than a 'Fearful Old Scrapheap'.

Thank you for your insights Hugh O'Connor.
You ask very intelligent questions.

Peace.

Sean

Well, with all the wild and wonderful things going on in my life, I'm
finally taking time out to rave again this weekend at Vision. In fact,
my friend is rounding up an large representative body of The Community
Experience to show up at this one, so we can make a massive
contribution to the vibe.

I'm excited at the opportunity to seek out the faces associated with
the e-mail addresses on this list. I've heard about the laminates, and
downloaded the GIFS from hyperreal, but, alas, I have no access to a
color printer! Is anyone out there in the process of making laminates?
At the very least, is anyone willing to do a color printout of the
images for me, so I can "roll my own"?

P&L,
George

So does this telecom bill which Clinton promised to sign still contain 
the heinous communications decency act (a.k.a. asshole moral minority 
censorship)?
I'm not sure what's going on... all I know is that the CDA is a bad thing.

hi...

get together with your local dj's and have a house party with your 
friends.  i'm an old fogey (just kidding) but, i really like the intimacy 
of a smaller party and knowing the dj's, ect.  that's what we're doing up 
here in portland and i've gotten a really good response from local dj's 
who really know how to spin and it creates a real community energy that 
adds to that ever wonderful VIBE.

have fun!

Wow, it seems like every week the MAD reviews glow brighter and brighter...
Could someone remind me of its location again?  I'm going to try and check
it out next week for the first time.  MAD is a product of Ethan's handiwork,
am I right? I think Ethan is the King Midas of the SF scene...
see you guys out there,

Actually, Mad was created by Alex, Joe Rice, and Jon Santos, as well
as Ethan.  They have all done a great job in establishing a weekly

Oh stop, you're making me blush =)

Actually, MAD was first conceived by Alex Windsor of Gaia Mantra fame; the
rest of just glommed ourselves on as fast as we could =)

It is definitely a group effort though and wouldn't be nearly what it is
without the musical and other contributions of all its members (Joe, Jon,
Alex and myself) not to mention the wonderful music and energy our guest
DJs and friends bring every week.

Special props to Gateway for lighting and lasers monday night and to Rob
the Audio Angel for the biggest bass in town =) And of course to Carl Craig
for techno in the first place, and for dragging his butt out here in the
second. Nice one.

Thanks again for the support, we really appreciate it!

Yes, it does.  But, I read that if it is signed it will probably be held
up in court for years because of 1st Amendment violations.

the following opinions are solely mine and are not in representation of 
Teleport Internet Services... 


since i love you guys so much i thought i'd pass this opportunity onto 
those here who may be qualified for this project.  our company, teleport 
internet services, is looking for someone to program a setup wizard for 
our win95 download.  microsoft has offered to give us rights to MSIE 
which has a setup wizard in return for us only supporting MSIE (and we 
have to plug them on our web page...yuk!) no more 
netscape.  my dept voted a unanimous NO!  netscape wants to charge us a 
whole lot of money to use their version with the shiva dialler...we're 
still negotiating.  what we want is to have our OWN wizard so we can 
continue to support our users no matter what browser, mail program, or 
news program they choose and we could probably do it ourselves but it 
would be a long project and we can't afford to lose any people to a long 
project since we have almost 18,000 users and adding about 300 a week 
(including RuPaul he he he).  

if you're interested, please email me personally for more details.

spend my countless hrs online everyday, but the outpouring of support 
you all have shown today I will hold onto to show them.
 Ive already made the contacts I need..the plan is in the works..the 
vibe will again be alive and I can't wait.

 Anyway...to all who responded to my dilemma thankyou very much.
 Consider your self all invited...and I want you here if you can do it.

Hey all

    #sfraves  on Thursday February 8th at 8 pm:

Okay, to all who have asked, & to all who are interested, here is some 
more info on joining up on #sfraves.  Even those of you who know how to 
do this may want to read this cause there's some specific stuff to do 
to get on with optimum (hopefully!) irc performance.  

Ok, to get onto irc from a normal unix prompt, type:
    "irc nick ircserver"
    example, for me I would log like this 
    "irc Cerulean irc.winternet.com"

Black Adder has suggested we use irc.winternet.com cause it's part of 
the Undernet & he says it's gonna be faster (thanks for your help 
pat!).  Therefore, less lag time & hopefully this should solve the 
problem some of us had, remember how you'd go on & talk, & nobody'd 
respond, or there didnt appear to be anybody else there?  So just type 
like it says up there, with whatever nickname you wanna use in place of 
"nick"!  

For those of you intersted but not familiar with irc, a couple of other 
things (I cant remember if I mentioned it before or not) you can do 
once you get on are:

To see who else is on the channel with you:
    type "/who #sfraves"

To "talk":  simply type whatever you want to say and hit enter.  What 
you type will then appear on the computer screens of anybody else on 
the channel.

To see more information on the identity of another person on the 
channel:  type "/whois Cerulean"  (for example)

To leave the channel, I *think* you type "/leave".  Those of you in the 
know about this one, please correct me if that's wrong.  


That should be enough to get us started!  I do have a favor to ask, if 
it's okay, I was hoping people would show up reasonably close to the 
starting time of 8 pm.  This is cause I have to show up a few minutes 
before 8 to "greet" people as they come on, and while I wait for people 
to show I have to sit there staring at my computer until somebody 
shows, so that when they do show I'll notice it and say something, & 
they don't think that nobody's there!  No fun sitting there waiting for 
people to show for an hour!  Even if just a couple people show that's 
cool, so I'll have somebody to talk to!

Anyway, I hope to see you guys there, if you have any more questions, 
please email me.

The Serenity Prayer was around *long* before the 12 Steps came along.

I think the Serenity prayer is a great mantra; if you're athiest, 
then just meditate on serenity, courage, wisdom.  Anyone got a 
problem with that?

Persons of spiritual maturity, (and I percieve this group as valuing 
that) seperate religion - the "Cliff Notes" of enlightenment - from 
the original messages of adepts.   They don't need to throw the
baby [Jesus] out with the [holy] bathwater.

Peace be with you on your quest, brother.

Actually irc.winternet.com is part of "Efnet" or the "Overnet," (just so 
there is no confusion for those coming through other sites.) 

You can also use irc.texas.net, which seems to be lightly loaded.

Type "/leave #sfraves" (but who would want to) to leave the channel.

Type "/quit" to exit IRC, or alternately you can kick your computer. The 
latter method is not suggested.

I am posting this as a favor to a friend.  She's throwing a small house 
party this Friday (9th).  She has one dj who is spinning hard trance and 
is looking for another to spin who also has speakers and an amp.  Right 
now all they have is stereo speakers and it is a sad state of affairs to 
ruin good music by using them:(  Anyway, if any of you aspiring dj's 
would like to spin and has the required equipment, email me with your 
phone number and I will pass it on to her.  Try to do this before 5 p.m. 
tomorrow (Thursday). I don't have any more information except that it is 
in Berkeley, near the campus, and is a student house. I don't promise 
roses, but you would get to meet cool people with smiley faces who would 
appreciate your music!!

Thanks a ton,
KC

well, we have to decide on _one_ so we don't end up with the confusion of
last time. Since irc.winternet.com was the first proposed, how about that
one?

Yes, we'll stick with irc.winternet.com, as previously planned.  It 
seemed to work just fine for me before.  If it is STILL a problem, we 
can figure it out from that point.

I just got my mailing from the George Coates Performance works about
his new show which starts next week " Twisted Pairs ".....

  Annette Diva plays an Amish farm girl who finds a solar powered laptop,
leaves the farm and joins a para-media militia. She meets a cast of
characters from chat rooms and news groups: alt.support.relationships,
alt.romance, alt.couples, alt.divorce, alt.bitterness, alt.sarcasm and
alt.beer....

  Coates has done some wonderful multi image, high art performance works
during his many years in the Bay area and usually features excellent
electronic scores of composer Marc Ream. For those who have never experienced
him before - expect a zany twisted look at reality or surreality which
combines comedy, music, theatre, and many types of projected images... great
stuff kind of like theatre on LSD....

  Preview shows this week Opening night Feb 14 ($15-$34) all seats are good
since the Performance works is smallish on McAllister near Brooks Hall.
Performances Fri, Sat, Sun thru March 10 . (Couple of bucks less on Sun )
415-863.4130  or http://www.georgecoates.org for info...


Mike says check him out - most people with an alternative eye view really
enjoy his work....

Don't forget Tanya, Nancy, FIxer and Jake for helping with the door.  It

No thanks to the Green Markered tagger.  Dave and I spent 20 Minutes trying
to scrub that shit off.

No, you can use either one interchangebly. They both have access to the 
same channels.

Hi everyone,

Regarding the Telecom Bill and the Communications Decency Act, check out 
the home page of the Blue Ribbon Campaign for Online Freedom of Speech, 
Press and Association (http://www.eff.org/blueribbon.html#intro). You'll 
find information about the bill and its implications, plus a list of 
sites that could be banned. Worth reading, I think.

Peace (and free speech!),
Kathryn

SUBJECT: Happy Thursday


 Welcome back, Mark.

 Good luck snowboarding.  I went for the first time last Saturday and
 may, when feeling masochistic, give it another try.  Despite the
 great bodily abuse and the fact that my butt was just a giant bruise
 I had a pretty good time.

  For some reason this raving skiing/snowboarding trip with a bunch
  of ravers headed to the slopes suddenly came to mind...

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I'm starting to think the laminates were actually a gift from a cosmic
traveler.  He met some of the sfravers on a galactic raving roadtrip, and
made these for them.  Thats why no one can ever get one again, not until he
returns.

If anyone has info on our interstellar rave star who mints these precious
little items, drop me  a line.  I'd really like to have one too!
Love & Life,
Steveo

first of all, how does one diferentiate between OverNet, UnderNet 
(dalNet) and EFNet.  I assume they are all different network systems.  
Also, Mr. Adder, if everyone goes on the same server, the likelihood of 
all of us experiencing a net-split would be reduced.  I propose we go to 
irc.sdsc.edu, for in-state irc fun.

I am probably about to start a big uproar about this, which is not really 
my intention... My knowledge comes merely from experience and the FAQ

	The 1200 and 1210 both have standard alloy/steel/aliumium leads, 
the 1200MKIII has the gold leads. Many of the 1200s have the voltage 
switch, this comes from the tables having supposed to be shipped to 
another countr (the model or serial number will tell you which). I have a 
pair that was suppose to end up in Austria if I remember the code 
correctly - SL1200MKII-xxxxxxxxx-au or maybe it was austrilia, the FAQ 
says).  

> no extra torque...or color...

	The color is actually the only thing different between the two - 
the 1200 is silver the 1210 is black. Someone once posted a way to make 
your 1200 into a 1210 cuz the 1210s were more aesticly pleasing to him in 
the dark...

Hmmm, I think you've got something there!
Last year I organized a snowboarding/cabin trip, some boarded some just
chilled and spun records/hot tub'd at the cabin.  It went quite well! I
propose we do this again, on a slightly larger scale(15-25 happy peoples).
 I've got a connection on cabin rentals at tahoe, no discount, but good
cabins.  It ends up being really affordable, like as low as $20/person/wknd.
Does anyone know anyone with a cabin up there?  This sounds like an excellent
opportunity for extra-ravicular bonding activity! Email me direct if you're
interested.  And remember, It's not just for snowboarders, there will be fun

I'm into it.  I just bought a new snowboard yesterday.  I'm totally into it.
I can bring my new mixer(which has hardly had any use cuz two days after I
got it one of my tables broke).  It's a Numark PPD 2060.  Works really nice.
I can bring my cd player, cd's, and records and spin ambient to chill
everyone out after a hard day snowboarding.  Let me know what I gotta do.
All we need now is an amp...and if I can get my friend Eric to go he would
probably be willing to bring his amp and we'd be set.  Let me know.

Overnet and EfNet are the same thing. Undernet is different. Generally 
the greeting message will tell you which network you are connected to. I 
would definitely suggest that *no one* use irc.sdsc.edu. It is normally 
over-loaded as it is very popular and the last couple of times I have 
tried to connect it has denied access due to the over-loading. The two 
IRC addresses I have given are very lightly loaded and should offer 
excellent performance. I have chosen these as the default addresses for the 
system I administer, so I have had some chance to monitor them. Thus the 
chances of net-splits are low.

Ya, I'd be totally into this.  My pop has a cabin in Sanora.  but I dont think
he'd be too happy about 25 Ravers invading his house for the weekend and its
kinda far from Tahoe.  I've got an amp I can contribute and can even play some
live ambient stuff.

Lets start thinking of some dates for this.  I can do it anytime except the
weekend of Feb 17th.

I went to this last Thursday and had a great time. They turn all the
automatic scoring monitors into video displays with party videos, they
have a large screen video too, they dim the lights a bit more than
usual with the pins still well lit so the environment is more comfy
than bowling alleys usually are. Everything is included! $6 pays for
shoes, bowling, and pool tables. You can bowl as much as you want, or
until your arm falls off (as mine almost did). The DJ is right behind
you as you bowl, and the sound is good in front of the speakers.

Last week DJs I say were Adam, Tracy, Mars, and Mark of Ameba (?) in
the ambient bar. All these guys made me happy to hear'em. It's amazing
how nice it is to dance on a wood floor with bowling shoes on! There's
plenty of room too. It's really just a great place to hang out, even
if you won't bowl. The idea of it all just kept me giggling with joy
all night.

I think lasers would match the linearity of a bowling alley in magical
ways, and when I get all the little mirrors glued on to my bowling
ball ...  :)

Bowling isn't just for punkers any more!

Thats the only reason why you have the switch. They weren't made for the US, they are

No its not...come see my black 1200's and Ill prove it.
Just because its not available in the US, doesnt mean it doesnt exist.
(Im not saying you are saying that....lots of people do tho :)
You can order 1200's in BLACK or SILVER in Canada. Same price. Same TT.

	Yes it's true, when life is safe and predictable we have less to 
worry about, and in a sense this makes our minds "free".  A good example 
is someone who is in prison.  They don't have to worry about job 
security, because they have no job.  They don't have the stress of 
relationships, because most often they have none.  They don't have to 
worry about roomates, school, family, or even safety on the road, because 
they won't be driving.  Some writers and other people have had growth 
experiences from time spent in prison.  But when it comes down to it, 
most of us don't want to be there, despite the relative security.

	We ravers are not perfect, as Lee is right to point out, and there is 
much room for improvement.  But when Grigsbeast said that government is made 
up of humans, not aliens from Betelguese, I interpreted his remarks to 
mean that people in government, like people everywhere, will make 
mistakes -- NOT that people in government are just like people who go to 
raves.  People who go to raves are usually interested in having fun.  Fun 
is not high on the priority list of most people in government.  If it 
were, they would be less interested in law and order, and more willing to 
let people do their own thing.  I have to disagree, Lee.  Many of our 
problems *do* lie within the system, because the values that we practice 
as ravers (aside from the littering and such, which seems to me to be 
much less evident at outdoor raves than at other outdoor events) are in 
conflict with the puritanical, consumer/control-driven values promoted by 
our government.

> Lee

	If the human evolution Lee (and I) look forward to is based on 
access to information, technological improvement, and better standard of 
living, then the government we have today is clearly counter-evolutionary.  
Our government is trying to restrict information (as in the censorship of 
the Internet), while it frustrates technological improvement by taxing and 
regulating entrepeneurs, and reduces our standard of living by spending 
and borrowing at the expense of the younger generation. 
	Because government is such a drain on the economy, we live in a 
society that is increasingly work-centered as people have to work longer 
and harder to maintain the same standard of living while government grows 
ever-larger.  Americans are working longer and longer hours, yet have less 
spending power than 30 years ago.
	A work-centered welfare society does not value activities such as 
raves, and will not be inclined to respect the rights of those participating 
in such activities, because we will be seen as living at the expense of 
society rather than rolling up our sleeves for the "common good."
	This mindset explains comments like the one I heard at the San 
Francisco City Hall hearings on the ban on dancing after 2 a.m. for those 
under 18:  "Dancing all night has no socially redeeming value," I recall 
one supporter of the ban saying.  :(
	I do share Lee's view that the real path to evolution lies inside 
each of us.  However our environment plays a big part in shaping our 
attitudes.  Just as it may be difficult for "tough" kids from a "bad 
neighborhood" to adopt the peaceful way of the raver, so I feel it is 
more difficult for all of us to become loving, non-controlling, happy 
individuals when we live in an environment where the law takes people's 
earnings without their consent, restricts freedom, and devalues fun.
	This is the equivalent of living in a cultural ghetto.  I am not 
sure that real evolution of conciousness is possible on a mass scale in 
such an atmosphere.  
	As Bill Clinton put it, the era of big government is over.  Now 
we must have the courage to change.

Peace,

Although I definitely can not agree with rascism, hatred, xenophoby and bias against other human beings, I can not condemn whoever does it and wants to put it on the WWW.

Everyone has the right to express their ideas, even when we think it is wrong. If Aryan Nation wants to have a site in which they want to express their opinions, I can be offended but, hey.. they have a right to do so, as much as i have the right to publicly condemn them for that. It's just freedom and democrracy.

That thing should even apply to this "GLAAD" thing. If I don't like gays and lesbians, why can't I dislike them??? If they can have WWW sites, propaganda, if they can do everything to promote their cause, why someone who hates them can't??

I hope you got my point. We can condemn other people, but we shall keep in mind that they have a right to have their opinions and express them in public. I publicly condemn this GLAAD thing, if they are willing to ban whoever hates them from the access to a public place such as the Internet.


Take it from me, I can't even support rascism or sexism. I lived in the US for many years and I have been a victim of xenophoby and rascism at raves in the U.S., so
I am pretty much aware of this subject.

Well I just tried to get onto the IRC using irc.winternet.com & it

So, if this happens to you guys, try the previous suggestion of 
irc.direct.ca instead,  that worked for me the last time I did it.

	If David is correct, this could also explain Bill Clinton.  Back in 
the days of (Gennifer) flowers before he was elected, Bill probably got 
plenty of sex.  He used to love the idea of change, and talked about it 
all the time, remember?
	Then once he got elected, something changed -- he did.  Perhaps he 
was so busy and stressed out being Prez that he had no time for Hillary or 
anybody else.  That would really be a shame.
	If you read between the lines though, Newt Gingrich may be trying to do 
something about this.  Remember him complaining that he couldn't sit up 
at the front of the plane with Bill on that trip to Israel?  Newt's 
sister is gay, and sometimes where you find one same-sex oriented sibling 
you will find others.  Maybe the real reason Newt quit going to those 
closed-doors budget negotiating sessions is that Bill wouldn't put out.
	OK, maybe that's not the reason, but more sex couldn't hurt.

For free love & free markets,

My Brothers and Sistas...
Unfortunately I have been too trusting too long.  I brought a very 
expensive camera to the party, which I left unattended under a seat, 
under a jacket, in the stadium.  A few hours later when I went to check 
it, it was gone.  Stolen goods include:  Minolta 400si camera, green 
umbrella, drivers license, school id (UCSC), lip balm,etc.... all neatly 
enclosed in a black "tam tek" camera bag, which had a yellow happy face 
pin on the front.  I am just now posting this because the shock has 
finally diminished... booo hoo...  Well, besides the hassle of getting 
new id's, I was taking pictures for a photography class which I happen to 
take very seriously.  Now in quite a jam for finishing the class 
requirements.  If anyone has any information regarding my belongings, 
please get in touch with me.  If nothing more, I would at least like my 
Id's back, and the film.  Fuck the camera, it's only a material thing.  
(not as if it would not be graciously accepted, should someone want to 
return it...)

	So... the other issue at hand is crime in our scene.  We should 
be able to trust each other.  Is this not one of our most basic values?  
If we cannot trust in the love we share with each other, it makes our 
efforts seem quite superficial.  I am sadly in need of some reassurance 
and would appreciate your thoughts on this, and your help if possible in 
the search for my stolen goods.  
 
I suppose that about sums it up.  Peace and Love, anyhow.

I considered this of sufficient importance to post to this list because of
the unique interplay of  TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY which it represents.  All
varieties of moral, ethical, legal, economic and other issues are bound up
in this situation.  This is a real STS tar baby if ever there were one.  For
more information, please point your web browser to Yahoo's home page at
http://www.yahoo.com/ before Feb. 10.  Surely, information will be available
after that date, however, for this issue is far from being resolved for
millions of netizens.

---- Feb. 8, 1996 ---

Yahoo! has turned its pages black for 48 hours in support of the Coalition
to Stop Net
Censorship. Today, President Clinton signed legislation that includes a
provision which limits
freedom of expression on the Internet. With this act, the very same
materials which are legally
available today in book stores and libraries could be illegal if posted on
World Wide Web sites or
Usenet newsgroups. The Coalition to Stop Net Censorship is asking everyone,
everywhere to turn
their World Wide Web pages black until 11 a.m. EST on February 10 to show
just how many
people will be affected by this legislation.

Very good points! Just remember freedoms are very good when used, not 
exploited just as ones freedom to swing ones fist ends where another
person's nose begins...I still wouldn't want to make it too easy for
these spewers of hate.  If it was me making the rules, I would have 
all register like sex offenders then their propaganda can be monitored
if they cross over the line by proposing illegal activities, their 
assets can be seized just as they can and do when property is connected
to drugs...Once these groups have demonstrated a willingness to brake
the law or advise others to break the law then a judge in the jurisdiction
of the internet service provider COULD order a warrant or writ of 
examination, including a record of all e-mails and data transacted, thereby
having access to their root.  You could then determine who are the 
principals, lieutenants, soldiers along with the recruits and followers.
At this point we need a new surgeon generals warning to the rank and
file pointing out that following the path of hate could be dangerous to
their health and freedom as well as that of others, and that Johnny Law
would be watching.  

This could legally be done right now, with the possible exception of 
registration, these are extreme measures but these are extremists.  Once
their material is identified and documented we would have the ability
to do outreach, education and analysis of both their subtle and not so
techniques of recruitment.  I find everything about these disguting
low-lifes distasteful but will defend entirely their right to say it just
the same.

^^^^^^^^^^^By the way, no one can tell you whom you can like or not, 
that's the best thing about this country, YOU choose, you change the channel,
hit the 'D' Key or You Go Girl!  IMHO even bigots, racists, or whatever
variation has been put on this fine planet for a purpose...wonder what that
could be?  ?  ?  Could it be as the example to show the people how disgusting
this human weakness can manifest?  I saw Leaving Las Vegas and myself, I
enjoy a few beers though I was so grossed-out by the portrayal here it was
enough aversion therapy to make me temporarily want to quit, though I chose
to see the film, it would be controversial for government to be promoting
any kind of aversion though I'm sure a capitalistic angle could be found
for our wonderful sector of private enterprise, I wonder if they'd have
a market as an ASP (Aversion Service Provider) heh, heh, really I'm kidding
just kinda offering a little food for thought to all of us holier than thou,
more politicaly correct than the next bloke, liberals.

I recognize there's plenty of flame-bait in this post so if I've somehow
got you seething I'd love to receive any / all private e-mails on this or?
Though of course if I'm due for a more public flogging than spare no smiles,
my other cheek is churned <g>.

Peace & Love,
Daniel

Subject: Rave History
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

To anyone out there that is interested in exploring or sharing the history
of raves in the bay area, I've created a web page for the purpose.
I went through the sfrave archives and have started compiling some sets
of reviews of significant parties throughout the years.  I only have
a few up now (the gathering, basics, sunsets, wicked) but will do more
soon.  There is also a form so that people can submit personal stories
of their greatest moments or parties... You can also just mail submissions
directly to swoosh@he.net and I'll put them up.  Anonymous is fine...
most any topic that you find interesting is fine (the history of the music,
the lasers, the vibe, the whistle... whatever.)
It might be interesting to see what we can can make of it.

The address is:

http://www.he.net/~swoosh/raves/

thanks, and see you at Vision.

Hey, how about a new political party, 'Fun' <g>.  Could have conventions,
nominate canditates, swear allegiance to fun, hold "political" conventions
and everyone has fun! :) Yeah! Daniel

Sure it is.  Everyone likes to have fun!

Hasn't it occurred to you that implementing law & order is one of
the ways that *they* have fun?

Which is not much different than saying that many of our problems
are due to people who like to have fun in conflicting ways.

Yes, that is about as bad as someone saying that people in government
aren't interested in having fun.

I'm not sure either.  But generally speaking, things tend to evolve
toward their most natural state - so wherever we end up most likely
will be where we are meant to be, as we, like all things, continue to
travel with the currents of change.

Hey kids,

	I am back on sfraves after being off for a whole year while
I finished school in Los Angeles.  I'm back in the bay area now.

	The bowling party was pretty fun... We just kind of wandered around
doing random things.... throwin' balls, playing videogames, hanging
out in the bar (but not for too long, as it was pretty smokey).  It was
fun watching neat videos on the scoring screens.  We were even able
to pac-bowl in the alley itself... being sneaky like that makes you
feel so young!

	The sound system was the just the stock bowling alley system,
which was not very good.  Things that would really make pac-bowl
great is a decent sound system being used with the stock system...
it would be nice to have something setup in a designated dancing area.
No one was really dancing that much... which is too bad becuase the 
music was good.

sfraves run-ins:  Bryan C., Wayne.

I changed four words from Daniel's spiel, and look what happened.

This is why I do not believe in censorship.  Just like any deadly 
weapon, it can be turned on its owner.

[...]

"I still wouldn't want to make it too easy for these spewers of filth.
If it was me making the rules, I would have all homos register like
sex offenders then their propaganda can be monitored if they cross
over the line by proposing illegal activities, their assets can be
seized just as they can and do when property is connected to drugs..."

"Once these groups have demonstrated a willingness to brake the sodomy
laws or advise others to break the law then a judge in the
jurisdiction of the internet service provider COULD order a warrant or
writ of examination, including a record of all e-mails and data
transacted, thereby having access to their root.  You could then
determine who are the principals, lieutenants, soldiers along with the
recruits and followers.  At this point we need a new surgeon generals
warning to the rank and file pointing out that following the path of
sodomy could be dangerous to their health and freedom as well as that
of others, and that Johnny Law would be watching."

"This could legally be done right now, with the possible exception of
registration, these are extreme measures but these are extremists.
Once their material is identified and documented we would have the
ability to do outreach, education and analysis of both their subtle
and not so techniques of recruitment.  I find everything about these
disguting low-lifes distasteful but will defend entirely their right
to say it just the same."

Just a thought.

Anyone know how harmful the blacklights one finds at a party are?  I've 
been wondering this for sometime.  Some people tell me that the UV that 
causes stuff to flouresce is very bad for your eyes.  But, in my lab, we 
use black lights and the lower levels aren't supposed to be harmful.  
Anyone know anything about this?  

Thanks,
KC

Not to make light of your loss and hurt, but I'll say this again.
Not everyone does or should subscribe to anyone else's belief
system, especially revolving around music.  I really get tired of
the forced "spirituality" aspects of the techno & house appreciators
here in SF.  I don't want to take 15 minutes for a hand-holding circle
or a group hug or any rituals.  I will make my own meaning and significance
of the music.  This sort of "group think" about what the "Scene" should
or shouldn't be seems to limit individuals freedom to make it whatever
*they* want it to be.

Woa!  I can smell another explosive, emotionally-charged discussion
a-brewin' on this one...I can just see it: "So, does this mean that it's OK
for people to steal, if that's what they want to do?" sort of thing.  Of
course, it's NOT OK to steal, no matter what the reasons.  In a perfect
society, there would be no stealing, because there would be no possessions
("Who's perfect society?"...).  But, as Chrsitian Slater's character in
Heathers said, "The only place that people of different social types can
truly get along is in Heaven."  Believe it!  Let's tread lightly, eh?

Peace,

Subject: (NON-RAVE) A PC-SCSI Deal To Good To Pass..........
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Sorry to take up bandwidth with this; a reseller in Southern
California purchased a VERY large quantity of discontinued Fujitsu Model
#M2694EQA 1GB, Wide, Fast, Single Ended, 5400RPM, average 8.5ms seek time,
maximum data transfer rate of 20mb/sec burst, SCSI-2 Drives, & is selling
them at $249.00 non-reseller, & $199.00 reseller. My calculator tells me
that's about $0.25/mb, that's a fantastic deal!!!!! 

        I called Fujitsu, and they called the vendor with me via conference
call, to verify that this particular vendor is not selling the differential
version of this drive like some other vendors here in California are. The
differential version will not work with standard SCSI-1 or SCSI-2, without
the aid of a the extra cost of a bandwidth eating adapter.

        The model according to Fujitsu was just discontinued due to SCSI-3
eventually coming available/absolessance.

        I have technical specifications from Fujitsu via their fax back
service telephone #408-438-2620; request document #1305.

        The hard drive vendor is Bason Hard Drive Warehouse, telephone
number #800-238-4453, ask for Barry in sales.

         Note, I have no affiliation with this company, and I'm just passing
on what appears to be a great deal on to you all. Also, I can send this info
on to you as well just e-mail me.

TO: Robert/fixer please call me regarding the modem at cpu, thanks.......

Actually, you are wrong.  Many of us respect fixer's right to steal
from us as long as he respects our right to beat the living shit out 
of him after we come out of our group hug.

Right on. Let's be realistic, we're not all angels in this scene, in
fact I feel that in any scene which involves drugs, there will be people
around who are there for a quick profit. With that kind of attitude
you won't lose a night sleep over robbing people. On top of that,
I know of girls who sold themselves for E. It's not all about spirituality
and unity, I guess. Funny isn't it, it's not so different from the rest
of the world, one meets assholes and beautiful people.

And on another topic, raving in a bowling alley, that must be the weirdest
idea I have ever come across in this scene. One wonders what they will
come up next with, full moon parties at the golf course with day glo golf
balls?

Still pining of the green, green grass of home,

Yeah, I find that it's easier to love some people than to like them.  How
about this, then: those of us who promote kindness, let's commit ourselves
to caring for and looking out for each other.  That might help.  I also
hope more people will take all the joy and fellowship feelings with them
when they (we) leave parties and spread it out to the rest of the world.
I'm doing my part, and I love it!

Normally (as in, last week, the first week) there is an additional sound
system there. In fact, JK Sound's really nice EAW system was there but
there were problems getting it going for some reason last night.

Noone. Is "weird" (see below) that strong a judgement? I was more amazed by
the fact that actual bowling is going on during the party (if any, since
apparently few people danced). It is quite unusual wouldn't you say? Many
people still see raving as something different than going to bars, bowling

> if they want to rave on the moon, let them.

Sure, in fact, zero gravity would be a great idea. And I never stated one
shouldn't do this or that one place is better than another. I just thought
the idea was _funny_ (as did the "take the ravers bowling" posting, although
that didn't state it that obviously), not bad, immoral or whatever. In fact
I did suggest other possible locations like the golf course.

> if you don't want to go, don't.

Again, I never stated I hated it, I cannot even say that since I wasn't there.
Why such an aggressive reaction?

> "One wonders" indeed.

Sure... love, peace and respect, right? Don't take everything you read here
too seriously, you'll live longer. And wouldn't it be marvelous to get the
golf-playing-crowd raving? Might solve some world problems.

I went to the first one, and I found out that the trick is to boogie down 
the lane AS you throw the ball and knock over the pins...all in time to 
the music...but seriously I had a great time and enjoyed hearing my 
favorite music in a new kind of setting. I also thought that it was cool 
to have neat videos playing instead of scoreboards.

   For the past two weeks I haven't received one and I think it has to do 
   with my mail server doing maintenance stuff nightly...but who knows?  
   Certainly not me!  
   
   In any case, I tried to go to hyperreal.com on the web but there's the 
   48 hour blackout...so I'm kinda hoping I'll be up on what's going on 
   this weekend before our server gets more maintenance after 5pm this 
   weekend.  If you read this after 5pm Friday night, please disregard my 
   message.
   
   Thanks in advance and have a great weekend!

Hey all those of you who showed to #sfraves!  Thanks for coming!  As 
usual, there were the initial problems of getting onto servers that 
didn't have 10 minute lag between sentences, but things got rolling a 
little better after 9 pm.  I think for any future attempts (I keep 
learning as I go!) should probably be started a little later than 8 pm, 
as 8 pm is during the peak internet usage period & servers tend to be 
somewhat slower.  So I will probably not be starting them earlier than 
9 pm the next time I try this.

This time, we were actually able to get several people conversing at 
once!  Thanks to Brian Darkness, SDream, Bradley Graham, Starchild, 
djtom, & any others who may have shown while I was away for making it 
lots of fun!  What did we do?  We discussed deep meaningful 
philosophical idea, & found out many things:  sdream's pack of 13 
hamsters throw tiny secret rave parties while wearing little tiny 
raving outfits, Brian has a log-shaped cat (which of course dj's for 
the hamster raves), naked people rolling around in the mud are 
interesting, and they've all decided that I'm far into scatalogical 
humor.  Sounds really dumb & it was a total blast!  Much more 
successful than the last time.  It's really nice to get to actually 
talk to people you see on the list directly.  The irc is a very 
different environment than the list!  If anybody is interested I will 
definitely try this again.

Love,
Shawna

Thanks, Lee, for defending those of us in government who are interested in

        Hi everyone,

        just a few things (all rave-related even!), one is that i just
finished working on this zine thing and one part to it is an "info-e" flyer
that i had a chance to re-design for the zine. I .gif'ed it and put it up
on hyperreal, it's got a lot of good information in a tiny package. Ha ha,
i just thought of another metaphor for that line, *ahem* ;)
        please ignore my sense of humour and go to...

                http://hyperreal.com/drugs/infoe/index.html

        PLUS (tom you'll be interested in this) there's a couple cool goa
links that i found, one is at:
http://www.mrl.uiuc.edu/~menezes/goa/goaweb.html.

        there's also a main page at: http://www.algonet.se/~arfc/links.html

peace, and have a good friday night :)

I take extreme exception to this.  I'm not homosexual, but I would have to 
say you absolutely cannot equate homosexuality with pedophilia.  One 
involves consenting adults.  The other involves adults taking advantage of 
children, and yes, I absolutely believe that pedophilia should be illegal.  
To intimate that homosexuality has anything to do with pedophilia is ludicrous.

For those of you who are interested in getting tickets for the upcoming 
party, we will be at XNTRK tonight and Vision tomorrow, then on Monday 
we will be at MAD. Look for the people in the Crayon suits and that is 
us. Also, if you are not planning to go to these parties you can get 
tickets @ F-8 and Solid Grooves. 

Peace,


Greg :)

Pardon me?  So...what...would you throw the raves at the White House or 
simply advise the President on them?  I don't suppose the Oval Office was 
used as a chill room?  Was Hillary ever out of control while candyflipping? 
No, let me guess -- it was Al Gore on the keyboard?  Somehow, I just can't 
see Newt with an alien shirt on, but Ted Kennedy probably danced with his 
head in the speakers...

OH NO!  Now everyone knows!  More hamsters will start showing up, there will 
be wall to wall hamstas packed into the cage, the fire marshall will get 
wind of it, the police will have to break up the parties, and then, the 
deathknell: it'll go mainstream!  There will be hamsta raves everywhere, DJ 
LogCat's tapes will start showing up at Ameba!   Other cats will start DJing 
using DJ LogCat's style, with names like Cato, Carth, Kitty Kitty, and Doc 
Kitten.  Cage Music, CyberCage, TechnoCage, Goa Hammie, and Hammie Trance 
will be played on mainstream radio!   Industrial hamstas will gauge their 
coolness by the number of tail posts they've gotten.  The press will 
misreport that hamsters are dropping dead from taking tiny hits of e, but 
we'll all know it was dehydration because they boogied all night without 
ever hitting the water bottle.  School kids and yuppie-raver-wannabes with 
no sense of rhythm or vibe will be wearing hamsta wear!  It'll be horrible!  
Of course,  the true hardcore hamstas will just start having underground 
hamsta raves, staging them out in the forest or down on the beach, followed 
by after-parties with free sunflower seeds.  They'll post phone numbers on a 
hamsta rave calendar web page.  And of course, to communicate with other 
hamstas the world over, they'll start an email list, hamsta@hyperreal.com!  
The hamsta spirit will survive!

Hamstas Rule!

Exactly my point.  EVERYONE has a group in mind that they are absolutely
sure is completely, unregenerately evil, and that justifies such treatment.

For some, it's blacks.  For some, it's Jews.  For some, it's the anti-gun 
lobby.  For some, it's gays.  For some, it's Big Business (tm).  For some, 
it's Muslims.  For some, it's Christians, or Satanists, or Wiccans, or 
Native Americans, or lesbians, or drug users, or the UN, or the Krishnas, 
or environmentalists, or liberals, or whatever.

You are correct that you cannot equate any of these groups with each other.
But once you advocate censorship, covert monitoring, or depriving of life 
and liberty of any one of those groups, you have loaded the gun, and it 
can and will be turned on you as the fickle winds of public opinion change.

Remember COINTELPRO?  Bobby Seale?  Fred Hampton?  Judi Bari?  If not, 
maybe a little research is in order so you can actually see who gets it
when the government decides to covertly eliminate based on belief.

And if you persist in thinking "but X is different, those people really
_are_ evil", check the above list.  You're on it.  The world is full of 
people who do not share your views.

And just to play devil's advocate, the "age of consent" is 18 in most
places in the US.  Well through the middle ages, people were married
at 16 or less.  Most people reach (biological) sexual maturity much
earlier than that (13ish).  Sure, everyone can draw a line _somewhere_
and say "OK, that's disgusting, that's too much".  I can too, and do.
But others will draw the line both in front of and behind where I do,
and whatever my beliefs on the matter, I will not advocate censorship
for those advocating a different line.

Rape is another matter, and is a heinous act regardless of age, sex, 
race, or anything else.  Just so I'm clear here.  And if people want 
to start debating sexual politics, PLEASE take it private as this is 
well off topic already.  Plus I'm not very interested in the debate 
anyway, but it was brought up as an example so I responded to it.

Oh boy, another person unclear on the concept.

Nowhere in Robert's post was their any support of people stealing other 
people's stuff. What he was responding to was the fact that someone was 
saying "this isn't the way the "scene" is supposed to be, it is supposed 
to be this way...." Baaa.... baaaa... moo... moo...

Now,  THAT would be an interesting venue...  I guarentee that
there would NEVER be any noise complaints...  Sound don't travel
in a vacuum....   Perhaps someone might consider that as a MFR
site....  But with the low gravity,  I suspect that the BPM's

GHB (gammahydrobutylate) is an amino acid, a precursor to a protein.  It
metabolizes fat for you quickly and prevents it from being absorbed by your
body.  Body builders use it to tone up and lose fat right before contests.  GHB
can be incredibly interesting.  It can make you feel incredibly warm (in a good
way), slightly disoriented, and kind of liquidy.  Similar to e without the warm
fuzzies (it doesn't make you want to talk all night to the person standing next
to you in line for example)  In combination with e it is verrrrry nice; it
feels like it increases the peace within you.  HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT WITH
GHB, LESS IS MORE . . . MORE THAN ONE DOSE (one tablespoon) WILL MAKE YOU PASS
OUT AND THROW UP!  YOU WILL BE SO DISORIENTED THAT YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO WALK
ETC. Do not mix this with any alcohol!  The line between a good time with GHB
and a really bad time is VERY fine.  Make sure you stick to the tablespoon
rule, even if you are a larger person and smaller people should take smaller
dosages.  You can always take a little more, but you can't go back and take
less!

warmly,

Not to rain on anyone's bargain parade, but $250 or even $200 for a
1-gig drive just isn't a big deal.  I got a 1.6 gig new Maxtor IDE
drive at Egghead this week for just under $300.  Some of the specialty
remainder-stock (new in box but discontinued model) resellers like CSC
have had 3 gig Seagate SCSI drives for sale at $400 in the last month.
Drive prices have fallen dramatically and will probably continue to
decline somewhat.  

Now if you can find me fast, cheap, reliable RAM for, oh $20 a meg or
so, *that* would be something!

Actually, Pac Bowl is not really a new idea, there was at least one
similar event maybe two years ago, as I recall Jeno was on the DJ list
for that one.

It should become an honorable tradition, though.  I really want to see
the music spread to more than just the usual clubs, parties and outdoor
nooks and crannies.

        Hey all-Just a few ?'s about Vision tonight...I'm bartending and I
won't be getting off until at least 1:00 and probably later, so I was
wondering if  people think Vision will be sold out by then, or if there
will be a titanic line or anything like that.  Also, does anyone know how
much it costs after 11?  The recording says $15 with a can before 11, but
it doesn't say how much after.  Lastly, I'm coming from the city and I
heard there might be delays on the Bay Bridge.  Anyone got anything on
this?  Thanks for the help, hopefully I'll make it to the party.

Just got home from Vision where my friends were doing the light show with my
roommate's new LCD projector. I can't say that it was one of the better
parties that I've been to. . The first two DJ's, Tony and Grame, didn't
really do anything for me but Markie was THE SHIT. Definately the turning
point for the whole party! Thanks to Jondabomb@aol.com for finding something
we thought was lost.


Anyways, I've been up for 28 hours and it's time for a Newcastle and then to
bed!


ps: what did everybody think of the light show?

	Subject:	That Great Invertebrate
	From:   barlow@eff.org (John Perry Barlow)
	Date: 96-02-09 11:18:54 EST

Yesterday, that great invertebrate in the White House signed into the law
the Telecom "Reform" Act of 1996, while Tipper Gore took digital
photographs of the proceedings to be included in a book called "24 Hours in
Cyberspace."

I had also been asked to participate in the creation of this book by
writing something appropriate to the moment. Given the atrocity that this
legislation would seek to inflict on the Net, I decided it was as good a
time as any to dump some tea in the virtual harbor.

After all, the Telecom "Reform" Act, passed in the Senate with only 5
dissenting votes, makes it unlawful, and punishable by a $250,000 to say
"shit" online. Or, for that matter, to say any of the other 7 dirty words
prohibited in broadcast media. Or to discuss abortion openly. Or to talk
about any bodily function in any but the most clinical terms.

It attempts to place more restrictive constraints on the conversation in
Cyberspace than presently exist in the Senate cafeteria, where I have dined
and heard colorful indecencies spoken by United States senators on every
occasion I did.

This bill was enacted upon us by people who haven't the slightest idea who
we are or where our conversation is being conducted. It is, as my good
friend and Wired Editor Louis Rossetto put it, as though "the illiterate
could tell you what to read."

Well, fuck them.

Or, more to the point, let us now take our leave of them. They have
declared war on Cyberspace. Let us show them how cunning, baffling, and
powerful we can be in our own defense.

I have written something (with characteristic grandiosity) that I hope will
become one of many means to this end. If you find it useful, I hope you
will pass it on as widely as possible. You can leave my name off it if you
like, because I don't care about the credit. I really don't.

But I do hope this cry will echo across Cyberspace, changing and growing
and self-replicating, until it becomes a great shout equal to the idiocy
they have just inflicted upon us.

I give you...

A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace

Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I
come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask
you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have
no sovereignty where we gather.

We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address
you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always
speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally
independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral
right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true
reason to fear.

Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You
have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not
know us, nor do  you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your
borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public
construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows
itself through our collective actions.

You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you
create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our
ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order
than could be obtained by any of your impositions.

You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this
claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't
exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will
identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social
Contract . This governance will arise according to the conditions of our
world, not yours. Our world is different.

Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself,
arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications.  Ours is a
world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.

We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice
accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.

We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her
beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence
or conformity.

Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and
context do not apply to us. They are based on matter, There is no matter
here.

Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by
physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest,
and the commonweal, our governance will emerge . Our identities may be
distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our
constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope
we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis.  But we
cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.

In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications
Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams
of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These
dreams must now be born anew in us.

You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world
where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust
your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly
to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of
humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole,
the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes
from the air upon which wings beat.

In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States,
you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at
the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small
time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in
bit-bearing media.

Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate
themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own
speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be
another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world,
whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed
infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires
your factories to accomplish.

These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same
position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had
to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare
our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to
consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the
Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.

We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more
humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

Davos, Switzerland

ton of work to do....(Happy bodies need lots of water) I think I met Kristen.
I know I saw wayne there, and the crunchman.... There were so many friendly
people. I heard there was a fight, shame on those people!:) I thought the
lazers where totally intense, and the light show was really trippy.
Esspecially the trippy tv stuff, in the main room! Well I think my body has

Well I thought Vision was a very good party, even if it did require a
large amount of work and sweat to get through the whole thing. 
The music, sound, space, lights were all top notch. 

There was a great deal of tension that had been weighing me down
for a while, and I got to just get it all out and wrestle it down
to the floor, and towards morning my smile just got more and more
genuine, and my life just began to flow all the more.  I can't say
that it was all fun, but I can say that I'm feeling pretty damn good
today.  Sometimes you just have to pay your dues to see the shining sun.
So it was well worth it.

I missed this party (I'm holding out for Harmony next week) - so where 
was it located and did you like the space?  Was it a pretty big party?
I used to never ever miss a Basics, Gathering or Vision back in 93-94, 
but now I've found myself just loyal to Gatherings. I've been preferring 
the smaller venues with dj's I haven't heard yet.  But I still love 
hearing about these parties. 

love,
Amy

Yes...I agree that Markie got the place to move, but that DJ from 
Detroit kicked ass.  What was his name anyway?

I also thought the party wasn't the best I've been to.  The lights were 
right on (I like the big white one that flashes though, lasers don't do 
much for me).

Blake Baxter was the Detroit dj.  What did he play?  I got caught
up into some other commitments and missed this one...

Does trust qualify as a belief system? Regardless, I like being able to
throw my jacket in a corner and pick it up in the same place at the end of
the night. I don't know if I'd extend this trust to an expensive camera,
and I'll admit that my well-worn jacket is probably not the biggest
temptation around. I do know that I'd never think of doing the same at a
bar, a movie theater, or in a park. There absolutely is something about the
"scene" that allows us to transcend normal social barriers and interact in
ways that are substantially different from everyday life. Does this have
anything to do with the music that's being played? I've gone to lots of
concerts and clubs for the music, but felt no particular connection with
the other people there.

The rituals I've encountered have occured at the beginning or very end of
an event, so it never felt particularly forced; I could come a bit late or
leave a bit early. I agree that they often seem like a weird aside to the
rest of what's going on, but occaisionally I've found them pretty
interesting. The only really spiritual moments at raves for me have been
spontaneous, and have generally suprised the hell out of this
atheist-raised boy. Sometimes they've been shared with others at that
moment, sometimes not. In fact, I ultimately have no way of knowing whether
that person looking deep into my eyes was sharing anything like my
experience, or just getting off on the goofy expression on my face. I've
never been much of a herd-follower myself, so in the end it doesn't really
matter that much - the experience was quite real to me.

take care!
-nate

Can't tell you what he played cause I'm still new at this.  I just know 
that his music made me CRAZY!  I pushed my way to the front to watch him 
for a while.  The coolest was when he moved some knob back and forth to 
make the music cut in and out.  

I'd love to hear him again.  Does he usually play in SF?

Its been over a  month since i been out.  I had a great time though, 
didn't think it was as good as the gathering.  It was in the same big 
warehouse.  One room was used as a chill out room.  In there a tv was set 
up, with some people gathered around watching cartoons.  Behind that 
there was a big screen with some trippy patterns on it.  The room wasn't 
too comfortable, but it was nice to be able to chill out away from the 
music at times.
Started dancing  around 1am.  Not sure who the dj was, was but there was 
these bursts of high energy fast music, where the crowd would go crazy.
Some of markie's set I found interesting as he played alot of these 
percussion sounds.  It was at this point that I noticed people sitting 
down, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DANCE FLOOR.  Personally, I would prefer it if 
people wanted to chill out and rest they go to the chill room or along 
the  side, or at least toward the back.  As markie's music picked up, and 
people were jumping, I wouldn't have been surprized if the people on 
floor up front got stepped on.
Personally, I wasn't crazy about the detroit dj.  He really had me going 
at times, with a good groove but didn't seem to keep it that long, as he 
would change the tempo.  I chilled out to alot of his set, so I might 
have missed the best parts.  His music sounded like hard trance, a little 
too serious for my tastes for a long period of time.
I think I had the most fun dancing at the end to spun.  People were a bit 
spread out (would have prefered everyone to be a little closer), which 
left alot of room to dance.  This is nice allowing myself to dance with 
out concern of bumping anyone.  At this point it seemed that the people 
left were really into the music.  No one sitting down, people groovin, 
and taking in the remaining hour of happy music.  When it ended and 
lights came on, all I saw were smiles.
I thought the lighting was alot better than the gathering.  At the 
gathering the big room was mostly dark.  At vision there were some cool 
lazers, big screen video of some under water nature, and some cool 
looking animation stuff.
You might not tell from this post, but I did have a blast at vision.  And 
the drive home was something like going through a fantasy land, from 
driving under the new stucture before the toll booth to driving over the 
bridge.  The fog was so thick, I felt like I was driving in the heavens.  
Couldn't see the city until we were pretty close to it, and then we could 
only see the tops of the building peeking over the fog, with blue sky 
above it.

To my knowledge, Blake has never spun in SF before this.  But, coming
in the next few weeks are more Detroit dj's.

Feb 17  -Technotika (special guest dj's from Detroit are Rolando &
                     the Suburban Knight of Underground Resistance)

Mar 2  - (I forget the party name)  Derrick May & Stacey Pullen (and
                                    possibly Juan Atkins, if the promoter
				    wants.)

I thought the lights were fantastic.  I was wondering why the black lights
were turned off during the lasers?  Was it to see the lasers better? 
Anyway, it provided a neat mood change in the room. 

I had a great time and ended up staying much longer than planned:)

Not to be confused with Spundaes happy hardcore/Cyber Trance Goa room 
'teknotika'.  THe promoters got into over this one.  The argument?  
Teknotika has been an Underground Resistance record label fo many 
years.  Teknotika has been a happy hardcore/goa/cybertrance room at 
Spundae for awhile.

Who owns the name Teknotika?

A group of us went to XNTRK.  Our main pull was BIOJeff spinning, but we
were interested in hearing the other DJs, and checking out this new spot
south of Army Street.

Overall the party was good.  There were a couple hang-ups, a couple
glitches, but all-in-all it was a nice time.

The directions didn't get posted until late, like 9:30 PM and the party was
to start at 10PM.  It didn't matter too much because apparently the truck
bringing the sound system broke down, so that when we arrived at about ten,
there was no sound system up and we waited outside for an hour.  The crowd
kept building in that time and I guess it was a good thing the party was
ligitimate (I think the cops knew about it), for the crowd got pretty big
by the time they started letting people in.  There was a VERY heavy
shake-down at the door.  (I was told my sealed Odwalla shouldn't be let in,
but as long as I threw away the container he'd let me in with it.)  They
were very thorough in deed.

Forked over our $15 and entered through an open bar area and made a left
into a fairly sizable dance floor area.  Maybe a 25' X 25' hard wood dance
floor surrounded by a carpeted chill area, DJ was in front of us and there
was a large area for the DJs and there posses to chill in behind the
speakers.

Good sound and since everyone had been waiting outside there was an
immediate rush to the floor to shake out all that built-up frustration.
BIOJeff spun a great set of hard grooves and it was a great feeling to be
able to jump right into it.  He was undaunted by the fact that there was no
sound system when he arrived and that showed in his set; very seamless,
tight mixing from the start.

Upstairs was a sizable chill area that over looked the dance floor; tables
and chairs.  Restoration was still being done on the place, but it looked
nice and was clean.  I guess the doors to the women's bathroom didn't close
and that was mildly upsetting for the women.  Oh, the "club" from the
outside was labled as a Middle Eastern Restaurant, but it had more of a
club feel than a restaurant feel.  It was just off Army Street, east of the
101 by a couple blocks.  Forgot the name, and here we had been staring at
the neon signs for an hour.  So much for my long short-term memory, huh.

Simon followed BIOJeff and kept the place moving.  Donald Gluade followed
Simon and spun a wicked, groovy set.  The music wasn't exactly hard techno,
but it was pretty fast.  The crowd was at first a little tight, but thing
loosened up after a while.

Lights were good, Michael Clay's visuals were as good as always.  Two
screens.  Lasers.  Sound system held-up no problem.  Two sets of speakers
in front, two in back.  None upstairs.  Beers were $4 a piece!  Lots of
dancing throughout the night.  Lots of carpeted chill area throughout.
Security was present but very mellow.

All was going smoothly until about 5:30, or so.  From what we could see, it
appeared that the owner came in and asked for the party to end.  Lights
went on in the bar area and everyone sort of knew it was ending
prematurely.  We heard the party was to go until 8, but it got stopped at 6
(maybe because of the late start).  One DJ didn't get a chance to spin
(Markie) and it ended without ceremony.  Not even an encore song that I
really thought was needed for closure.  You know, abrupt ending of the
music is so sad and makes you feel that you didn't have a chance come down
from the rafters.

The promoters suggested that maybe we go to the End Up, but instead we
found ourselves floating in a hot bath.

As I said, it was a good party.

It looks as though Martin took the advice of those of us who posted
reviews of The Gathering last December. Vision had all the required
elements of a successful rave.

The same warehouse near the Oakland Colliseum that was used for The
Gathering was used again. I unfortunately arrived too late to take
advantage of the discount, but we dropped off our cans of food in the
bin, anyway. [I really like this trend of social awareness that Martin
is putting into his events.] The security line at around 11:00 was
nonexistent, and the guards searching us went about their business
quite casually and politely.

I was quite pleased and surprised to find *LASERS* in the main room.
They provided quite a cosmic effect, especially when mixed with the
smoke machines. The strategic placement of mirrors and disco balls
enhanced the effect. It was soooooo cool to raise my arms, and have the
laser light reflect off of them.

The vibe blasted off around midnight, with techo giving way to house in
the wee hours. The chill space (much larger this time than at The
Gathering) was carpeted, with a few mats around, and Walt Disney videos
playing on the TV screen. Large 1.5 l bottles of H2O were on sale,
which was really great for reducing the massive pileup of those 1.2 l
teasers. Plenty of fresh fruit was provided around 4-5am in the chill
space.

The only sfrave'er I ran into was Marty (great to see you again!). I
look forward to meeting many more of you at the next weekend massive.

   Stopped by Vanilla Fudge on Friday while hanging out with the very 
   Purple Tiger.  Vanilla Fudge is at Cafe Bastille, 55 Belden Alley in SF. 
   While it has a very tiny space for dancing (in the basement), it's 
   definitely a _crowded_ sweet spot to hang, listen to music, and have a 
   drink with some friends.  The thing I like about it is it's a regular 
   Saturday night gig that ends at 2am so people go there to socialize more 
   than to dance hard all night and go off.
   
   It's got a fine (mmmm-hmmmm) mix of folks w/alot of people who've been 
   around the scene for a while.  Someone thought it was more Euro but I 
   didn't necessarily feel that way.  I'd say it was similiar to the crowd 
   at Goldie's if any of you've gone to that club last year.  And if any of 
   you were there Saturday night, we were the glowstick purple freaks 
   dancing by the back stairs.
   
   Diana-bob gives it a thumbs up if you're looking for something very 
   crowded, musically pleasing, and social to do.  If I lived in SF I'd be 
   there alot more often.
   
   Cheers!

This was my first Vision, and my first party of the year!  The last one I
was at was The Gathering, and it was great to already know the location.  I
didn't know who was spinning at any given time, but there was plenty of
danceable music, just enough lighting to see all the happy faces, and
wonderful visual imagery all around.  The second room was quite empty, so I
stayed in the main room all night.  I was overwhelmed with all the love and
friendliness that people were sharing!  These three angel-girls invited me
over to say hi and dance, and they were all warm and loving.  I don't
recall their names, but they really made my night.  One of them gave me a
clip with a heart on it; very touching!  One of them, the slim brunette,
asked me to take my hair down from my customary ponytail, and I was so
happy to oblige, since wearing my hair down represents the real me.  They
all encouraged me to let my hair flow, and the slim brunette said that long
hair looks good on a guy.  They asked my age and couldn't believe that I am
30.  They said I seemed more like 20-25, which made me feel even better.
The slim brunette asked me for my address & phone number, and best times to
call.  I hope she calls, as I'm always interested in making new friends and
keeping the connections outside of parties.  I went to the party by myself,
and found many of "The Crew," my main party friends, so I felt more at
ease.  Another gal I met (again, can't recall the name) kissed me on the
cheek, and I told her that that was my first kiss of the year (true), so
she kissed me gently on the lips!  So much love...so many friendly
people...to everyone who was there, especially those I talked to, I love
you all and thank you.  People liked the red heart necklace I wore, and I
told them that it was my Valentine to everyone there.  I went outside at
one point to get some air with the angel-girls, and a guy came over to us
and told us that he and his friends loved us!  We went over to meet and
talk with them, and it was joyous.  After the party, some of us went to
Denny's for breakfast (bad call, although a nice way to relax).  Veronica
was absolutely stunningly beautiful, and her smiles shone brightly.  We
don't know each other, but we hugged as we were leaving Denny's.  All in
all, one of the better parties I've been to!

Thanks again, and peace!

I had a great time at this party - and I'm not exactly sure why -  but to
everyone who appreciated my pink and white flowered hat, thank you!

Got there early, - 11:30ish- and the vibe was happening already - great lights
and sound system - and though I didn't really hit my stride with the music until
Markie, I got dancing right away -

The Detroit dj was great (his beats reached right in and made me dance) and then
Spun's set was absolutely perfect (Jason, I didn't see you afterward to tell you
how much I liked it!) -- I spent most of these sets dancing up by the
turntables, what artistry --

Who was the last dj of the night?  He did a great job easing us back into
reality - 

I too thought it odd that people just plopped themselves and their stuff down in
the middle of the dance floor - but the room was so big, maybe sitting all the
way against the wall seemed way to far away?  Some big carpets would have been
nice too around the edges - the floor was pretty gross, but I didn't want to
trek over to the real chill space and miss the music.

And I must say it wasn't the friendliest crowd I've ever seen and I didn't see a
lot of familiar faces, maybe the darkness in the main room made the difference,
but there were some great dancers with great energy there, and I was thoroughly
happy to be there all night long!

The free=flowing water station was much appreciated and the profusion of
port-o-potties was great too! plus the fresh air from opening up the back doors
really keeps the air clean and cool.  Thanks!

Due to the amazing difference it made last week, we've decided to have JK 
bring in sound regularly to MAD. To balance out the cost of this, we're going 
to be charging $2 before 11pm now instead of $1. The cost after 11pm will 
remain $3. Let us know if you feel it's worth it... (we think so)

Tonight's lineup: Jon Santos, Solar, Ethan (Tony was originally scheduled 
tonight, but had to go down to LA to work on his next record)

10pm-2am, 18+ w/ID, @ Bahia Cabana 1600 Market @ Franklin.

Hope to see you all there!

Joe

I sent this msg hours ago, and never saw it -- so better redundant than lost
forever!

so....

Anybody got the word on parties going on this weekend in Seattle?  I'm going up
Thursday night, coming back Monday - and though I have lots of friends up there
who'll know what's happening, I want to make sure I build the good stuff into my
plans!

All information appreciated! Gracias.

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

This may be inappropriate for sfraves, but I wanted to follow up on a
recent message here (below) on GHB with another warning/clarification on
Gamma Hydroxy Butyrate (GHB) dosages.  The posting seems like a good
summary, but as noted, dosage is tricky and I was concerned about the
mention of one tablespoon as a starting dose.

I used GHB when it was available in health food stores (1990-91).  It was
sold mostly as a powder (sodium form?) about the texture of laundry
detergent.  The effective dosage (with variation by individual) for
powdered GHB is more like one TEASPOON, (NOT tablespoon!).

Greymarket GHB evidently is often sold in liquid form, either reconstituted
from powder or from suppliers that are not equipped to dry to powder.  I
would guess that the liquid doses would be more variable from source to
source (I don't know any) and require more than a teaspoon, but I would not
start at a tablespoon without personal experience from the same batch at a
lower dose.  May take more with e or acid or stimulants, but measure and
time doses (not less than an hour between) carefully or you may end up
passed out (and most likely just wake up ok some time later, but perhaps in
emergency room where you were sent by concerned friends).

        Also, there are dates set for Baltimore and Toronto in mid and late
march. Unfortunately they're nowhere near Montreal :( Both are excellent
PA's though, definitely reccomended :)

To think I will be 21 two weeks too late to see Jam & Spoon. AARRGGGGHH.
I would love to go to this if any of you could think of a way to get me 
in. I can give someone a ride/pay admission/whatever. Also, looking 
forward to Organic/Teknotika this weekend (haven't decided which yet) and 
Techno Temple in two weeks. Have a great week everyone!!!

Hello! I live in Reno, so if you need any help let me know. 

As for the raving aspect, the people who live in this area are really
anxious to go to a decent party, and as far as I know, we have all of the
required equipment. There are plenty of legal spaces and plenty of people
who would love to go. We're just lacking in the music department. 
So, if people volunteer to spin, let me know and I'll hook you up with 
the right people here. Let's see if we can make something happen! :)
Imagine. A sfrave in Tahoe. I'm grinning just thinking about it.

				        lv, Alex

George,

Looks like I missed saying bye!  I checked the space where we all were in 
the chill room...empty.  I ended up leaving about 7:30.  It was great to 
see everyone...especially you and Chris.  He's so funny!  I'll never 
forget that night at Sparky's!!  Tell him hello for me..Jerry too.

I'll definitely so you guys next time I'm in town.  Hope things are great 
with Jaime...I really liked her.

Marty

My old jacket has been left laying around somewhere or other at every rave
I've been to and never touched--until someone stole it at Area 51.  Got it

Greetings Friends!

As you may or may not know, we had tentatively scheduled our 2-year
anniversary party for February 24th. Unfortunately, we have been unable to
find a suitable space and are, therefore, postponing it until such time as
one manifests.

We are, however, going to do a free, daytime party outdoors in the east bay
on either Saturday, February 24th, or Saturday, March 1st, weather
permitting. We'll post details on this as soon as we have them.

take it easy
ethan

The following was sent to me by my college alumni group.  Thought that it
might provoke some thought among my raver brothers and sisters.

I really enjoyed Sting on Friday, and it seems that Mosaic was one phat partee!

Cheers to all.

I am looking forward to Harmony this weekend and wondered if anyone knows the
admission price.  I think I will be attending that party but I will definatly
be at Spundae's 3 year anniversary.  I am trying to decide which will be
better since I can only go to 1 (Organic or Harmony).  Any suggestions will
be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Thanks to those who sent me Seattle info and forwarded their club list -- if
anyone else is going to be there this weekend, let me know -- I'm planning to be
at Victor's Thursday, the Show Box Friday, Brasilia Saturday, and DEFINITELY at
MASTERS AT WORK on Sunday night!!  

Some of my friends are promoting the more club-oriented events, but if you'll be
out, or have other tips, I'd love to know and hear about it!

Keep SF rocking while I'm gone, please!  (Isn't it ironic, some of my Seattle
friends are coming down to SF this weekend)

Thanks and ciao, Leslie  : )

     Not sure if you guys remember, but right now I have a South African
exchange student staying with me for a couple of weeks, and I am trying to
show him a genuine SFRave.  I've got tickets lined up, but no way to get to
Harmony.  Any of you in Santa Cruz or possibly in San Jose that have 2 empty
spaces in your car would receive mounds of good karma for letting us fill
them (not to mention some gas money).  Any help at all is appreciated, even
some good advice on how to work the bay area public transportation ;').
 Thanks in advance,

Here is the text of the story, from the CNN Web Page:
http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/briefs/9602/02-14/index.html#4
There are also MDMA-related links on this story also:
----

LONDON (Reuter) -- Long-term use of Ecstasy, Europe's second most
popular "recreational" drug after cannabis, can destroy the liver and damage
the heart and brain, a study released Tuesday found.

The effects were clearly seen in young men in their early 20s, indicating
that the drug quickly causes widespread damage.

Forensic pathologists at Sheffield University said autopsies of seven youngmen
who had died after taking Ecstasy found "striking changes" in all their 
livers, including large areas of dead tissue.

Their hearts were also damaged, as were the brains of three of them. Doctors 
say the drug has killed at least 60 people in Britain.

----

Hmmm, what do you medical types out there think about this?  CNN gave
absolutely no specific clinical infomation about what actually happened to 
these people.

Happy Valentine's Day everyone!

For most of us, we experience the "Valentine's Day spirit" often when we dance
and party together --  but not everyone is as fortunate as we are... there are
lots of people in our world who don't feel loved and like they belong --

So my pledge for today is to remember the spirit of sharing love with everyone I
meet today - I know there are a whole lot of us out there who don't have a
specific "sweetie" to give us flowers, cards, smiles and Valentine's vibes --
but that doesn't mean we can't share a little "love" with the people we meet --
our friends, family and even (maybe especially) strangers.

And for all of you amazing SFRavers, who are so different from each other, but
with the common bond of music and the raving spirit --  have an awesome day!

Love and hugs -- Leslie  xxx  : )   000

P.S.  That post about the summary of the world, if there were only 100 people
there, was mind-blowing, was it not?

Well, I'll be attending Harmony.  The dj lineup looks amazing, it's only 
$10, and Harmony parties have the reputation of having great vibes.  
Tickets are presale only, though, and I don't know the status on them.

love,
Amy

Oh well, I guess since nodoby's buying Levis anymore (remember in the 80's
Levis were THE SHIT-everyone had them) they're trying to appeal to "GenX"
to gain some market share lost to all the companies that make baggy style
jeans.  This is just another corporate-kiss-of-death to this scene.  As
Miss Fabio Jones put it once- we are a market not a movement (to those in
power and with the cash)  Sorry to sound negative , this is after all just
my opinion.

	When I was in London over Xmas, Levis was running the
	MOST flipped out advert on TV that I've ever seen!
	It had this totally wacked little rave ditty running
	(Spaceman!  Spaceman!) over the visuals - which were
	of some space babe returning home to her super 50's
	retro-futurismo cyberban neighborhood after borrowing
	the keys to Dad's space ship.  The song "Spaceman"
	by Babylon Zoo went to #1 in the UK the week it was
	released......

	For some reason, Levis is NOT going to show the ad
	in the US!  :-(

BY YOUR COMMAND:

        First, Happy V-Day to all; ya know birth is hard, life can be
painful, and death is just plain mean; make sure you get yourselfs some love
in between.

        Ok, regarding change......something I'm told be can be asured of in
our world. Well, I'm no exception, for the Brian DarknEs^2
<brianvan@mail.liberty.com> will be no more shortly. This change is
necessary for a number of reasons, one of them being technological
advancement, and a number of personal reasons.

        Every 4 - 5 years I upgrade my entire system, well. it's that time
again, with the added addition of going ISDN, my own site with dedicated
IP(very cheap shell accounts available soon, as well as speed & processing
power for hire) different OS; possibly even multithread.

        What this means to you, you will not see my handle Brian DarknEs^2
anymore, as well as my e-mail address because everything will be different,
however I will still be a member of this list just under another disclosed
to some, undisclosed to many address & site.

        However, I will be infrequently checking my liberty account if you
miss getting in touch with me.

        I've been a very vocal presence on this list for about a year and a
half, and I will miss corresponding with most of you. I would like to envite
anyone who feels they have unfinished bussiness with me to do it now before
I go off in about 10 days or so.

        Peace & Love always, and despite my occasion & yet very human
incidences of disharmony with myself reflected onto others. Farewell.........
        
<<<<<<<<<<<<IF YOUR NOT A TECH HEAD STOP HERE>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

        The new system will look like this so far:

         Tyan Tempest PCI/EISA/ISA Dual P-166 512k pipeline cache, AMIWIN
BIOS with 32megs of RAM to start. A cohabitated hard drive subsystem
consisting of 2 gigs of SCSI 2 Wide Fast Drives controlled by an Adaptec
AHA-2940UW PCI Ultra Wide SCSI 3 controller & 1gig of ESDI drives controlled
by an Ultrastor 22CA EISA controller with 16megs of cache. NEC 6xi SCSI
internal CD-ROM, Motorola Bit Surfer Pro ISDN Modem,   Motorola Lifestsytle
28.8 fax modem & a 17" monitor, either NEC or significant other.

        Can you say speed.

        With regard to the following items I'm looking for advice:

Video/Graphics:

        I want to be able to do hardware M & JPEG, for Full Screen/Motion
Video playback. I've also been looking at True Vision stuff for awhile, very
expensive though, but I would get multi video in, as well as mixing capability.

        Picks so far.

#9 Imagenation 128bit PCI  2 - 4 meg VRAM

True Vision 16 

Sound:

SB AWE-32 Full edition, addition welcome.

how's Turtle Beach & is it supported

Hi all, I may not be subbed yet when you get this message, but my name is 
Jason and I'm currently on the NW-Raves list and will be coming to the Bay 
area soon. I was wondering if someone could send me a list of all of the 
record stores in the area, SF, Berkeley, etc. I'll probably be spending about 
a month there and if I can get settled, maybe longer. I have heard nothing but 
good things about the parties in SF and have never had anything but wonderful 
visits.

Thanks,
Jason

At Harmony's second anniversary, I brought homemade banana bread to share,
and thought that I would bring it to all future Harmony parties.  Well, I
wasn't on the ball this time, and don't have bananas rotting in my kitchen
like I should.  Instead, I'll bring lots of love.  Hope that's OK!:)  Maybe
next time...

Rock 'n' rave!

As far as I know, Levi's is the only company to have a television ad
featuring an squirty, acidic tb303 line.

This is to the 3 people who responded to my question about Born Slippy.
 Thank you for the info, sorry I don't remember who you were but since AOL
has reactivated the Delete key I have been delete happy and lost all my
letters.  So I got dubnobasswithmyheadman and it's really spiffy, I can't
stop listening to it.  I' m gonna have to look harder for the Born Slippy
single I guess.

p.s. there is an article on underworld in the new Details, kinda short but
slightly informative.

Yeah, it may be fun... but correct me if I am wrong... haven't the
last 1 or 2 technostates been busted?  I would make sure that
this one is in a secure location before treking down south.  Oh,
if you have been reading socal-raves, you will see that big parties
have been having a big problem with busts as of late...

Boy, is it ever.  I have several pairs of Levis, 501s and 505s.  Sorry bud, 
but Levis are like tuxedos -- fads come and go, but what looks good lives 
forever.  Levis are about the only jean you can wear into the corporate 
world and look presentable -- it's called "business casual".  I have yet to 
see a set of baggies in my office, but 501s and 505s are every day wear, 
whether paired up with a t-shirt or a button down with a stylin tie.  That's 
not to say I'd wear them to a rave, but then the clothes most people wear 
out are dictated by fashion.

Of course, this is just my opinion....

Diamonds
They're forever, loves
Well, that's what I've been told
By a lonely man on the radio
But he hasn't got me souled

See, forever, that's real long in deed
And diamonds are surely not
But nor is chocolate  or money  or greed
And all these silly toys we've got

I think i'll choose a wiser investment
To get more on my return!
And I'll be sure to share with all
The riches that I've earned

So when shopping for your special love
Don't forget it's actual worth
And remember that forever
Goes far beyond this earth

My valentine goes to that radio man
On this day of love
And all who think diamonds and chocolates
Are what this day is of

Here is the text of the story, from the CNN Web Page:
http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/briefs/9602/02-14/index.html#4
There are also MDMA-related links on this story also:
----

LONDON (Reuter) -- Long-term use of Ecstasy, Europe's second most
popular "recreational" drug after cannabis, can destroy the liver and damage
the heart and brain, a study released Tuesday found.

The effects were clearly seen in young men in their early 20s, indicating
that the drug quickly causes widespread damage.

Forensic pathologists at Sheffield University said autopsies of seven youngmen
who had died after taking Ecstasy found "striking changes" in all their 
livers, including large areas of dead tissue.

Their hearts were also damaged, as were the brains of three of them. Doctors 
say the drug has killed at least 60 people in Britain.

----

Hmmm, what do you medical types out there think about this?  CNN gave
absolutely no specific clinical infomation about what actually happened to 
these people.

I always take clinical studies with a grain of salt.  There's no way to
have truly conclusive proof of causation when there are so many variables.
Although I think the press is a little overanxious to prove that MDMA is
dangerous and deadly, it's imprtant to remember it's not exactly healthy
either...

I'd go through the whole article and point out what's wrong with the study,
but hyperreal's resident drug expert seems to have beat me to it..  :)

(the following is pretty long.. sorry about that)

consistant with heatstroke in 6 of the cases:

``The pathology of heatstroke has been reported in a number of papers.
In the liver the most striking change is centrilobular necrosis.
Sinusoidal congestion and dilatation, and portal and sinusoidal
inflammation may be present. Fatty change has been reported occasionally.
Cholestasis may be present, especially in fatal cases. Rubel and Ishak34
did not find liver necrosis as frequently as other authors. They examined
the liver in 50 military recruits who had died of heatstroke. These men
were predominantly white. Kew et a131 had found liver necrosis a common
finding in black South African gold miners. The difference in frequency
may be related to the fact that the gold miners work in very high
environmental temperatures with over 90% humidity, con-ditions not
dissimilar to some raves and discos.''

and in the other case with jaundice it was consistant with an ideosyncratic
reaction to MDMA:

``In the seventh case death was caused by fulminant liver failure and
although hyperpyrexia may have been present at some time.  In the seventh
case death was caused by fulminant liver failure and postmortem examination
revealed massive hepatic necrosis. All investigations for the cause of
liver failure were negative. The young man admitted to regular and heavy
ecstasy use, and this case is similar to cases described by Henry et al.7
There is increasing evidence that "ecstasy" is hepatotoxic, and liver
changes have been re-ported following biopsy. 10 55
   ``These changes, however, differed from those found in the acute deaths
described above. Whether the damage is caused by an idiosyncratic reaction to
MDMA, or a contaminant of the drug is unclear. Therefore, there seems to
be a second mechanism for liver injury from ring substituted
amphetamines unrelated to hyperthermia. [...] Individual susceptibility
to ring substituted amphetamines may be related to its metabolism
in the liver. Abnormalities have been reported in demethylation in
susceptible individuals, related to human debrisoquine hydroxylase
(CYP2D6).38''

``The brain of one of the cases of rapid death showed disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), oedema and degeneration of neurones,
particularly apparent in the locus ceruleus. Two cases showed foci of
haemorrhage (fig 4). One case showed severe cerebral oedema consistent
with water intoxication and had additional occasional perivascular
haemorrhages.''

This is acute brain damage as a result of a medical crisis (perhaps
not MDMA-induced heatstroke in all cases) and not the result of
5-HT neurotoxicity.  Similarly the internal bleeding in the lungs
is another symptom of an acute crisis.

The only thing I don't know about is the myocardial damage.  They state
that it was consistant with catecholamine induced myocardial
injury, but i don't know how severe of a risk this is.  They also
state that:

``[WRT heat stroke] In the myocardium contraction band necrosis and small
foci of necrosis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate are seen. These
features are also evident in catecholamine induced injury. In the brain
ring haemorrhages and hypoxic changes have been described. The kidneys
may show acute tubular necrosis and pulmonary haemorrhage is common.''

This doesn't really say anything new about MDMA risk-assessment, though.
It just means that in the cases of deaths due to MDMA, we may not know
exactly what is going on and it may not be as simple as "MDMA-induced
heat stroke."  Interesting from the point of view of finding out what
is going on when people die from MDMA, but not that interesting otherwise...

(Oh, I guess interesting if someone still believed that it took heat
+ dehydration to produce MDMA DIC+Co., but you convinced me that MDMA
could do this in the presence of precautions against overheating and
dehydration some time ago...)

The heart, yes that kinda concerns me, and I need to do more research to
figure out exactly what the heck they're talking about.  I don't think
that they've got a whole lot of evidence for any long-term effects on the
brain and liver, though.

Some silly-ass net-based "news" service in the UK has published a report
claiming that based on this article the kid who is drifting in and out of a
coma may have brain damage.  Really idiotic to base "possible" brain damage
on these findings when I'm certain the kid's doctors have run a CAT scan
on him (or something similar) and would know if he was having brain
hemmorages or not.

Here's the text of the _JCP_ paper in question.  I don't have the tables,
pictures, or references and the thing may not be formatted correctly since
it was in pretty bad shape when I got ahold of it.

Reproduced without the permission of _JCP_, but I *have* given you all
notice that you shouldn't necessarily trust this to be an accurate
reproduction, and I think there's enough sections of this paper missing,
that no one is going to pass up the real article in _JCP_ just for this.
(I certainly can't imagine any medical libraries cancelling thier
subscription to _JCP_ thinking they can now just get it over the
Internet...).  So, go out and subscribe to _JCP_ right now, or go to
your medical library and write them a note about how you either
would really appriciate them carrying it or do really appreciate them
carrying it...

And don't reproduce this article without attatching these three paragraphs,
so that _JCP_ doesn't get a bad name if I fucked something up...

Pathology of deaths associated with "ecstasy" and "eve" misuse

C M Milroy, J C Clark, A R W Forrest


Abstract

Aims- To study the postmortem pathology associated with ring substituted
amphetamine (amphetamine derivatives) misuse.
Methods- The postmortem findings in deaths associated with the ring
substituted amphetamines 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA,
ecstasy) and 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA, eve) were studied
in seven young white men aged between 20 and 2 5 years.
Results- Striking changes were identified in the liver, which varied from
foci of individual cell necrosis to centrilobular necrosis. In one case
there was massive hepatic necrosis. Changes consistent with catecholamine
induced myocardial damage were seen in five cases. In the brain
perivascular haemorrhagic and hypoxic changes were identified in four
cases. Overall, the changes in four cases were the same as those reported
in heat stroke, although only two cases had a documented history of
hyperthermia.  Of these four cases, all had changes in their liver, three
had changes in their brains, and three in their heart. Of the other three
cases, one man died of fulminant liver failure, one of water intoxication
and one probably from a cardiac arrhythmia associated with myocardial
fibrosis.
Conclusions- These data suggest that there is more than one mechanism of
damage in ring substituted amphetamine misuse, injury being caused by
hyperthermia in some cases, but with ring substituted amphetamines also
possibly having a toxic effect on the liver and other organs in the
absence of hyperthermia. (J Clin Pathol 1996,49(2):149-153)

Keywords:       eve, ecstasy, postmortem pathology.


Recreational use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA), more
commonly known as "ecstasy" (and a variety of other names including "XTC",
~ or "E"), is now well established. In Britain upwards of 500 000 people
are said to use the drug each week (Harris Poll (1992) for "Reportage",
BBC2, 22 Jan 1993).

MDMA is a ring substituted amphetamine with psychoactive properties. First
synthesised in 1914 from methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), itself a drug of
misuse (known as the "love drug"), it has been used in psychotherapy and
was originally used as an appetite suppressant. The drug has ceased to be
used medicinally and is now an established part of the illegal drug scene.
It is banned in most countries. In the UK it is a class A drug as defined
in Schedule 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. It has no medicinal use in
the UK and cannot be prescribed.

As well as MDA and MDMA, another variant, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine
(MDEA, known as "eve"), which is similarly proscribed, is commonly
encountered. All have similar pharmacological effects.  In the UK, MDMA is
often taken by young people at discos and rave parties.  Both involve
dancing, but especially at the latter there is vigorous repetitive dancing
in crowded rooms with a hot and humid atmosphere. The dangers of this
activity are recognised to a certain extent as rooms to "chill out" are
often available for people to rest in after periods of exertion. Toxic
effects and the occasional death following ring substituted amphetamine
misuse have been reported but postmortem data are lacking.  1-26 In this
paper we report on deaths associated with ring substituted amphetamine
misuse and detail the postmortem findings.


Methods

Seven deaths have been investigated by the University of Sheffield
Department of Forensic Pathology in the past three years, which were
associated with ring substituted amphetamine misuse. One case has been
reported previously.26 Case details are presented in table 1. All of the
subjects were white men, between 20 and 25 years of age. Three of the
victims collapsed at a rave or disco, two were found in bed, one in a
collapsed state and one dead, one collapsed in the street, and one was
admitted to hospital with progressive jaundice.

Only two of the men had documented hyperthermia, with temperatures of 440C
and 39~50C. One of the deaths was thought to have been caused by water
intoxication, the victim having drunk an estimated 14 litres of water in
trying to quench the thirst that is frequently associated with ingestion
of ring substituted amphetamines. None of the men were known intravenous
drug abusers.

Full drug screening was performed on body fluids, including a screen for
drugs of abuse. Screening by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy was also
performed.


Results
PATHOLOGY

The pathologlcal and toxlcological data are summarised in table 1.

Liver

The liver showed dramatic changes. Necrosis was seen in all cases. In one
case there was centrilobular and midzonal necrosis (fig 1). This patient
survived for four days. In the other cases focal necrosis in zone 3 was
present, with an acute inflammatory response surrounding necrotic
hepatocytes (fig 2). Fatty change, sinusoidal dilatation and inflammation
were also identified. No other hepatic pathology was identified in these
cases. Postmortem virology was not done in these cases. In case 7 there
was massive hepatic necrosis, with the liver only weighing 795 g at
necropsy. Full viral screening was negative in this case. The livers were
of normal size in the other cases.

Heart

Changes were seen in five of the seven hearts examined. Histologically,
the changes ranged from contraction band necrosis to individual myocyte
necrosis with a surrounding neutrophil and macrophage inflammatory
response; the same changes as have been described in catecholamine induced
myocardial injury (fig 3). In one case foci of fibrosis were identified in
the heart of a man in whom traces of MDMA and MDA were found in the urine.


Brain

The brain of one of the cases of rapid death showed disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), oedema and degeneration of neurones,
particularly apparent in the locus ceruleus. Two cases showed foci of
haemorrhage (fig 4). One case showed severe cerebral oedema consistent
with water intoxication and had additional occasional perivascular
haemorrhages.

Other organs

Pulmonary infarction was seen in case 5. In two of the other rapid deaths
intra-alveolar haemorrhage was present. In one case there was inhalation
of gastric contents. In the patient who died of water intoxication there
was complete necrosis of the pituitary gland. Severe cerebral oedema was
present and the pituitary necrosis was probably a direct consequence of
this as the blood supply was compromised. In two cases the kidneys were
examined for myoglobin, which was not detected. No skeletal muscle damage
was identified.


TOXICOLOGY

The toxicological data are shown in table 1. MDMA was found in five cases,
varying from trace concentrations to 4~2 mg/l. MDEA was found in two
cases, at concentrations of 3.5 and 0~187 mg/l. Amphetamines were detected
in three cases at concentrations of 0~256, 0~453 and 1~4 mg/l.  MDA was
found in three cases, varying from trace concentrations to 8~5 mg/l. MDA
is a metabolite of MDMA and MDEA, but may also be found as a constituent
of "ecstasy" tablets, along with other pharmacological substances
including amphetamines (vide infra). No opiates or other drugs associated
with intravenous drug abuse were detected.


Discussion

Ring substituted amphetamines (amphetamine derivatives) are taken because
they give a feeling of euphoria and benevolence and heighten the
sensations at raves and discos. However, when 29 volunteers took MDMA, as
well as pleasant symptoms, all complained of undesirable effects which
included loss of appetite, trismus and bruxism, nausea, muscle aches,
stiffness, and ataxia.27 Sweating, tachycardia and hypertension, insomnia,
and fatigue were also reported. More serious complications reported
include hyperthermia, convulsions, other cardiac arrhythmias,
rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure,
hyponatraemia, hepatoxicity, pneumomediastinum, aplastic anaemia, cerebral
infarction, cerebral haemorrhage, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. 1
26

In five of the cases reported here complications followed shortly after
ingestion. Four of these deaths seem to be linked directly to the toxic
effects of MDMA and MDEA. In the fifth case there was evidence of water
intoxication, which followed the taking of "ecstasy". In this case,
however, myocardial and liver pathology was identified which was similar
to the other cases. The sixth case collapsed in the street. Myocardial
fibrosis and foci of liver necrosis were identified and toxicology
revealed traces of MDMA.

MDMA is believed to act on at least three neurotransmitter pathways, as
does cocaine, but with MDMA the serotoninergic (5-hydroxy-tryptamine)
pathway is principally affected, which would account for the more
pronounced effect on mood. Cocaine acts chiefly on the dopaminergic
system, which accounts for its greater addictive properties.  MDMA also
acts on the noradrenergic system. Serotonin plays a major role in
thermoregulation and interference with this mechanism is believed to be
the cause of the hyperthermia which arises as a complication of ring
substituted amphetamine misuse. Stimulation of the noradrenergic system
also probably contributes to hyperthermia.

Hyperthermia may account for many of the changes seen in deaths from ring
substituted amphetamine misuse, although it is interesting to note that
raised temperatures were only documented in two of our cases.  The
pathology of heatstroke has been reported in a number of papers. In the
liver the most striking change is centrilobular necrosis. Sinusoidal
congestion and dilatation, and portal and sinusoidal inflammation may be
present. Fatty change has been reported occasionally. Cholestasis may be
present, especially in fatal cases. Rubel and Ishak34 did not find liver
necrosis as frequently as other authors. They examined the liver in 50
military recruits who had died of heatstroke. These men were predominantly
white. Kew et a131 had found liver necrosis a common finding in black
South African gold miners. The difference in frequency may be related to
the fact that the gold miners work in very high environmental temperatures
with over 90% humidity, conditions not dissimilar to some raves and
discos. In the myocardium contraction band necrosis and small foci of
necrosis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate are seen. These features are
also evident in catecholamine induced injury. In the brain ring
haemorrhages and hypoxic changes have been described. The kidneys may show
acute tubular necrosis and pulmonary haemorrhage is common.

The mechanism of damage in heatstroke is postulated to be caused by
circulatory collapse and hypoxic damage, possibly combined with
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, which has been recorded in
heatstroke,3637 and as a complication of MDMA and amphetamine ingestion.37
In the myocardium the damage may be related to catecholamine induced
injury. These myocardial changes are also seen secondary to brain
pathology, and contraction band necrosis may be seen in resuscitation,
especially when catecholamines are used. Whilst these are alternative
explanations for the changes seen, not everyone was resuscitated, and the
myocardial changes are frequently seen, even in early deaths.

The pathological changes present in these deaths are the same as those
seen in deaths from heatstroke. These changes provide further evidence
that hyperthermia can cause death following misuse of ring substituted
amphetamines. Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was also
present in the brain. These deaths may therefore be a complication of
hyperthermia, DIC and shock. Some caution must be exercised, however, in
ascribing a death from ring substituted amphetamine misuse to these
mechanisms as a high temperature is not recorded in all cases, although
hyperpyrexia may have been present at some time.  In the seventh case
death was caused by fulminant liver failure and postmortem examination
revealed massive hepatic necrosis. All investigations for the cause of
liver failure were negative. The young man admitted to regular and heavy
ecstasy use, and this case is similar to cases described by Henry et al.7
There is increasing evidence that "ecstasy" is hepatotoxic, and liver
changes have been reported following biopsy. 10 55

These changes, however, differed from those found in the acute deaths
described above. Whether the damage is caused by an idiosyncratic reaction
to MDMA, or a contaminant of the drug is unclear. Therefore, there seems
to be a second mechanism for liver injury from ring substituted
amphetamines unrelated to hyperthermia. Furthermore, the possibility that
the myocardium may also be damaged by these drugs without documented
hyperthermia is suggested by case 6 and other reports, where myocardial
fibrosis has been reported following misuse of MDMA.3 Individual
susceptibility to ring substituted amphetamines may be related to its
metabolism in the liver. Abnormalities have been reported in demethylation
in susceptible individuals, related to human debrisoquine hydroxylase
(CYP2D6).38 Another problem for the recreational drug taker is the quality
of the tablets they take. Examination of "ecstasy" tablets by one of the
authors (ARWF) has shown that the contents of the tablets vary greatly,
and may be a mixture of MDA, MDMA, MDEA, amphetamines, or no
pharmacologically active substance; compounds such as potassium chlorate
may also be found (table 2). With such material the possibility of toxic
contaminants being present is evident.

The short term risks of "ecstasy" use are becoming increasingly more
apparent and questions must be asked about the long term effects on the
brain, liver and heart considering the pathology found in those who die.

OK, this is my dilema :

A friend's  ((who I don't see often enough as it is)) plans to drive down 
from Redding, pick me up in the city, and then trek unto Harmony has 
fallen through. Normally, getting to a party in the city or even the east 
bay really isn't all that difficult for anyone willing to put in some 
time on public transportation, but a trip down to Santa Cruz & back is 
asking a lot, which is exaclly what I'm doing. I have an extra ticket, 
gas money, & gatorade to offer in exchange for space or a trunk. If you 
think that sounds like a fair deal I want to hear from you. If not it 
looks like I'm stuck with 2 tickets. Thanks for hearing me out -

Hello,


I have 1 1200 and will hopefully be getting another one in the near 
future.  I was wondering what people would suggest for 
cartriges/needles?  I don't know much in this department but figure I 
should get a fresh matching pair.  Also include the relative prices I 
should be paying for a pair.  Thanks a million.

I like Stanton 680 cartriges, with the stanton needle that goes with them.
You can get two cartriges with needles for $99 as a package deal.

Count me in as among the Levi's faithful.

I've worn many different brands of jeans in my past and present,
including Sears (yuck!), Wrangler, Lee, Calvin Klein, Blue Zone, and
Levi's. I always seem to come back to buying Levi's, especially the
501's, 505's, and the Silvertab. They fit better on me, and they wear
much longer than the others. My favorite rave wear includes a solid
black pair of Levi's 505's.

George

P.S. Has anyone seen that "rave" Levis commercial, with the slogan,
"Reason #000: Be your own reason," and the swirling graphics
surrounding the "501"? I saw it right after attending The Gathering
last year -- it simply blew my mind away.

Whoa, hold on a sec....
I was told that this party was going to be in *San Francisco*.  Coming 
from Sacramento to Santa Cruz is an especially long drive that I do not 
want to make.  Does anyone here know where it is supposed to be for sure?

No, Harmony is in San Francisco!  So I've been told & so says the 
Harmony voicemail recorder.  Don't worry!

Hey all!

A few things:

1st off, gotta do my usual thing & post my description so that y'all 
can hunt me down & say hello at Harmony!  Am very much looking forward 
to it, & please come & say hi!  Anyway, I'll be pretty distinctive, 
I'll be wearing my black converse hightops, my hot pink tye-dye 
leggings, my purple SFRaves t-shirt, and a bright pink feather boa!  
And I'll also be carrying around a bag full of happy trip-toys to play 
with, I should be easy to spot, so come up & say howdy!  Oh yeah, 5'8", 
shoulder length straightish brown hair.  Any descriptions of you all 
who are going so I can keep an eye out for you too?

Also:  Just wanted to double-check this, the Harmony voicemail says 
that the pre-sale ticket I just bought is merely a ticket to the map 
point, where I will then have to get the actual admission ticket.  I 
did hear this correctly, right?  I just wanted to make sure of this, 
cause it was enough of a pain in the butt driving all the way out to 
F-8 from the Concord area, that I'd rather not have to make additional 
treks out aside from directly to the party if I don't have to.  And if 
it is so that this is just a ticket to the map point, can I assume the 
directions to the map point will be posted on the Harmony voicemail 
recording?  Or was I stupid in forgetting to ask about that at F-8?

Thirdly:  I'll be wearing my sfraves laminate to Packa-bowl tonight, 
hope to see anybody who's going there!

Love,
Shawna

Planet was aired during an episode of the Simpsons here in the US. However, 
I haven't seen it since on air. There is a copy  of it on the site:
http://www.levi.com/inner-seam/eu/vol1/iss2/


FYI, Babylon Zoo is a "doggy-indy" band and not techno 
related. Also any band that has done a 
soundtrack for a Levi's EU commercial has always hit #1 in the charts. 

Also check out next week's ad that is coming out in the Inner-Seam section.
The soundtrack is by MC 500ft. Jesus and this commercial will definiately
*NOT* be on air in the US.

is definitely in SF.

And I've gotta say that they have a great website, including some of the
best electronic valentines I've ever encountered.  I love my Silvertabs
(have a pair on now), and they are a fairly progressive company, despite the

This list is now being generated from a 'database' - i'm still testing
my program and tweaking it, so there may be a few mistakes this time.
There's a link on the SFR home page (http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/sf)
to test the live generation of the calendar.  Let me know if you
see any problems (besides the punctuation problems I can already see).
This mechanism will allow for web-based searches for particular types
of events (when I get around to setting that up).

This weekend, Harmony and Organic and Teknotika face off - Harmony 
should be a bit more intimate, and conversely, Organic will be more massive,
while Teknotika is the obvious choice for Detroit fans.  On Sunday,
Spundae has little competition for their big show.

I'll join in then as well.  For those few of you sfravers who haven't met 
me yet, I'll most likely be wearing a white Hanes tee shirt and dark 
green cords.  I'll be sporting my sfraves laminate, too.  I'm 5'6" with 
long brown hair and a big grin! :)  My best friend may be easier to spot 
- Her name is Melanie and she is a short blonde who ususally wears a neon 
green windbreaker or a neon orange sweatshirt. She may be easier to spot 
than me, but you can be sure I will be near by.

Eric P., you sound like you won't be hard to miss - I shall keep a 
careful eye out for ya.   This rave is gonna go OFF!  Thank goodness my 
cold is better!

In Berlin and Vienna, thay actually have a little book like pamphlet thing
that goes around town that has practicly every rave in it. Its fucking
sponsored by Camel cigaretes and shit, everyone knows about raves there,
everyone. And somehow they even find the undergrounds clubs sometimes. And
just like here, just go to a dance record store and ask. In London you should
pick up a Time out, and like I said, go to the record stores and grab a
flier. I gotta warn you though in advance, London loves jungle,.....just in
case it' s not your thing. But none of these cities compare at all to
Amsterdam. Imagine 20,000 people bouncing to Rotterdam for freakin hours. If
your any where around the time of a big one like a Hellraiser or an Id&T
show, i wouldn't worry about not seeing a flier. Hope this helps, smoke some
hydro chronic for me in Holland.

Who knows about the rest of the planet, but when in Paris, tune in 98,2 FM
(Radio FG98,2).  They play house, etc almost 24/7, and they will know (if
you can listen & understand french) where/when all the shit kickin'
parties will be. I don't really care for the on-the-air flamers, but if
you can extract the information, it would be worth it.  There are
definitely good happenings to be had.

Dear Friends & Family,

My computer tells me that on Fri, 9 Feb 1996, Lee Fogel shared:

"People must not do things for fun.  We are not here for fun.  There is 
no reference to fun in any Act of Parliament."
		-A.P. Herbert (1890-1971) in "Uncommon Law" (1935)

Would that it were so, Lee.

That is a truly sadistic prospect.  Even if it is true for some of those 
bent on implementing "law and order" at the expense of freedom, I don't 
think you would get many of them to admit it.  In any case, I prefer to 
give people the benefit of the doubt, even government thugs.  :) I assume 
they do what they do out of a sense of duty, not because they enjoy 
making others unhappy.

To clarify:  I'm not saying that people in government aren't interested 
in having fun themselves, on their own time, or even at work in some 
cases.  The bureaucratic outlook, however, strongly discourages 
the mixing of work and fun.  Sure the humorless bureaucrat is a 
stereotype -- and like most stereotypes, this one contains some truth.
	Show me a person having a lot of fun in a government job, and 
I'll show you a person who's probably bending a few rules.

Yours in liberty,

Yikes!  That would be too taxing on my truck, which is chancy to drive (bad

Hello,

Thanks to everyone who has or still will respond to my turntable 
question.  I greatly appreciate it.  It looks like Ortofon "nightclubs" 
and Stanton 680's are the favorites.  As money dictates I will be going 
with the 680's.  Mabey when/if I mix at parties I will look into 
investing in "nightclubs".  Thanks a million everyone!

Hello everyone,

    Well, there is a bit of confussion about how everything is going on 
tonight...

    For the people that bought presale tickets, you need to go to the 
map point, which is Frequency-8 on Haight st. We will open the map 
point up at 8pm. There, you will trade the ticket that you have already 
purchased, for an admission ticket into the party. (Everyone going to 
the party needs to have an admission ticket, wether you are on the 
guest list or not!!!) 

    For the people that have not bought the presale tickets, you can go 
to F-8, or Solid Grooves and pick one up. (I recommend calling them to 
make sure that they have them first.) Once you get your ticket, you 
will follow the same instructions as above. 

    Thank you for all of your support, and we'll see you tonight!!!

Peace,

Greg :)

   Hello from Raleigh, NC.  It's been a long time, but I was wondering
if anyone on this list might know how I could get a copy of the old
Connection II party tapes (there were 4 I believe).  I think it was a
SFRAVES party like 2-3 years ago.  Anyways, my copies eventually got
lost through the past years and would love to get new ones.  Thanks
for the help.

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        These Are the Stories Of The California Highway Patrol, told from
the other side(Just da Facts, House Nation)

        Diary of a Bust, Part 1, the Arrest:

        Date: 01/04/96

        Time & Conditions: Approximately 4:00am, on a Dark, 
        Drizzling, Thursday Morning

        Location: East Bay Bridge; East Bound, Lower Deck

        Vehicle Type: 1986 Chevy Station Wagon
                                aka The Yellow Submarine

        Bob had just left a wonderful evening of raver activities, while at
1015 Folsum's Community, and was headed home. Feeling great!!!!, he decided
to take the East Bay Bridge because it's the only way home(hint, hint, very
important info). Fiddling, with the car stereo because it was one of those
ones that required you to do that to get it to work, and because hearing Goa
Trance was more important than Life, Liberty & the Pursuit of Happiness,
driving was placed in the hands of the trusty autonavigator. An
autonavigator is a place in your mind, and doesn't have eyes that normally
would have noticed the California Highway Patrol car sitting in the darkness
off to the right. This important visual que would have prevented my slow &
clumsy entrance onto the lower deck of the East Bay Bridge, had it not been
fixed upon the tape player which at this point, had still not come on.

        After about 500 hundred yards of poor auto navigation on an
otherwise empty bridge, the recurrent imagery of the bridge itself, became
an overwhelming que, that hey, we're on the East Bay Bridge; autonavigator
off. When at the very same instance a car's headlights, too bright to have
come up from a distance behind, suddenly flashed across my rear view mirror.
His definition of fear suddenly redefined itself to the image of a police
car closing slowly from behind.

        At this point many things were happening both externally &
internally. Externally the police car got closer to him, and they both got
closer to Treasure Island. Internally he was trying to restructure himself
to appear to have some semblance of normalcy, figuring out what he had on
his person, where & whether his licensed was suspended or not, also
wondering what's in the car that I'm not aware of, and finally and to
himself;  if I get out of this I'm gone a go to church,.....NOT.

         While the lump in his throat grew & tightened they both approached
the off-ramp for Treasure Island. About 500 yards from the off-ramp the
police signaled with their really cool flashing, strobeing, blinking red,
yellow & blue lights for him to exit the highway. All of sudden the tape
player started to work, with LSD blasting out of it he thinks to himself
just another one of those nights, and quickly turns off the music.

        Though he had the very same experienced many times before, you never
ever get really comfortable with them. As they both made the twisty turns
off the off-ramp the police were attempting to give him directions on their
crappy wimpy PA where to go & stop the car; while he thought to himself,
hmmm will I get out of dis one.

        They both passed another police car/law breaker combination, an
thinking once again to himself hmmmm......that's odd. He though that at that
time of the morning on a week night why were so many highway patrol people
on the East Bay Bridge. The voice of the police over the PA broke his train
of thought, with them blurting out "turn left & stop the vehicle". He
complied with their command, and parked the vehicle in what looked liked a
bus stop over looking the city of Oakland. 

        Almost instantly Bob was greeted by a female voice & a halogen
flashlight in his eyes. License & registration spouted the womyn, he replied
I can't find my license, & the car isn't mine, but it is registered to my
friend Joe Blow and I am authorized to use it while he is in Europe. All
this time, the other police officer scanning my car for anything illegal.
Sir do you know why I stopped you, and he replied in a very polite tone yes
I was no doubt going to slow on the bridge officer, I was fiddling with my
radio trying to get it to work because that's what you have to do to get it
to work, and I guess I just wasn't paying any attention, and I'm real sorry,
mam. The officer asked me where I was coming from, and where he was going
to. Bob replied, a friends house & home, mam.

        She lowered the flashlight and I was greeted by an intelligent,
mechanical, well trained in their profession,  middle aged, 5'10", 200lb,
plump Attila the Hun, on PMS. Sir have you been drinking alcohol tonight? He
replied, no mam I don't drink, alcohol, because I don't like it & it doesn't
like me. She then started checking to see whether or not his pupils
responded to changes in light, by flashing the flashlight on and off. While
all the time, asking him whether or not he had done any drugs like speed or
cocaine tonight. He replied no, and she then asked him to turn the engine
off and get out of the car. His heart rate quickened, and he thought to
himself their going to take me in, fuck.

        He complied with her order, and that's when he met the other officer
and that's also when both off them saw the way Bob was dressed. He stood
before them dressed in an orange jacket, with black vinyl plants, and metal
plated biker boots, Bob smiled, and said hello officer. He was greeted by a
Julio Iglesias clone, and he actually felt a little relief over the
appearance of such a cheery character. She returned to the to the nice
shinny police cruiser, stating that "I don't know but he's on something". He
then proceeded to take up where she left off, asking Bob the same sort of
questions only repeatedly, and with a charged tone this time. Bob's fucus
then became the also, well trained but quietly intelligence male officer in
front of him who was riddling off new & old questions at what appeared to be
an almost manic rate.

        He must have been asked 20 - 30 or more times the same question did
you do speed or cocaine tonight, Bob's respondence no, every time with the
occasional, officer if I tell you that I was doing speed or cocaine tonight
I would be guilty of lying to a police officer, they continued their verbal
assault. Bob was thinking to himself, jesus their not asking the right
question should I give it to them,......NOT, I know I'm going in, I know I
will get out, eventually, I'm going to make them work for it. 

        That's when she got out of the car and said his license is
suspended, he's FTA, I'll take the car, you search him, also she said  I
just called for a wrecker; & he thought to himself, I don't care about
myself, but that's my friend's car, they can't impound it, fuck I'm going to
be sooo embarrassed.

        His search turned up a pipe, bag of pot; containing less than an oz,
and a unidentified small white tablet. Her search of the entire station
wagon, hood to tail turned up a baggy which she was certain off contained
speed, which Bob knew contained salt, and quietly giggled and thought to
himself, what a dumb ass. Their search also turned up a collar & leash which
amused them to no end.
        
        At this point Bob spoke up & said if you are sooo sure I'm drunk why
don't you give me a breathazier, all the time fully knowing that he didn't
have any alcohol and would blow a big flat 0. They jumped at the chance, and
gave it to him, they performed it twice, twice getting the same result to
their perplexed dismay. While Bob thought to himself, wah, wah. Then came
the sobriety test. The male officer then preceded to give Bob a sobriety
test which consisted of holding your head back and counting out loud amongst
other tedious, & inane tasks all of which I passed. The officer conducting
the tasks asked why are your shaking, Bob replied I'm scared.

        Then they started asking Bob all these other questions, like is
there anything wrong with my car, was I a diabetic, was I on any/certain
medications, all of which, less the car could be responsible for my pupils
not responding to light & being what Bob was told where as large as
quarters. Bob replied stupidly no, because he was unsure of the right answer
that could have sprung him from his peril. But also told them of them
medications he "believed he was taking" like Vicodin, Clariton-D, assorted
antibiotics, Pepcid, & Riddlin. The female officer fluster a little what's
Pepcid she said I've never heard of that one. Bob responded, not sure I
think for my stomach, but various doctors have me on numerous medications
really don't keep track of them to much, while also thinking to himself, got ya.

        After that ordeal then they both started asking me again,
repeatedly, in harmony at times whether or not he did speed or cocaine. Bob,
at that point was so fed up with it that if they had asked him if he was the
uni-bomber he would have said yes, just to shut them up. Bob replied, ok
yes, I snorted a tiny little line of speed tonight. At first they acted
unconvincingly angry, and said aha ha lying to police officer that's felony.
Bob replied, sorry I was scared you guys have the guns, and this has never
ever happened to me before. They then looked sooo happy and then started
asking me the usual questions like where, when with whom. I gave them no
additional meaningful info. I added to my speed statement though I had
snorted a little line, I seriously doubted that it would show up on any
known test, while laughing out loud to himself.

        What's the little white pill asked the one officer? Bob replied it's
Zinc for my stomach, I take it along with my Pepcid. He then started filling
out paper work while the wrecker arrived and the other female officer
quietly walked over to Bob, while in hand cuffs at this, and asked Bob what
his very tight pants were made out of. Bob replied vinyl, and she replied
with, that they looked like they would tear realy easily. Bob thought eeek,
is she into vinyl, bondage, S&M or just wants to kill me.

        They then stuck me into the car and we headed off to the Hall of
Injustice, it's about 4am or so now. Bob asked how long am I going to be in
jail for. the female officer responded usually four to six hours from time
of arrest if their not busy, then you either see the judge or they let you
go and tell you to come back in thirty days for a court appearance. At this
point Bob had no indication what he was being charged with, with no
indication from them.

        They arrived at the police station shortly, and took him out of the
car. The one officer asked Bob are you comfortable with your arms like that?
Bob replied, yes of course can't you tell I'm weird office, and at that
moment they entered the jail.......

Part 2, JAIL: .........TO BE CONTINUED...........

        The names have been changed to protect the innocent & the guilty.
But I think you can guess who I'm talking about, duh!!!!!!!

     Well, both of my rides fell through at the last minute, and now I'm
stuck here in santa cruz with a pretty crayon shaped ticket and no way to get
myself to harmony.  If any of you are going, and have extra space in your car
(I'll ride in the glove box if I have to) then please page me ASAP at
684-4834.  Any help at all you can give me will be appreciated.  Thanks,

woop, what a shindig!  these fellas really know how to throw a 
supervibey, elaborate party. 
The decorations were superb.  The lighting and visuals were incredible.  
The music was hella phat (?), and there was so much of it to choose 
from!  Actually, almost too much... when I was dancing in one room, I 
kept thinking "but wait, what am I missing in the other two rooms now?".
I was really impressed that they opened the back stairway and the 
'secret' chill room at the back of the first floor (I'm talking about 
Acme here).  Lots of space to inhabit.
What *really* impressed me were the fire extinguishers located in every 
room--it was great to see that effort went into not only the 
party fixings, but also the safety of the partygoers.  This is 
particularly important at Acme, because that place could become a 
deathtrap rather quickly.
As is always the case at Acme, it was really hot and there wasn't much to 
do about it.  The doorpersons couldn't allow ins and outs, due to certain 
permit problems, but they did open up the garage door in front, letting a 
breeze in.  That was nice.
Ethan spun in place of some dude who got snowed in on the East coast... 
but frankly, I don't think I could have enjoyed anything more than 
Ethan's set anyway.  Hooray for blizzards!  It was a wonderful surprise.
Tony spun around midnight, and he also *went off bigstyle*.  He mixed the 
most diverse set I've heard in ages; thumpin house, acid, crazy 
breakbeats (!!!), and a Eurythmics song!  (wait, that was Tony, right?)

	in all, one of the best parties I've ever been to.

		mo' later,

Yeah, it was fun til the place filled up.  By 1 am it was too  hot and too
humid for me to do ANY kind of dancing. It was so frustrating because the
music WAS really good, but because of so many people it was *unbelievably*
hot & humid.
It was  literally a steam sauna in there!  I'm sorry but I sure as hell
cannot dance in that kind of an environment. So I sat on my ass the entrire
night in the upstairs chill room, because it was the only tolorable place
to be temperature-wise.  The vibe WAS really good - this party would have
been incredible if it  had been held in a larger place. Even the chill room
was getting intolorable by  4:30 (still not much crowd thinning out) so I
went outside to cool off a bit.  Well, put it this way, the ONLY dancing I
was able to do was to John Carel's set in the end upstairs.  It never felt
so good to dance - I had been waiting all night long to do it!! :)  So we
stayed and danced til the second floor closed off.

I did get to meet some new sfravers:  Robert Brown and Eric Peterson.  It
was so fun to introduce so many sfravers to each other.  I probably nearly
overwhelmed SteveO from Sacramento after introducing and pointing out
fellow internet friends! :)  So, overall, this would have been a most
incredible wonderful party had it not been for the heat!! So there is this
rave critic's review. :)

love,
Amy S

hello all-

i hope harmony was cool for those who went to it, but i had to do that
entirely human thing: sleep!

i have 2 favors to ask people:

1) can someone give me the new moon number?  i guess i'm not one of the
elect who has it, but would like to me.

2) i'm also thinking of going to organic.  is there anyone who would be able
to do either of the following
        -bring me there from sf, or
        -pick me up from bart in the east bay?

either way, i can help pay gas and such.

please, pretty please, can someone call me with either of these bits of info?

try 415-752-3218, and if that doesn't answer, try 415-939-8780 (cellular).

thank you!!!

peace, love, and dancing-

Wow!! What a night! We would like to thank all of you who came out last 
night for the party. It was simply beautiful!! Thank you soooo much for 
your support!!!

And to the crew... thanks for all your help putting this one together. 
You really made it happen!

Also, if anyone lost or left anything at the party call (408)486-9591 
and leave a detailed message as to what you lost. (We found a whole 
bunch of stuff)

In regards to Terry Mullan, he was snowed in at the Baltimore airport 
and could not get a flight out here. We have talked with him, and he 
will be spinning at our next party, (if mother nature lets him). 

Anyways, thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone for making last 
night really special!!!

Peace, love, and harmony to all beautiful people,

Greg :)

Subject: Bruce Eisner on Ecstasy Damage Reports
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Recently, Reuters News Service and CNN reported that seven young men in
England had died with "brain, liver and heart damage" from using ecstasy
(MDMA) at raves. However, after information I have received from Dr.George
Greer and Rick Doblin of MAPS, I can safely report that, to paraphrase Mark
Twain, the "reports of ecstasy deaths has been greatly exaggerated."

First, it must be pointed out that over one half million people take disco
biscuits every weekend. These are tablets which sometimes contain MDMA but
sometimes combinations of other drugs and sometimes MDMA so polluted with
impurities that it should not be used.

Second, these deaths occurred in very extreme "rave" conditions, with high
temperatures and humidity and were attributed to "heatstroke." In one case,
a young man had died after drinking the equivalent of 2 1/2 gallons of
water, and the cause of his death was called "water intoxication." 

Now, 30 deaths in England, in perhaps 100 million exposures of people to
what they think is ecstasy, is not a remarkably high fatality rate. More die
of playing soccer during its season than die of ecstasy-related problems,
but still this is a huge factor. In fact, the only thing that could be said
about the young men and women were that MDMA was found in their blood at the
time of their death; there is no evidence that it caused their deaths. 

Yet the media reports as published in papers nationally and mentioned on CNN
made ecstasy sound like a "death drug." Certainly many times the number die
of alcohol-, amphetamine- and heroin-related causes every day than the total
number reported in the study. The study was obviously designed to produce
fear in the public about a drug which has been shown to be remarkably safe
when used in moderate doses at infrequent intervals.

Actually, your message doesn't give any convincing documentation whatsoever
that you can safely report anything. I believe you can "safely" preach to
the converted, but your statements aren't convincing me of anything.
If you want to convince me, give me statistics, facts, and methodology
on how your data was collected.

How did you arrive at this figure?? Given that MDMA is illegal, I would
imagine that this is a highly bogus, highly subjective number. Don't
worry, I pick on marketing bozos at work in the same way when they pull
bullshit numbers out of the air to back up their hairbrained ideas.

Many of the bad effects of alchohol, especially carcinogenicity is
caused by "pollution" with byproducts of the fermentation process.
Urethanes, etc formed from the fermentation of fruit and some grain
based liquors.  However, it is very rare to find people drinking pure
ethanol, just like it is rare for people to get pure MDMA. The
corollary to your statement must then be -- since some (actually most)
MDMA is impure, it is dangerous some (actually most) of the time, and
you never will know when!

> Second, these deaths occurred in very extreme "rave" conditions, with high

The question to ask is whether these people would have died had they
not been on MDMA? Would the "young man's" judgement have been impaired
under normal circumstances such that he drank 2.5 gallons of water?
Would people have danced past their heat dissipation limit had they not
been on MDMA?

Lots of alchohol deaths occur from drunk driving. But the facts are 
that deaths occured, and alchohol helped induce the lack of judgement
that caused death. Given that, you might as well say that alchohol is
for the most part safe, and the deaths are caused by "extreme driving
conditions"??

> Now, 30 deaths in England, in perhaps 100 million exposures of people to

Where are you pulling these numbers from?
 
> More die

> but still this is a huge factor.

By now I'm getting tired of people pulling numbers out of their floppy hats.
 
> In fact, the only thing that could be said

> time of their death; there is no evidence that it caused their deaths. 

I guess the same can be said about the hypothetical dead drunk driver
with 0.3 blood alchohol reading. After all, what caused the death, the
fact that his/her brain is  splattered on the windshield after the
driver decided to play chicken with oncoming traffic at 100MPH, ... or
the fact that the driver was drunk? Clearly, it's because the drivers
brain was dripping off the shattered glass. Alchohol had nothing to do
with it, right?

> Yet the media reports as published in papers nationally and mentioned on CNN
> made ecstasy sound like a "death drug."

Life is a death drug. People should be aware of the dangers involved. 
I don't think you're doing anybody a service by minimizing the messages
given in the papers. (Granted, they are fueled by a W.O.D. hysteria,
but notheless, there problably is some truth behind the hype).

> Certainly many times the number die

Statistics please. Where do you get these "figures" ? I can point to  a
few somewhat productive 70 year old heroin chippers. Some of my
favorite college professors (famous computer scientists) had histories
of amphetamine use, but their still here today and still appear
productive and healthy (of course, they don't use the shit anymore).
Time will tell about the MDMA users, since it's too new.

How about this -- let's give people the facts and let them decide!

How moderate? How infrequent? How safe?

[ To sfraves mailist ]

Recently , Gregory Sandler thanked those of us who went to Harmony -
 
> Wow!! What a night! We would like to thank all of you who came out 
last 
> night for the party. It was simply beautiful!! Thank you soooo much 
for 
> your support!!!
> 
 Thank You !  I've never seen that site looking so good , and the extra
rooms were a pleasant surprise too. 

 Someone mentioned the temperature - from previous experience , I 
dressed
with long pants over denim shorts , and I put away the shorts as soon 
as
I got there. Didn't miss the long pants at all - even when I left , I 
was
so warm from Harmony that I drove home to Sunnyvale without feeling the
need to put them on again.

 So many smiles ...

 If I hadn't been at work all day Friday , I probably would have had 
the 
to stay all night - instead , I left early at about 12:30 AM . Also - I
never usually stay at that site too long - it gets too crowded for me .
I left after getting my toes stomped and making incidental hand & elbow
contact with too many folks.

 On the other hand , lots of folks seem to like a "close & sweaty"
environment. Harmony was the place for that.

 Still - I got my fill of dancing , with maximum joy! Congratulations 
to
the Harmony organizers - let's hope for a more spacious site in the 
future!

 Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com 

 General Harmony notes: Hello to Jo(h)n (?) and Julie and Steve/Not Dan 

  and Elan (sic) and Shawna and Amy and her friend and "Video" Mike 
  and everybody else I met last night ( I was the guy with the red 
  goggles and the shorts ). 
   DJ BioJeff was good , and I got to hear a great set by Brandon ( who 

  works at Solid Grooves in San Jose ).

On the Matter of MDMA Use
=========================

Bruce Eisner wrote today (Feb. 18, 1996):

   "I can safely report that, to paraphrase Mark Twain, the 
    "reports of ecstasy deaths has been greatly exaggerated."
    .... The [Journal of Clinical Psychology] study [by C.M.Milroy
    et al., 1996, Vol. 49, pp. 149-153] was obviously designed 
    to produce fear in the public about a drug which has been 
    shown to be remarkably safe when used in moderate doses at 
    infrequent intervals."

My son Morgan's death on April 30 last year from a moderate dose 
of Ecstasy was not greatly exaggerated.

Nicholas Saunders (author of "E is for Ecstasy") wrote on Sept. 26,
in reply to my Sept. 25 posting about Morgan's death:

   "However, I do stand by my conclusion about the relative 
    safety of MDMA, ... taken sensibly and in moderation by 
    healthy people, the risks of taking MDMA are no more than 
    many other accepted forms of recreation, and are probably 
    less than alcohol use....

   "It may be cold hearted, but statistical risk is more 
    relevant to sensible decision making than closeness to a 
    personal tragedy."

I wanted to reply to Saunders (and now also to Eisner) in a way
that was informed and not biased because of my "closeness to a
personal tragedy."

For that reason, I asked David Smith, Founder and President of 
the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics in San Francisco, and Rick Seymour,
Information and Education Director of the Clinics, to draft a reply
for me.  They very kindly agreed to do so.  I am not an expert on
MDMA use, but I concur with them.

Their statement follows.

My best wishes to all of you.

                  ******************************

                    ON THE MATTER OF MDMA USE
        David E. Smith, M.D. and Richard B. Seymour, M.A.

Peter Jones, the father of Morgan Jones, who died after ingesting
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), has asked us to draft a
statement for the Internet regarding the risks involved in using
MDMA.  We have collectively had some experience in researching
and writing about clinical aspects of MDMA use.  Writings include a
booked titled MDMA written by Seymour in 1986, several articles co-
authored in the following years, and the co-chairing of a two-day
national conference, "MDMA: A Multidisciplinary Conference," in
1986.  Most recently, we co-authored a booklet, "The Psychedelic
Resurgence: Treatment, Support, and Recovery Options," published by
Hazelden.  Our findings are based on clinical observations at the
Haight Ashbury Free Clinics and discussions with colleagues in
addiction medicine throughout the United States and overseas.  Our
opinions are our own, and do not represent Haight Ashbury Free
Clinics or any other treatment center or organization.

First of all, the greatest risk from taking any illegal drug is 
that the user has no guarantee that the drug's content is what it 
is said to be.  There is no Illicit Food and Drug Administration out 
there protecting the user from potentially toxic substances, either 
used as filler or as a replacement for the active ingredients the 
drug is supposed to contain.  MDMA is no exception, and its users 
are not immune from the greed, ignorance, carelessness of 
unscrupulous cookers and dealers.  It has been argued that if MDMA 
were legal, its quality could be controlled, but the reality is 
that MDMA use and manufacture is illegal now, and most likely will 
remain illegal for the foreseeable future.

Early researchers on the potential for therapeutic use noted a 
variety of individuals for whom taking MDMA, even at therapeutic 
levels, is particularly risky -- physicians would say "contra-
indicated."  These include: individuals with histories of 
hypertension, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, 
hypoglycemia, seizure disorder or glaucoma.  The list also includes 
women who are pregnant or may be pregnant, and individuals with a 
history of socially or vocationally disabling psychological 
conditions.  We have added from experience, anyone with a history 
of alcohol or other drug abuse and addiction.

While these contra-indications may seem clear, it must be
remembered that most users of MDMA are young people with no
history of these medical problems.  No history does not mean that
these conditions don't exist.  Individuals, tragically including 
Morgan Jones, may not know that they have a heart problem or 
hypertension that could be triggered into a potentially fatal attack 
by MDMA's sympathomimetic effects.  These effects, shared with such 
stimulants as methamphetamine and cocaine, include the shrinking of 
blood vessels (vasoconstriction) and can elevate blood pressure to
dangerous levels for those who are at risk.  The number of 
individuals who are at such risk and do now know it may be
statistically small, but who wants to be a statistic?  There may be
more chambers in the gun, but does anyone really want to pull a
chemical trigger when the result may well be death or permanent
disability?  We have found that some individuals, after ingesting
MDMA, have a prolonged posthallucinogen perceptual disorder
(PHPD) with significant neuropsychological impairment.  It has been
suggested that the disorder is caused by MDMA induced impairment
of the brain's serotonergic system.

Individuals with a history of alcohol and other drug abuse are
particularly at risk.  In a review of Nicholas Saunders book, 
"E is for Ecstasy," in the "Journal of Psychoactive Drugs,"
Volume 26(3), 1994, Richard Seymour had the following to say:

"Saunders has not obscured the downside of MDMA, but one thing
workers in the drug treatment and recovery field are apt to find
alarming is his lack of understanding regarding the nature of
addiction, and the message that this may communicate to individuals
who are at risk for addictive disease.  According to Saunders, 
"A drug is considered addictive if physical withdrawal symptoms 
occur when a regular user stops taking it.  MDMA is not addictive 
by this definition..."  Such a misunderstanding of addiction was 
one of the factors that led to widespread cocaine use in the United 
States in the general belief that because cocaine did not produce 
the same withdrawal found with heroin and barbiturates, it was not 
an addictive drug.  Addiction is now generally thought to be a
progressive disease, characterized by compulsion, loss of control, 
and continued use of a substance in spite of adverse consequences, 
and by that definition, MDMA can be addictive.

"Another point of alarm is the concept that MDMA can be used by
individuals to self-treat their addiction to other drugs, such as 
heroin or alcohol.  While some psychoactive drugs are used 
therapeutically in drug detoxification, such as the use of 
phenobarbital taper to reduce the danger of life-threatening 
seizures during alcohol and sedative withdrawal, the self-treatment 
of addiction with other drugs is what the recovering community calls, 
"changing seats on the Titanic."  Switching from the use of one 
psychoactive drug to another does nothing to alleviate addiction, 
and in fact may make matters worse by increasing the scope of the 
addiction to include the new drug and reinforcing the addict's 
rationale for denial."

While there are obviously dangers and concerns, there are also 
some major public misconceptions about MDMA.  MDMA has often been 
confused in the media with the heroin-like designer drugs, such as
fentanyl analogs, that have been responsible for opioid overdoes,
and with an illicit demerol analog that contained an impurity that
caused a Parkinson's disease-like paralysis in its users.  One of the
most persistent misconceptions, and one we hear often at the Haight
Ashbury Free Clinics, is that MDMA somehow "drains spinal fluid."

While we are both against the legalization of any further
psychoactive drugs at this time, we do feel that legitimate clinical
research on such substances as MDMA should be encouraged.  In the
past, we have gone on record advocating the adoption of a treatment
research schedule that would allow this to take place outside the
sanctions for illicit manufacture and sale to the general public.
Without adequate research in controlled settings, much concerning
MDMA and other outlawed substances remains a question mark,
creating a public health danger and making it difficult to assess 
the full spectrum of risks involved in their use.

Sincerely,
David E. Smith, M.D.
Richard B. Seymour, M.A.

Hello again,

  Since you have posted again to the list and have no particular interest
in "raving" except as an aftermath of your son's all to early death - I
read the statement regarding MDMA use and I also agree with everything
within the statement....

That said: I wonder if you understand that the statement in no way indicates
that MDMA is a particularly dangerous drug? It does indicate and correctly
so that MDMA being illegal is NOT subject to purity control but this is true
of all uncontrolled substances. Foreign substances of various toxic levels
may be included in underground MDMA but this in no way answers the question
about the effects of MDMA itself.

   There is the warning about the drug being particularly dangerous for 
persons with varying conditions such as heart disease etc.... but these 
people are statisticly few at the young age of most users ( the statement
asks " but who wants to be a statistic ". Unfortunately, this is the group
that your son probably fell into.  BUT again these facts do not make MDMA
a particularly dangerous drug... For example, it's well known that certain
high risk individuals have been killed by aspirin but this fact does not
make aspirin a high risk drug FOR MOST individuals - yet the fact remains
that FOR SOME it will be deadly.....
 
  The statement has other things to say about the false " spinal fluid drain"
and addiction etc.  but again there is no particular inditment of MDMA as
a particularly dangerous drug. There is lastly the wise agreement that the
drug should be studied further. This is as it should be....


   As a final opinion of my own, I am saddened by modern society's denial of
death as being part of life. We deny death, we fear death, we pretend 
that it doesn't happen. We deny the old and the tragicly ill people even the
possibility of a death with dignity - if that means that suicide is the only
means of that dignity. We keep people on life support until  the very end to
deny death. We would rather pump someone so full of opiates that they no 
longer feel the joy of life than to allow them to die; even when that 
death is inevitable. We feel that no one should ever die of accidents and 
when they do we sue everyone remotely connected with the cause because of
it being "their fault" that produced death. Or as might be the case in your
son's death, we blame a cause so much that we attempt to deny its access to
other individuals. (It's a wonder we still allow anyone to swim. )

    Death is no longer an acceptable part of living in the "American Dream"
of the late 20th century. If we could we would outlaw it. We are living
life out of balance. For us there is only the embracing of life - and of
course spending $$$ ;-)   and the denial of death. Read the Castenada books.
We like Carlos are unaware that death is always our companion especially 
because we deny and fear it so much..... and yet as always, each and 
every one of us has an appointment with death and no amount of denial will
stop that appointment from taking place.

Now back to our regularly scheduled sfraves discussions ;-)

Wowee!

That was one damned killer party if I do say so myself!  Only complaint 
being (obviously!) the heat, no escaping that!  That hard room rocked!  
It was a really nice surprise to hear Ethan unexpectedly spin in place 
of the snowed-in guy, very nice of him to do that!  As usual, I met new 
sfravers (hey there starchild & Eric!), I don't think I've been to a 
single rave yet (including weeklies & all) where I haven't met at least 
one new sfraver.  & of course, saw all my old favorite ravers too, (hi 
amy, wayne, tim, tom, jon, brian, and everybody else I can't remember!) 


Having all the nifty rooms around was really cool, I almost got lost!  
It was nice to be able to check out the basement, this was only the 
second time I've been to the Acme, & it was really cool having so many 
places to be.  I feel like I spent the entire time wandering from room 
to room, cause there's always guaranteed to be something new & nifty 
around each corner ya turn.  Everybody was so happy & smilin, kept a 
big ol' smile on my face the entire time.  It was so totally what I 
needed, I haven't been to a really good rave since the last Chrysalis & 
I was just bursting at the seams!  Didn't really dance as much until 
the later hours of the evening, when it thinned out a bit in the hard 
room & I could dance without stepping on feet or slipping in humidity & 
sweat!  Boy, when I first got there & walked up the stairs into that 
room, the humidity hit me like a wall, kinda like getting off of an 
airplane in Mexico!  Definitely laundry time I'd say. ;)

Thank you to all you wonderful people (on & off this list even, even 
tho you won't get this!) who showed & made it so spectacular.  Everyone 
was so friendly, I never had any worries about anything.  At one point 
I was sitting in the upstairs chill-room at the back talking to 
someone, when all of a sudden I feel all these arms on me from behind.  
They gently pull me backwards, & one set starts giving me a backrub & 
the other set starts running her hands thru my hair.  In any other 
situation, I would have been very alarmed to feel hands suddenly pull 
me back like that, but here it was nothing but a pleasant experience. 
It never occurred to me to worry, and it never occurred to them to do 
something that would give me cause to worry.  For me, being able to be 
like that is very much a part of what it's about.  Thank you all for 
making me feel that way!

Love,
Shawna

Dear Mike:

    I did read the Castaneda books.  Of course, death is a part
of our world.  It is all around us.  You are correct to suggest
that society doesn't pay enough attention to death, and it 
doesn't help us much to evaluate risks correctly.

    Morgan's death may have been statistically rare (I am not
sure), but it was certainly totally unnecessary, and better
information could have saved his life.  In May of 1994 he collapsed
on the sidewalk in the SoMa area of San Francisco after taking
Ecstasy.  He was found unconscious on the sidewalk, and was taken
by ambulance to S.F. General Hospital.  For about five hours he
was conscious, but could not talk.  When I arrived, I asked him,
"Where do you go to school?"  He said, "Redwood High School."
I said, "No, that was last year.  Where do you go now?"  He said,
correctly, "Santa Cruz."

    He recovered then.  Then he went on to the Web and read
everything he could about the drug, including Saunders' book,
and including a bunch of people, who say, like you, that life
is full of risks and it is reasonable to take them, and MDMA is
not particularly risky.  He did not put two and two together and
realize that what he had already had was an "idiosyncratic"
reaction and that the drug was poison to him.  He was, of course,
assisted in not putting two and two together by his own desire to 
deceive himself, but also by a lot of hear-no-evil, see-no-evil, 
speak-no-evil people on the Web, whose bottom-line approach
to evaluating risks seems to be that "life is dangerous; loosen
up and enjoy it."

    Clearly the stuff is dangerous.  How dangerous is uncertain.
But it is dangerous enough.

    I am appalled when people like Bruce Eisner condemn with dismissive
and bigoted language ("The study was obviously designed to produce 
fear in the public," Eisner) apparently serious attempts to
get at the truth, such as the recent Journal of Clinical Psychology
study whose contents were posted to this newsgroup.  [Journal of 
Clinical Psychology, 1996, Vol. 49, pp. 149-153 article by C.M.Milroy, 
et al.]

    Is taking MDMA more dangerous than, say, flying a lot on commuter
airlines?  I don't know.  But plenty of reasonable people choose
to NOT fly on commuter airlines.  My brother, who is a gold 
exploration geologist and who has to travel all around the west, 
chooses to not fly on commuter airlines.  He drives.  He does ski, 
and this is of course dangerous.

    I just would not include taking illicit MDMA among the set
of risky things I would do.

Luuuvely,
Yes indeed, two thumbs straight up!  The Humidity (lack of fans, or just
oversold tickets) was awfull, but in a strange way, kind of cleansing.  Big
thanks to Amy for introducing me to several sfravers. Robert, Eric, Captain
Crunch, ....  All you guys are great!!  I think what really made this go off
was the vibe concentration.  The fact that the tickets were pre-sold I think
really helped.  Yeah, sometimes it's a pain in the ass, but then again we can
see some of the problems we've run into, now that raving is such a convenient
thing, a place to go for anyone looking to "hang out".  The fact is, is that
everyone there friday night was there because that is truly where they
desired to be.  They had to DO something to get those tickets.  They didn't
just show up, because someone told them that raves are the place to go to
"meet chicks", or get e or whatever.    As that one lovely brother put it in
the downstairs chill room fri. night, and so many nights before,  "APPRECIATE
THIS!!!",...    and we did.    (God, I love that guy!)

How does anyone else feel about this idea?  What can we do in the future to
maintain this purity amongst the people, without being elitist or making it
very difficult for us out of towners?

Once again, thanks Harmony folks!
Love & Life,
Steveo

Subject: CABIN TRIP FINALIZED!

Well, sort of.  What I've done is requested everyone to tell me what dates
they cannot go.  It looks like the first two weekends of march are out for a
lot of folks, and with the weather continuing to suck as it may, the last
weekend may be pushing it, also I'm leaving to central america on the 31st.
 This leaves the weekend of the 16th or of the 23rd, both of these weekends
there are only two people whose schedule this conflicts with.  We still
haven't got a cabin, so unfortunately I am going to say the 16TH OF MARCH.
 Those whose schedule this conflicts with, please try to do what you can do
make it.  And if you can't, we'll see if we can set up an IRC channel so you
can participate to some extent.  If there are other people who just had
something come up, and can't make it the 16th, let me know asap and perhaps
we'll have to bump it to the 23rd.  
O.K. as for the participants, I've received 26 responses for a total of 56
people who are interested.  Well obviously thats going to be a tight squeeze
in any cabin, but I am counting on about 18-25 people who will actually be
able to send a check and make it.  If I am underestimating, no problem, well
get two cabins! 
Now here's the deal, since my only spare $ is being stashed away for my
central america trip, I can't throw down on the cabin up front.  I will pay
the deposit ($250-1000) on my plastic.  As for the rent, I paid i think $250
for a nice two story, 4 bed duplex last year, so I'm making a rough estimate
of $350 for a bigger nicer place.  Assuming 20 people can make it, that means
$17.50 a person, not bad for a weekend of alpine bliss, hot toddys & hot
tubs, boarding and bonding with a plethora of DJ's and performances willing
to play and experiment like you're not going to hear at any party.  Any
differnece will be made up when we get there.  Any unforseen damages, I trust
can be shared.  Below is the list of repondents, and the number of guests at
the end. Make sure you're on there, if not let me know as soon as you can.

Also, please check the list, if you're name has an asterik after it this

because we may be scheduling arouund you. Thanks

I'll be searching for our perfect place this week, and post ya'll on the
progress.  Thanks everyone!! Oh yeah, if you have any questions that need a
direct reponse, please call me. My stupid ao hell account charges me for
outgoing mail.  My weekday ph# is 800.388.8890, option 3, extension 777, my
weeknight ph is 916.443.8225, and my pager 916.855.6762 (this one may be your
best bet).  Anyone interested that hasn't already responded, feel free to
inquire, but it may depend on the # of actual respondents and the size of our
place.  First to get the checks in, besides the first respondents, first
guaranteed a spot.  And if anyone know someone with a really big cabin, hey
your in !
Here is my address, but you may want to hold off on sending any checks till
tue, as I may have more accurate info on price, and the date will be set for
absolute sure.  Feel free to post date the checks till sometime after next
week.  Sorry so damn long of a post, love yous

So I went to The Beat in Sacramento the other day and sifted through the 
tons o' wax they have and came to the surface with a few records I wanted 
to listen to and possibly buy.  So I went to the counter and asked where 
the turntable was (noticing the 5 or 6 CD players customers were using) 
and the woman behind the counter look bewildered and took off to talk to 
some other Beat employee.  When she returned, she told me that they no 
longer allow customers to listen to records (used or new) before buying 
them because it is some sort of security risk.  I would think this would 
be more of a profit risk since fewer people are likely to buy less stuff 
if they can't listen to it first.  Anyone else run into this kind of B/S?

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        There's a misrepresentation here regarding drugs and chemistry in
general, MDMA is being used as a scape goat for the flaws of modern
medicine, science, and pharmacology.

        Most, if not all substances produced, and or modified by man for
internal ingestion into the human body have a statistic death rate
associated with them.

        We are very naive to believe that in an infinitely diverse society
made up of human beings,  for the most part who are totally unlike one
another that anything we take, for the most part will have the same effect
across the board. People, this belief and the belief that medicine and
science have all the answers is poppy cock. No so called science is exact,
not one, sorry. The fact is people are going to die, from safe substances
from all substances, it is our basic nature to be different, and this
includes different reactions to different substances ranging from the
extreme to the common to none.

        I strongly implore you to pick up any addition of the PDR, the
Physicians Desk Reference and look at the drugs page by page, and I know
that you will find at least 75% of the substances listed there have either
killer, harmed, or least made people sick from either the substance itself
or with combinations of food as simple and as harmless as everyday American
cheese eg MAO Inhibitors commonly used in the treatment of depression.
Tylenol found in every household in American according to the very
conservative poison control people taken in doses of 40 grams or more are
far more deadly the a single dose of MDMA for most people. Not to mention
the horrible, & prolonged way you die from a Tylenol overdose, provided you
don't receive the antidote in 16 - 24 hours.

        Some medications deemed therapeutic have very serious and harmful
long term side affects so severe and potentially harmful that the people
taking these drugs have to be routinely monitored by medical staff eg
Teg-ra-tol commonly used in the treatment of seizure disorders.

        Most of the new medications like Prozac, sold as the miracle drug of
the 90's internal actions on the body and causes of the side effects are
unknown to humankind at present. This is stated in the PRD under Prozac,
Actions category.

        I totally agree with the fact that if you don't know who's making
the substance, you have no assurance of it's ingredients or the level of
quality control. 

        But please don't attempt to blame a substance that until 1985 was
deemed by the very analy conservative FDA as safe and therapeutic. Blame the
people or either cut, and/or compromise, the original recipe for reasons of
lack of safe approved production chemicals/equipment and or greed.

        Blame our government for it's futile oppression for substances that
are clearly wanted and desired BY THE PEOPLE, who are supposedly living in
the free world. Yet alcohol, and tobacco are still the number one killers
and are still legal.

        I dream of a day when science is exact, and no more people have to
die because we are so clueless in our understanding of ourselves. I dream of
the day when our defense budget looks more like our budget for medical
research, health & welfare of the people of the world. I dream of a day when
we live in a society where people believe in themselves rather than the need
for some external substance or a belief that a non-existent God will save them.

        I respect life among all things, and anytime someone dies an
original masterpiece, a priceless work of art is lost to us all, for we are
then less than what we were. 

        But what is life without freedom of thought, expression, dreams,
trust, action(provided it doesn't directly harm another) ...etc. Many
religious people would stay that this is the bibles definition of
hell.............

        So I ask you, will totally abolishing this substance from the planet
even mildly improve the condition of our planet, and or the human condition.
Please if someone out there can give me hard clear, beyond a shadow of a
doubt & my own experience that this will happen, then you will have my total
support in this effort.

        But in the defense of MDMA, it HELPED me end a 32 year prison of
sexual & emotional isolation, a living hell. Where the wonder drugs failed,
where the therapeutic minds of America couldn't help, I am free as a result
of this drug, and myself. Where one finds life & freedom, another may find
death, this is the human condition and for right now and it is not ours to
change.............

Sincerely
Brian Darknes^2

PS        I strongly encourage private, informed, intelligent, non-character
assasinating debate on this topic, and please sight your sources when your
stating facts......

>Early researchers on the potential for therapeutic use noted a

>While these contra-indications may seem clear, it must be

>progressive disease, characterized by compulsion, loss of control, 
>and continued use of a substance in spite of adverse consequences, 
>and by that definition, MDMA can be addictive.

>"Another point of alarm is the concept that MDMA can be used by

Beg pardon, but we have had at least one death in the Bay Area in the last
year which was very likely related to MDMA use, according to the medical
report.  I agree the number of deaths and illnesses from MDMA is relatively
small, but the risk is real.  The problem is that it is so hard to know who
is at risk and should avoid it.  I am allergic to bee stings, for example,
and nearly died as a result of a dozen or so wasp stings when I was a kid.
I went into anaphylactic shock and had to be taken to the hospital, looking
like a red and white checkerboard, where they pumped me full of antihistamine
and adrenalin (a wonderful boost, I might add, but not something I'd want
to take externally ever again).  This has more or less cured me of wanting
to go for lots of hikes or wherever our flying-stinging friends are.  Of
course, it's impossible to totally avoid bees and wasps, but at least I can
minimize my risk.

With unknown chemicals from an unregulated market, it is more difficult to
deal with these risks.

I agree that the health risks of MDMA are fairly minor, but they do exist
and I think it is dangerous to say, as Bruce Eisner/Ehrlich did, that
"there is no evidence that it caused" the reported deaths in the UK or
others that have occurred in conjunction with MDMA.  Unless the medical
reports say so specifically, I think we have to go with the probability
that it was involved.  

I know a thing or two about risk analysis, and I would definitely put MDMA
use in the relatively mild category.  It's less dangerous, statistically,
than playing soccer, as the quote goes.  But given the proclivity ofthe
media to repeat the mindless scare stories of the control freaks in our
society, it's very important to be candid about the risks of all the
substances we have floating around in our society.

Well, just to be fair, I think Neils is going too far as well.  The numbers
for the consumption of MDMA are fairly well established, especially in the
UK where this has been the subject of considerable academic study.  
The risks quoted may be off by as much as an order of magnitude either way,
but that's not very much in the grand scheme of things.

What that gets to, and what i didn't clearly say in my last post, is that
the integrity of what we say about MDMA usage or, in general, the quality
of our "scene," can be compromised if we dodge the facts and circumstances
about MDMA.  The problem with MDMA and many other substances -- both 
non-legal *and* legal, I might add -- is that toxicity is not always
obvious, and it varies considerably by individual.  For my friend who has
acute legume sensitivity and could actually die if she eats too many peanuts,
it is a constant annoyance to have to avoid certain foods and always ask how
restaurants cook things, but at least she knows the score as far as that
class of foods go.  Myself, I love peanuts and gobble 'em frequently.  
But in both cases we know our toxicity levels.  This is not the case for
substances like MDMA and many others -- again, let me hasten to add, many
legal ones -- which our bodies are not used to encountering in external
form and for which little cultural wisdom really exists.  I mean, we know
to avoid eating raw potatoes, right?  

So what we're really talking about here is developing the understructure of
cultural wisdom about substances like MDMA so that people don't just go
blithely necking their pills and tabs without really knowing what the
dangers are and being well prepared to deal with it.

I know, I know, this is a tall order, but that's the way it is for the human
race.  We are constantly inventing new ways to get ourselves into and out
of trouble!

Hello

the reason why the beat does not have any turntables is because everytime 
they got a new needle, somebody stole it.  Or at least that is the story 
that I was told in December as to why there were no turntables there?  
Has anybody else heard any other reasons????

Yea,  but the owner of the Acme space really fucked the Harmony promoters
by promising there would be fans available to keep the temperature more
tolerble.   I did NOT enjoy myself at all,  as I was spending all my time
by the front door trying to get some air,  always being in the way,  blocking
other people from moving around.    I think the Acme owners should have a
little more compassion and at least allow ins-and outs or make some kind
of effort to keep the invironment more friendly.

If I know that they would charge an additional $2 if it would make a difference
and go towards fan rental,  I would gladly pay it.

Subject: Re: MDMA USE
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Before turning the floor over to my esteemed colleague Rick Doblin at MAPS,
I would like to make the following comments concerning Peter Jones's post. 

While I sincerely sorry when anyone dies of drug use of any kind, as well as
deaths by many other ways that rob a person of their youth, I must make
these observations:

What drugs laws do is
1) Suppress the truth about what drugs do and what they don't do
2) Insure that peopled will take drugs without adequate knowledge and,
3) Insure that representation and contaminated drugs are consumed by youth
unconvinced by so called experts like Seymour and Smith.

With drugs laws, it would be more likely that Morgan's death may never have
occurred. What we need is wisdom and understanding to replace "Just Say No"
and Draconian drug laws, the current policy.

The greatest misunderstanding are 1) about the differences between drugs
(MDMA and LSD are not addictive in most people for example and are far safer
than alcohol and amphetamine which are addictive. And 2)confusion between
intelligent use and abuse. When these boundaries are obscured by
misinformation, the stage is set for much tragedy which has played itself in
the world during the year of the New Prohibition.  

Many of the warning given by Smith and Seymour are also given in my book.
Their list is a bit longer but I believe Rick Doblin, in the following
forward post discusses this quite well. However my book is not used as a
textbook in classes in intelligent drug use in high schools and adult
schools by most teachers. If it were, MDMA would be a much safer drug
because my book recommends that people be taught more intelligent drug use
in schools and in special centers, and that this training be funded by
replacing the current tough laws, which insure impure drugs will be consumed
by uninformed youth.

It is also true that some people have idiosyncratic reactions to many drugs.
For example, hundreds died because of adverse effects to asprrin, based on
DAWN report statistics of emergency rooms. Each of the parents or family of
those who die could lead a crusade against drug stores, but I don't think
that this would result in the popular analgesic being taken off the shelves
in drug stores.

I urge everyone has posted to read my book, Ecstasy: The MDMA Story (Ronin
Publishing Berkeley, 1989, 1994). Hundreds have people have told me that
this book has changed their lives for the better. I believe that the
ignorance must be replaced by knowledge, and that so-called experts like
Seymour and Smith, who take their money from the Government's NIDA, try a
different strategy...and they won't have so many young people strung out on
methamphetamine and heroin because they can't get clean MDMA or even MDMA at
all. And believe me, despite the urgings of these so-called experts, youth
will continue to experiment. Other cultures employ wise teachers and shamen
to train their youth in ritual, intelligent and moderate use of
mind-changing compounds. Why don't we make the world safer for them?

Bruce,

Here are some comments. You can post it if you like. I'm rushing to pack and
get ready to leave for Germany in a few hours.

Seymour and Smith deserve credit for coming out strongly in favor of MDMA
research. Their cautions regarding the risks of non-medical use are useful
reminders that all drugs carry some level of risk.  I evaluate the risks of
MDMA somewhat differently than Seymour and Smith.  Here are my comments on
their main concerns:

They state that early researchers felt that MDMA was contraindicated in
"individuals with histories of 
hypertension, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus,
hypoglycemia, seizure disorder or glaucoma.  The list also includes women who
are pregnant or may be pregnant, and individuals with a history of socially
or vocationally disabling psychological conditions.  We have added from
experience, anyone with a history of alcohol or other drug abuse and
addiction."


The list was originally prepared to be extremely cautious. Experience has
demonstrated that MDMA does not seem to pose a special risk to  people with
diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemia, or glaucoma.  MDMA can catalyze a seizure
but this is very rare and people with seizure disorder have taken MDMA with
no problems. MDMA raises blood pressure but it seems to be a serious risk
only in people with substantially compromised hearts. I don't know what to
say about hyperthyroidism. 

Many pregnant women have taken MDMA with no problem to their fetus. I know of
no case in the scientific literature which links MDMA to a specific birth
defect. Animal data does not suggest that MDMA causes birth defects.
Nevertheless, the use of any drug by a pregnant woman should be carefully
evaluated. 

To suggest that MDMA is contraindicated in people with alcoholism or
substance abuse disorders ignores numerous accounts of people using MDMA to
help themselves or others resolve problems of addiction to cocaine and other
drugs.  MDMA should be used cautiously by people with substance abuse
problems but the risks cannot be demonstrated to outweigh the potential
benefits (nor can the potential benefits be demonstrated to outweigh the
risks). 

MDMA itself has a low potential of addiction. Instead of "rearranging chairs
on the Titanic", the use of MDMA can help move someone from the Titanic to a
lifeboat. The seas are still rough but one's chances of survival can be
improved. This alternative outcome should not be written off as impossible.
 The key factors are preparation and follow-up support.

As to people with a history of socially or vocationally disabling
psychological conditions, what matters is the context within which MDMA is
taken. MDMA-assisted therapy can be very helful to people with a  history of
socially or vocationally disabling psychological conditions.

The comparison of taking MDMA to playing Russian roulette, "There may be more
chambers in the gun, but does anyone really want to pull a chemical trigger
when the result may well be death or permanent disability?" is excessive and
may cause Seymour and Smith's cautions to be dismissed as exaggerated
fearmongering. 

Over 120 high school students  have died in the past ten years as a result of
competitive sports injuries.  Since about 6 million kids participate every
year, the death rate is roughly 1 in 500,000. Calculating the death rate for
MDMA is more difficult. However, it is probably that not much different.  Is
playing sports in  high school like Russian roulette? No, but there are
risks.  

I concur with Seymour and Smith's endorsement of MDMA research.  We all need
more definite information so that people can more accurately decide for
themselves what level of risk is acceptible.

I really wanted to go,  but nobody was able to give me the directions
but then I would have needed a ride as well.

Is there ANY SFRaver that lives in Marin and has a car and that
would be willing to give the Crunchman a ride?    I'm really trying
very hard to get out more but with no car,  thats really impossible.

CAN ANYONE PLEASE HELP ME GET TO THESE GREAT PARTYS - "Not yelling"
just emphasizing the point...    I repeatedly ask for rides via the net
and get absolutly NO RESPONSE...  I know "Paper Tiger" is in Marin,
but he never is willing to give me rides,  probably because he never has
room in his car or he goes with someone else.    Is there anyone ELSE
in Marin that likes to go to raves who lives in Marin?

All very well and good, Bruce, but you still have not backed down from
saying -- outright -- that MDMA had nothing to do with all the recent
deaths in Britain.

I think that, unless other evidence is brought forward, we have to stipulate
that this the case.  The fact is, clinically, there is some (if very small)
risk of death from the use of MDMA.  And the reasoning of those who deny it
is suspect in the eyes of the media and, more importantly, among all of us
who are concerned with these issues, regardless of the cogency of the
argument put forth.

Actually Phred there are two sides to this coin that are just as stubborn:

The media says MDMA CAUSED the deaths.

Eisner says MDMA is as safe as aspirin ( which any reasonable person won't
believe and rightly so. )

Both are lost in their own hype which is a sad fact of the WOD.... two armies
sitting in their trenches each praying to the same God to help them win a
"just war"  and bring Motherhood and apple pie back to the table of all true
Americans....

  And of course, voices of reason such as yours which say very likely that
MDMA could have been one of the contributing factors.... which means that a
whole plethora of things went wrong including perhaps health risk factors,
heat, MDMA, lack of water, low blood sugar, poor overall health , other 
drugs being used etc. The truth if it were found ( but first it would 
have to be looked for and neither side is really looking for truth ) is
probably a combination INCLUDING MDMA use.

  I'm not willing to side with the media because that just fuels the morally
corrupt WOD. Nor will I take the position that MDMA is safe....


  But I do predict that the drug being used by too many ravers that will be
MOST regretted long after MDMA is forgotten is none other than TOBACCO.

That's jut the point. We don't know that MDMA was the cause of the deaths.
All we know is that it was present in the blood at the time of the deaths.
Most of the deaths had previously been attributed to "heatstroke."

Hey all

Well, decided at the last minute to run off to Spundae, not too bad all 
considering!  When I first got there, the vibe was kinda meat-markety, 
you know, all those big buff college guys who run around with no shirts 
on & perfect hair?  Bleah!  Not my style at all.  But there was a nice 
mixture of pretty cool people, including those i came with, that helped 
balance that out a bit.  The overall feel was pretty clubby, but for a 
club it was pretty good.  There were four rooms with varying kinds of 
music, my fave was the big back room with the serious deep house & 
lasers a-blazin.  Considering the number of people there, it wasn't too 
badly ventilated, altho it got awful hot while actually dancing.  One 
really nice thing about the place was the fact that it had a big patio 
in the back that was entirely outdoors & it was very cool & refreshing 
to just hang for a while after sweating up a big disgusting storm!  The 
chill room was pretty cool in its own way, fat leather (vinyl?) couches 
and a fireplace!  Talk about ambience!  The floor was not very well set 
up for sitting down on (no rugs, etc) but the couches (of which there 
were many) were really cool.  Later in the evening, 4 am or so, a 
really good vibe got going in the chill-room, everybody was dancing to 
the wacky shit they were playing, everything from disco-y stuff to rap 
to all kinds of nameless boogy music.  Took off about 5 am, feeling 
energetic & happy that I could go dance & have a good time after all, I 
was kind of unsure when i first showed up.  I guess it sort of depends 
on your expectations, I certainly had NO expectations of finding a 
Harmony or Chrysalis or whatever, so I obviously was not disappointed 
in that way.  In *this* kind of situation, all I really need is at 
least some of the people to be cool, & some really kick-ass music; if 
it gets me dancing in spite of myself, I'm usually ok.

See ya'll

Yes, the usual optomistic me is inspired to some criticism today.

After reflecting upon my weekend, I'd have to say that the highlight was 
teh new moon party simply because the crowd factor was ridiculous!

First of all there was Harmony - a really truely  great bunch of people - 
but the party was held in the Acme *again* and there were just TOO MANY 
PEOPLE - *AGAIN*!

Then SUnday night was Spundae and it was crazy the numbers of people in 
that building.  How the HELL can you have any kind of fun when you have 
to squeeze in and about through people to get anywhere and you are 
always getting stepped on or elbowed  or some big sweaty guy's back is 3 
inches from your face or some blonde's hair constantly swinging in your 
nose while you are trying to dance in a room where you can barely 
breathe because of too much smoke, heat and humidity?!?!?

I was nearly SICK just walking through the second floor of Harmony.  I 
just do not have fun in these kinds of conditions.  I mean all the 
people are really great as people, but as bodies, there are just too 
many!! I'm tired as hell of paying 10 - 15 bucks  only to sit all night 
long in a chill room to escape the crowds and heat.  That is not why I 
go to raves.  I go first and foremost to hear some great music on a nice 
sound system and to be able to DANCE.       

You know, I would much rather pay extra money for my ticket and have less 
people than pay only few dollars and have too many people.  The promoters 
have to get more people in when the ticket price is less so that they can
cover their costs. Am I not correct in assuming this?  I'm just 
*extremely* tired of this situation.

Bitch mode now off....

love,
Amy

And you do little to help the situation. Fighting propaganda with 
propaganda does little to get to the elusive truths. How do you know that 
the deaths attributed to MDMA in England were not at least in part due to 
the consumption of MDMA, and more importantly what medical credentials do 
you posses to make a definitve judgement?

It is not the place of the school to teach drug use or non-use. That job 
should be left up to the HOPEFULLY but not often enough well-informed 
*PARENT* It is they that are responsible for their children ultimately; 
not you, and certainly not the schools. There are a lot, a LOT of lies 
perpetrated by programs like D.A.R.E., however given the options of 
either teaching kids drug use, and scaring them into not using them, I 
choose the latter as the lesser of the two evils. How many children have you 
heard of that have died because the did *not* use an illicit substance?

"Buy my book, buy my book, BUY MY BOOK!" I for one get the fucking point of 
your thinly-veiled Eisner-mercial. I'm not buying your damn book, your 
bumper stickers, or anything else from you. At least have the decency to 
preface your self-promotion with the words BSP(Blatant Self-Promotion) in 
the title of the message.  

You are right, ignorance must be replaced by knowledge. You, like the 
anti-drug camp, have an agenda. You are not an unbiased source of 
information. Please do not attempt to pass yourself off as one. So I 
guess we can read your propaganda, read the anti-drug propaganda, and 
find once again that the truth is somewhere in the middle. Your 
"knowledge" like mine or anyone elses is tainted by your agenda.   

If anyone has half a brain, they will search out the truth for 
themselves, instead of mindlessly using your "truth" between the glossy 
covers as their source of information. Ultimately it is my health. 
my well-being, and my *LIFE* I'd be damned before I took you as an 
unbiased source of information or advised anyone to do the same.

A positive note for #

I am living proof that E can be used to quit harmful drug abuse.  I was 
a tabacoo smoker for 6 years smoking 10-15 cigs a day.  I tried 
nicotine patches as well as  will-power to quit on many occasions. But 
I could not seem to break the habit.  An E experience at the Gathering 
in 1994 enabled me to break the habit easily and without any withdrawl 
smptoms what-so-ever!

The night I quit was not planned either.  I went to the party without 
the slightest clue that I was about to stop smoking.  While it was 
definetly true that I wanted to rid the habit (as I had tried in the 
past) I still figured it would be a few years before I could.  Well, an 
amazing realization that night made it very clear why I was on this 
planet and very clear that cigarettes were not condusive to my mission. 
In an expression of joy I threw my fresh pack of smokes on the floor 
and shed the habit.

The amazing thing is that it has been so increadibly easy to quit!  I 
did not and have not fiended for a cigarette since than and felt no 
shakes, sickness, headaches or other physical symptoms the first weeks 
after I quit.  Infact I was on a very nice after-glow for some time.

This experience is just one of the many amazing and LIFE-Bennifiting 
experiences that I owe to this drug.  I will never in words be able to 
express the wonderful things it CAN do.  On the other hand I think the 
risks are quite obvious.  Particulary the fact that one does not KNOW 
what is in that pill.  Mainly for that reason I choose to refrain from 
it now.  The things I have learned will be with me and sobriety is the 
new teacher.

Hello all,

The good ole' Acme building.  Truly a most perfect place for a party.  
If only 200-300 people are going.  Any more than that and it just 
outright sucks.  All the small rooms are great for change of scenery 
but you can't enjoy it if its overcrowded.  

I'm not sure but I don't think promoters can afford to use the space 
unless the sell too many tickets.  Which is a bummer because a small 2 
or 300 person party there would truly be the bomb!

I will most likely do my best to avoide any partys at that site.  While 
I can't expect all promoters to give us the chance to know where the 
site is prior to buying tickets I would hope that Gateway, Fnf, 
Harmony, and any other Cool promoters begin to "warn" us if the site 
they secured is the infamous Acme building.  This might scare off many 
party-goers (like me) and thus leave a less crowded space.  Will you 
warn us?  

Thanks to Gateway and Harmony for the many wonderful parties you have 
thrown and will throw in the future.  Much love and respect.

love chris

  YOU GO GIRLIE GIRL!!!! i have to agree with your bitching;).
Remember how it was on NYE's. That place is a sweatboxxxx!
The people who seem to set out to through a great party also
seem to have no disregard for the partygoers safety. Acme can* almost* be a
comfortable and enjoyable space-remember Chrysalis-where maybe a 150-200
less people may have been more appropriate:). If some of these promoters
that plan to use ACME in the future are on this list perhaps; you should
consider out thoughts on this subject: I don't think that Amy and I are 
going to be the last to voice out concerns about ACME.

                                                     HUGS-

the planet; anyone for Death Valley, the music when I was there was toooooo
slow(a little faster than Lift, but still Softhouse/Techno); hurts my body
to move sooooo, it had the overall charm of a Ken, Barbie and their friends
Frat party; less the vomit.

        Well has a pretty bad night overall for me anyway. The fact that I
tried something different & powdered than my usual; at a friends request to
sample might of had something to do with it. I consummed one standard
capular helping and after I got over feeling sick, on a empty stomach to, I
basically felt like I wanted to kill, kill, kill, I wanted to see blood
vains gore & guts in my teeth; sorta like Arlo G. This was to say an extreme
& unusual reaction. Never before had this ever happened, I was transformed
from mild mannered Brian DarknEs^2 into teeth grinding negative person. I
must have taken powered rage/jerk or something, thank god it only lasted for
an hour awful stuff try and stay away from it, cause you just never know
what your going to get in the powdered form. Needless to say I have one
ahhhhh, less friend today.

Dear Friends & Family,

On Mon, 19 Feb 1996 Black Adder shared (in part):

> How many children have you 
> heard of that have died because they did *not* use an illicit substance? 

And I would like to venture in response that comparing the number of 
adolescent deaths from Exstasy to the number of adolescent suicides each 
year might provide, if not a direct answer, at least a further question: 
 
How many of those young people might have found, like our own Brian 
Darkness (not that he was necessarily suicidal) new reason to live had they 
been able to try this drug?  

Unfortunately there is no way to keep such statistics, so we'll never 
know, but my feeling is that the possibility of lives saved should not be 
overlooked in this discussion of the value or merits of MDMA.
	
For the record, I do not have any financial or other stake in the matter 
other than that of a satisfiEd customer.  :)

Much love,
				<<< Starchild >>>

you know I have no problem with people discussing the pro's & cons, or
debating about the merits/non merits of a specific substance, but I feel
that PERSONAL drug stories of how you did powder vs. the regular etc... and
your teeth ground up is bullshit. 
 
this is not the forum to discuss our PERSONAL drug stories. I think we
should be careful to keep the responsibility of our posts to more of a
debate aspect, and less of a personal nature...........not every one who is
on sfraves wants to hear about what drugs I do or how I react to them, I
just think we should realize that this forum is being read by more than
just sfraves..........as some-one pointed out our posts are public domain
and can be seen by any-one with a knowledge of how to  manipulate a
computer (re-government etc.....) 
 
I am not preaching, just trying to keep the nature or our family
intact........moonpup

        So what are you really saying Moonpup. Are you saying the #, is not
part of raving or Techno. Does this mean that we shouldn't take about Smart
Drinks, Dancing, Circle Dancing, ...etc, either for they would end up in the
same vain? Please clarify your post & it's intentions because it leaves at
least me a little confused about just what you do mean.

Because it's 1.5 hrs from the mountians which means snowboarding, and it's
1.5 hrs from the City which means music.  It's the perfect local....not to
mention it costs like half as much as living in the bay area.....

Oh, that's why I live in Sac.....you were asking about Amy.......Well I
don't know the answer to that.

Spundae said that Jam and Spoon were performing live.  Actually, it
was the female vocalist from Jam and Spoon only.  Hey, who needs
to fly out those crazy Germans to tweak their synths when you have
a vocalist who can sing just as well over DAT who lives right here in
SF!

Now, I don't mind live perfomances with some DAT in them... but a completely
canned perfomance is kind of unforgivable.  They had two guys with keyboards
and an acoustic guitar air-banding to the music.  One of the keyboards looked
like one of those toy ones you get at Circuit City.  The least they
could have done was plug the keyboards in so it might just acutally look
like they were performing.  The big keyboard had no Audio or MIDI connections..
the toy keyboard did not have they power plugged in.  Again, at least
they could have put a scant amount of effort into making it look sorta
real.  Saying "Jam and Spoon performing live" was an extreme lie by
Spundae.

Mad last night was 100% better.  A nice, clean, non-smokey, cool room
with lotsa blacklights and cool video projections... a clean sound system...
and great music!  A live perfomance offered by... by... well, I forgot
who exactly was performing, but it was really cool.  Probably better than
a real Jam and Spoon show would have been.  So many cool people I knew showed
up for Mad, including a ton of SFravers.  Of course this great of a
club does come at a price... a whopping three dollars :)  I can't imagine
a better way to end my weekend.

Neither is the bay area.  Although I enjoy spending time there, I would not
want to live there.

Well, my reply to Christina was sent privately, but since a few of you 
have been speculating as to why I live here vs. there, I shall go ahead 
and post it to the list. Hope you don't mind....

> Amy, why do you live in sacramento?

Well, because I have to finish college.  I live with my parents and go to 
sac state - by living at home it saves me ALOT of money and right now I'm 
saving so that when I graduate in December I can move to SF.  Believe me, 
it is tough to go home when I feel like my real home is over there.  Most 
of my friends are there and I am there 2 or 3 weekends a month.  By the 
time I finish school and begin looking for work, not to mention FINDING a 
job before I graduate, and finding roomates (which is already starting to 
happen) and finding a place to live with them, the time is actually going 
to fly!!  I'll be down again this weekend for the F&F daytime party!

love,
Amy

Please do not take my comments as a comdemnation of Ecstacy. Far from it. 
However, I think that institutionalized drug classes are a very, VERY bad 
idea, and have no place in an educational system. An individual student 
being able to go to a counselor or some such person and getting honest, 
un-biased information, yes. Teaching drug-use to an entire population, no.  
There are a lot of people out there that simply should not take drugs.

And how many would have been saved from seeking professional help? If we 
are getting tangental we might also want to include those unquantifiable 
numbers in our discussion.

I would never, ever, deny that use of MDMA has changed many peoples lives 
for the better, including my own. However, Bruce Ehrlichs self-important 
suggestion that his book be used as a text book in schools which teach 
children to use drug was the issue. In my opinion, a very poor suggestion 
indeed...

Subject: it's cleaning time again!

please redistribute this important information to everyone likely to
be impacted by this event.


 *** Attention ***

 It's that time again!

 As many of you know, each leap year the internet must be shut down for 24
 hours in order to allow us to clean it.  The cleaning process, which
 eliminates dead email and inactive ftp, www and gopher sites, allows for
 a better-working and faster internet.

 This year, the cleaning process will take place from 12:01 a.m. GMT on
 Feb. 29 until 12:01 a.m. GMT on March 1.  During that 24-hour period,
 five powerful internet-crawling robots situated around the world will
 search the internet and delete any data that they find.

 In order to protect your valuable data from deletion we ask that you do
 the following:

 1.  Disconnect all terminals and local area networks from their internet
 connections.

 2.  Shut down all internet servers, or disconnect them from the internet.

 3.  Disconnect all disks and hardrives from any connections to the
internet.

 4.  Refrain from connecting any computer to the internet in any way.

 We understand the inconvenience that this may cause some internet users,
 and we apologize.  However, we are certain that any inconveniences will
 be more than made up for by the increased speed and efficiency of the
 internet, once it has been cleared of electronic flotsam and jetsam.

 We thank you for your cooperation.

 Interconnected Network Maintenance staff

 Sysops and others:  Since the last internet cleaning, the number of
 internet users has grown dramatically.  Please assist us in alerting the
 public of the upcoming internet cleaning by posting this message where
 your users will be able to read it.  Please pass this message on to other
 sysops and internet users as well.  Thank you.

Where/when is this happening?  I'd love to put that on my "have-to-be-there"
list for this weekend!

And thanks to all who gave me ideas and info on Seattle for last weekend, esp.
Tigger from The Stranger (sorry, I lost your email address!) for the tip about
Transcend, which was a small, sweaty fest where it turns out about 20 of my
Seattle friends were, and we grooved all night (at least until around 5:30 when
the cops came and I left!)  My friend Rebecca says she thinks she knows who you
are, but didn't see you there, were you there?

Hi Leslie!  I'm glad ya made it to Transcend.  I heard it was quite fun,
albeit somewhat sweaty!  =)  Alas, the dreaded raver cold/flu thang kept me
from going out.  I had pushed myself over the edge on the previous weekend
doing visuals for One Love in Portland.

What did you think of the party?  The music, dj's?  I'd be interested to
hear your impressions.

Peace and love from the city of brilliant raindrops

I think that all of the promoters and partygoeres in the scene pretty much
agree that Acme sucks.  It's too small, it's too hot, it costs too much,
etc. etc.
However, the reason why it keeps on getting used is because quite simply,
there are no other spaces. The only place that you can legally throw a
non-2000 person rave is at a club, where you have to serve alcohol or
charge $20 a head, which a lot of people are unwilling to do. Until Da
Mayor makes good on his campaign promises to make it easier to get permits
(his son is a hip-hop DJ), promoters are stuck with the Acme, and other
small,  hot, illegal venues.  Not that illegality is really that bad, but
you try convincing the owner of a warehouse to let you throw an all night,
illegal, loud, drug-ridden party at his space.  Oh well, space availability
(like everything else), comes in waves, so maybe soon a whole bunch of
spaces will open up, and everyone will live happily ever after.

Brian, 
 
if you want a more clear view of what I am saying........simply put..... 
 
I don't give a fuck what lousy drugs you do or did !!!!! nor do I wish to
hear about it.   (I can only speak for myself of course), and why do you
insist on talking about personal drug experiences on sfraves. 
While we all know that raving CAN involve drugs, it doesn't mean it HAS to.

 
It's posts like yours that make us all look like we are a drug induced
community, we are not.........and even if we were........that kind of talk
should be kept private, or discussed in a more responsible manner....I'm
sorry, I am new to sfraves, maybe I'm out of line.........but I just feel
we have many many subjects that relate to the rave scene that are not drug
related..........as far as debating the pro's and cons of a specific
drug.........i.e.... M.D.M.A.....this is far more appropriate, than
discussing PERSONAL experiences........and good and bad drug stories, If
you are having trouble understanding my post, perhaps you should do less
drugs..........sorry I had to say it!!! 
 
As far as smart drinks, dancing, and dance circles, what the fuck is the
coralation to your post about your bad experience of drugs.....or my post
stating that it's not the wisest thing to be talking about..........That
makes no sense to me.......don't get so defensive, just use your COMMON
SENSE......... 
 
I feel I'm getting too negative in my post about not talking about personal
drug experiences........can some-one else shed light on this
subject.......after all isn't one of the rules of sfraves......NO DRUG
TALK.........is debate about drugs DRUG TALK, or is it merely
debate.........HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND OUR POSITION........moonpup

sorry if my posts seemed hostile, I was probably a little out of
line.....I'm interested in hearing about many different things that relate
to rave lifestyle too, I guess it just seemed rather odd to hear about
someones bad drug experience (of the night before) 
 
I guess if it had related to an old story that had a point to make, or had
meaning in the form of "and the moral of the story is" etc.....I could see
justify-ing a drug related story.......... but to just blurt out that you
had bad drugs the night before, doesn't seem to say much......after all, we
all from time to time have done good and bad drugs....but I feel each of us
do different drugs for our own different reasons. It's of a personal
nature, not something to be discussed amonsgt 450 people + 
 
.... I mean if we all posted how our drug experiences were every weekend, I
would feel we had taken a bad turn somewhere. However it is somewhat a
subject that relates to the rave lifestyle, so I apologize to Brian and any
other SFRaver who I have insulted, if my post seemed to be of a negative
nature....it was not my intention to be so critical or closed minded to the
feelings of the rest of you.....I humbly ask your forgiveness 
 
and as far as rules..........your right .....there are no rules....are
there ??? sorry again....

Hi all!

	I've been in the south bay area for about a year now, but I haven't
had the time to go out much on the weekends until lately, and none of
my current friends are into the rave scene, so....

	I wanted to go to teknotica last Sat, but never got a call back
about where/how much/etc. Can anyone suggest upcoming raves for someone with
interests like mine:

	Hard trance/hard techno - BPM over everything else
	Detroit

Actually, I guess most types (except ambient) are OK, but those are my two
favorites. Thanks for any help people can give me, and I hope to start
meeting some of you in person (I'm a very tall light skinned italian,
and I tend to favor fairly skimpy leather gear - if you see a girl with a
stylized "S" branded on her rear end, it's me)

		Thanks!

			Marisa

This one was great! I have only been to a half dozen raves or so, but
this was the best yet. Everyone was friendly and open and I really had
a great time. It was super hot, causing me to spend more time in the
chill room than usual, but that was okay. I appreciated the Hamony
peoples efforts to make the extra exits available. Even with someone
there to open the garage door in an emergency, that building could
get hairy to exit. Thanks to all of you who went for making it a great
experience and special thanks to those who put it on. The time spent
on signs/decorations/etc really made a difference.

Moonpup asks:
>and as far as rules.......your right .....there are no rules....are
>there ???

There are a set of guidelines issued to all who join the sfraves
mailing list.  The only hard "rule" that I can think of is that the
list not be used to carry out blatently illegal activities (i.e.
drug dealing).  But even this rule gets bent on a regular basis,
since many of the raves promoted here can be considered illegal.

Sfraves is mostly self-governing, with Brian Behlendorf, owner of
the hardware, as the final arbitrator of the activities here.
He can be reached at brian@hyperreal.com.

The debate of what exactly is approprite to post here is a
neverending one.  A lot of people use filters on their mailers to
block out the posts of certain people, or with certain strings in
the subject header.  Others just use the "delete" key alot.

In my view, there will always be people who abuse the live-and-let-live 
nature of this list.  People who talk about specific time and places
where they buy and sell drugs is one example of abuse, IMO.  People
who *habitually* blather on about non-rave-related personal issues
is another.  Most of us can sense when we're pissing people off, so
things rarely get of hand.  Allowing for the abuse of freedom is one 
of the prices we pay for it.

hey everyone,

  four nights going out.  i dont usually post but thought id
give a brief opinion on the four parties

Harmony:  I was upset that Terry Mullan was not spinning, since
 he rocked my world at the gathering, but a good party after
 4 am when the place cleared out a bit.  It was too jammed
 before then.  I loved Harry Who's set. Who is this guy!?!
 book him more please!

Organic:  A good party. not amazing, but good. DJ Dan was Dan.
 But DJ Sneak was amazing period.  The most interesting set
 i have heard spun in a long time. i loved the way he just
 took control of the vibe and made it work his way.

Spundae: another good party. Mark Lewis from LA was my favorite
 dj of the night. but it was also cool the vartiety of music that
 was available.  and i had never been to 1015 before.  Big props
 to the sound (except in the bottom room) for being not to loud
 (MY POOR EARS!!)

Mad: Was nice also.  has not had the crazy fun vibe for a few 
 weeks now.  Andy;s set was really good.
 i really like the new music.


but enough parting for me until Derrick May comes to town :)

peace all and take care,

	Most any place that is not run for Djs or people looking for
techno (or not run by people who like techno and therefore do not
understand how much shit is out there and how picky one's ear can be to
it...) seems to have stopped letting people drop needles on records before
buying them.  Many of these places give you a full 50% - 80% when you
return vinyl that has been played once. Rasputin's in Berkeley (last
summer) said they were tired of vinyl going to waste because people who 
scratch it while listening - so I asked them to drop needles on it for me 
and they chuckled. Now, after watching a large stock of vinyl sit, get 
old, and warpin the heat, I hear you can listen at pre-arranged times... 
I wonder if their little scam didn't work out...

Ins and outs don't work. All the people going in and out would attract the

Thank you new moon kids.  The opening ritual by Guillermo, Raphael and Dale
really grounded the energy.  Todd & Heather gave us an organic juice bar. 
It was yummy.  A lot of love went into the party, thank you everyone.  The
generosity of everyone covered our costs, & that felt really good.  We
don't mean to be elitist, we didn't post the # to avoid an ACME crowd
situation.  Our # is (415)267-3076.  Call each new moon to find out what's
going on.  Next month we'll probably hold a small outdoor ritual.  Love to
everyone, especially Ann & Gregg.  You make it happen.   
 
Love & Peace

There are some pictures from actual new moon parties up on hyperreal.

There is also some stuff about the party, it's history and so on.  

Enjoy!!!

Also, I have loads of pictures from the party that I've taken..some of 
these are what's up on hyperreal.  When I get some spare time we'll put 
more of them up.

Hello
I know the general etiquette is to wait a couple of weeks before posting 
but the reason I joined is that my mate Rob is coming over to your part of 
the world next Wednesday.

Background :
Rob is a DJ from Leeds, England (he works under the name DJ RAW) and he 
plays mental hard and slinky psychedelic trance (my review). He's looking 
for places to play and good record shops I guess so if any of you can point 
him in the right direction he would be most grateful. If anyone would like 
a copy of his last demo tape (which is absolutely mental (again my review) 
) I would be more than happy to sort out a copy for you

Cheers in advance
toy mark

that? Bob replied, yes of course I am can't you tell I'm weird officer, and
at that moment they entered the jail.......

Part 2, JAIL:

        The officer chuckled at Bob's comment as the 3 made their way
through the dark maze like halls which are 850 Bryant Street, the Hall of
Injustice.
    
        The first stop, the super breatalizer room. Where Bob once again had
to blow into the tube twice so that they could double double check to see if
Bob was drunk on alcohol. Or just it case to see if he had drank some in the
back of the police cruiser on the way, no doubt. Bob twice again blew two
big zero's, and received more perplexed looks of disappointment & dismay
from the two officers.

        The three then proceeded down the hall to an area where Bob was to
be unhand cuffed and given more sobriety testing once again. Once again Bob
complied with their repeated inane requests of counting out loud, guessing
when 30 seconds had pasted, standing on one foot while having his eyes
closed & touching his nose & ...etc. Once again Bob seemed to pass all the
tests, yet no indication was given even at his request.

        The officer then proceeded to take my pulse and blood pressure to
see if it was elevated from the so called speed or cocaine Bob had taken.
Bob's BP and pulse were taken sitting, standing, & on both arms the results
being pretty much the same; 110/70 pulse 80. Bob responded with tremendous
glee, pretty high officer for someone doing speed or cocaine; his comment
reeking of sarcasm. Another perplexed, and dismayed look filled both
officers eye's.

        Bob was then told to either submit to a piss or a blood test, his
choice or be fined and/or banned from operating a motor vehicle in the state
of California for up to a year. Regarding the choice of tests Bob thought to
himself, are they for real, I get a choice, hehe, I'll take the piss test
responded Bob, but only if I have to. The officer once again looked dismayed
and perplexed and said that because we know your doing drugs you have no
choice Bob, it's either one or the other. Bob thought ok, but hell if I'm
going to give them my blood. Shit they can tell way more info with that than
they can my urine, and chances are nothing has metabolized yet.

        So Bob, along with the male officer walked into room that smelled
like human feces, containing a toilet that had seemed like it had never ever
been cleaned, yuk. Of course due to Bob's nervousness he couldn't go to the
bathroom. So the male officer while watching turned on the facet which
started the water flowing, which the sound of, according to the officer
helped people pee. It worked and Bob proceeded to pee. They usually tell you
so that you can prevent/minimize contaminants to allow the stream to start
and then place the tiny glass container into the stream for collection. Bob,
being the smart ass that he is, placed the container clumsily and
immediately in front of the stream. Then handing the wet container back to
the officer, here ya go said Bob, adding after the officer received the
container, in a serious tone, but secretly joking with him, Bob made the
statement, oh by the way my Doctor thinks I have HIV, the officer then
almost dropped the urine.

        They then proceed to the next stop, the body search room. Bob and
the male officer entered another disgusting room with no place to sit down
and Bob was asked to take off all his clothes, everything. Bob complied and
sneered at the officer. Bob removed his clothes, & while standing there butt
naked the officer asked him to turn around and of course bend over. Bob once
again complied while hearing the latex glove go snap. There was a moment of
pain and Bob was told to get dressed again less his boots, belt, hair tie
...etc, leaving him with his red shirt, & black vinyl plants. Bob was then
instructed to sit on a bench with about 10 prostitutes, while they went
through his belongings.

        The property people seemed to be having the time of their lives with
Bob's stuff, holding up the collar and leash making barking noises. Bob was
later told he made the SF Police's property departments night for having the
most unusual stuff. Bob of course took great pride in this, it being SF and
everything.

        It was about 6am when Bob was then taken to the drunk tank and
remained there to about 8:30am. It must have been a busy night because both
holding and drunk tanks were filled with about 30 people each. These cells
were also disgustingly dirty with jail roaches so brave they just walked
around where ever, & when ever, E-Bee Milton would have loved it. Bob shared
the cell with the very charming company of 30 or so men ranging from a
freak(Bob), a suit, to a few gays, to homeless people with lice on them,
lovely. Bob however was asked if he wanted breakfast, Bob responded what ya
got; the guard responded jail food boy. Ahhh no thanks, replied Bob, like he
was supposed to know what jail food was.

        Around 8:30am everyone was moved to the holding & processing cell,
that was just as gross as the other cell, roaches included. Then a fight
almost broke out between two men. The fight was over the fact that the one
man hand accidently woken up the other, Bob thought to himself, ahhh this
must be the entertainment for the morning. The experience was begriming to
way on Bob, he had to keep saying to himself that, I know I'm getting out
soon, repeatedly.

        After about an hour in there Bob was requested to come to the final
processing area where he was finger printed and had mug shots taken. Note, I
will be happy to post copies to the net to interested parties when I get
them back. After that Bob was given back his stuff, his nice leather
backpack with the alien sticker on it torn by the officers and unusable,
thinking to himself, fuckers I'll eat them alive in court. He was then
handed a summons and a court date stating his MISDEMEANORS charges and are
as follows:

1.     R201168 01621613 BKD 23152(A) VC/M;NOW 23152(A)VC/M;

        Court date 2/01/95:

        Bob walked out of the police station turned around and proceeded to
flip the station the bird, and got into a cab heading to Oak Town in order
to retrieve his friends car; which he did successfully, but $160.00

        Make sure you stay tuned for the exciting & climatic conclusion to

To everyone who went to Harmony:

I love you all!!!  Thanks so much for making this one of the best parties
of my short raving life (started in September '94, at a Jeremiah party).
To everyone I met, I'm glad to have you in the family, and hope/know we'll
see each other again.  Sorry I wasn't more talkative, but I found myself
way too blissful to speak at times.  I could barely get myself to dance!
Then there was the heat...but we've all heard plenty about that.
One young guy told a friend that I (of all people) was the one who inspired
him to embrace the "scene", and that made me feel soooooo gooooood!  All of
you, even those I didn't meet, contributed to a very beautiful vibe, and so
much love & happiness that I'm still glowing! :)  I'm glad people liked my
SHROOMARAMA shirt, and my butterfly.  Thanks to a beautiful person who came
to us in the chill room early on, and gifted us with candy, toys, and
stickers.  I put a glittery heart on my butterfly, and felt that it
represented the inner me, shining my heart out for everyone in the center
of my butterfly, which is my metamorphosis into a beacon of love for
everyone!  Am I too happy or what?
See y'all next time...

Love & stuff,

Try to convince him he really doesn't want it. Really. It's a super cheese
casio preset house track that throws all of the vocals from the original
over the top. It can sound ok mixed over something else, but on it's own
it's a bit lacking. It came out on white label, but I haven't seen any
around for a month or so. They did have 'em at Primal along with an even
cheesier house remake of some Doors song. Man, whoever did that Led
Zeppelin mix had no idea what he was starting.

For the definitive house/techno mix of "Sweet Dreams..." check the
Nightmare mix from 1991.

But then again, what do I know? Everyone seem to go crazy whenever it's
played. Just wait for my jungle remix of ABBA's "Dancing Queen"

Hmm this saddens me to see people complaining and accusing moonpup of being
negative, perhapse he seems negative because he remembers how much love
and respect sfravers use to show to each other and the community at large.

Moon was one of the first sfraves DJ's, he played the VERY FIRST SFRAVES
RAVE (ConneXion 1 at Bonnie Doon) and I believe he played ConneXion 2 at the
marina as well.

When will folks start living this PLUR that is so bantered about here?

Shit!  And here I am at the New Moon party, early in the morning, yanking
his shorts while he's DJing!  Sorry Moonpup, I had no idea.  You must work
on your austere, self-righteous DJ persona, my man, otherwise people might
actually think you're just a cool guy who can spin records.  ;^)

Thanks for the great sets...Versatility and personality go a long way!

:^)

P.S.  Both Joe Rice and Moonpup played dance sets and ambient sets at the
New Moon party...

Interesting to note the long-standing ritual use of plant based
psychedelics in other cultures.

(this note forwarded without permission and without attribution)...

------- Forwarded Message

Tryptamines are a class of indole-ethanamine compounds (thus organic)
which are reknown for some of them being  potent hallucinogens. The
neurotransmitter serotonin is also a tryptamine. The most common (and
perhaps potent) hallucinogenic form is DMT (dimethyltryptamine or
N,N-dimethyl-1H-indole-3-ethanamine) .

Tryptamine  and DMT and its derivatives are naturally occurring
compounds. DMT, aMT, 5-OMe-DMT, beta carbolines, and bufotenine are
found in a variety of South American plants including species of
Myristicaceae (Virola species), Fabaceae (Anadenanthera or piptadenia
peregrina, Mimosa hostilis), Zygophillaceae (Pegonum harmala),
Malpighiaceae (Banisteriopsis species, Tetrapteris methystica),
Rubiaceae (Psychotria species) Apocyanaceae (Restonia amazonica), and
Acanthaceae (Justicia pectoralis).  Psilocin and psilocybin are
tryptamine derivatives and are found in many varieties of
hallucinogenic mushrooms. (Psilocybe, Gymnopilus, Panoeolus, Conocybe,
and Strophorius)

Ayahuasca is from a plant of the species Banisteria (Banisteriopsis
rusbyana). Banisteriopsis and Psychotria leaves are used to make a
hallucinogenic (or narcotic) drink known as ayahuasca (uasca), caapi,
yaje, or cipo in northern South American. The principal active
compounds are the alkaloid carbolines harmine, 3,4-dihydroharmine
(harmaline), and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroharmine.

Virola snuff is known as yakee and yato in Columbia and parica, epena,
and nyakwana in Brazil. Anadenanthera snuff if known as cohaba and yopo
in the West Indies and  South American.  Mimosa hostilis roots are used
to make an hallucinogenic drink known as ajuca and vinho de Jurema in
eastern Brazil.    Bufotenine is also present in the skin glands and
venoms of frogs and toads of the genera Hyla, Letodactylus, Rana, and
Bufo and may be ingested if these creatures are licked, chewed, or
swallowed (a la Beavis and Butthead).

The hallucinogenic indolealkylamines have properties in common with
LSD, serotonin, (5-hydroxy- tryptamine), ergotamine, and
beta-carbolines (harmine). The pyrrole portion of the indole ring is
conjectured to be key to their hallucinogenic activity. These compounds
appear to act primarily by stimulating serotonin type 2 (5HT2)
receptors. Some compounds are partial 5HT receptor agonists or mixed
agonist-antagonists. They also can stimulate dopaminergic and
tryptaminergic receptors as well as inhibit  monoamine oxidases. 
Though these latter properties appear to be less important in their
pharmacological activity.

I would just like to say that I am glad that you have sparked another 
discussion  related to this topic.  No matter how many times it comes up, 
I like to hear about what people say.  It is a learning experience all 
the way around.  To ignore the juxtoposition of raves and ecstasy is 
silly.  I enjoyed the debate that both sides(for lack of a better word) put 
on, and have emerged with more conclusions of my own.

He he! A friend of mine and I tried this very thing a while back! Actually,
it wasn't at all interesting until we pushed her signature ear-bleed highs
down three octaves; then it sounded remarkably like a dog howling in pain.

tony, 
 
you know its funny you said that about the new eurithmics song, I too have
been humming it.......it must be because every one is talking about it. 
 
I have to admit I thought it was just O.K when I heard it the first time at
the record store, and all the pressings had a warp in them, so I didn't get
it at first,  but it is infectious and crowds love it.....it is very
popular this month, I had to go back and get it because I thought it would
play well..........its actually very simple but the arrangement is top
notch (intro time/vocal breakdowns?etc..) however it is a rather simple
track by todays standards, it just goes to show ya! simplicity can be the
key sometimes.........

Here's another two cents: my impression (based on experiences and friends
relating their experiences) is that with MDMA, just as with many things,
the risk lies more in what elements or circumstances are combined with the
substance.  There was a guy in England who was partying, had taken e, was
drinking alcohol, and was dancing hard for a long time.  His friends warned
him, but he bopped till he dropped.  The only thing I've witnessed that
could be considered a risk with MDMA is that it makes some people retch,
due to sensitive stomachs.  But that was the extent of the negative aspect
of their experience.  People often combine other substances with it, and
that is definitely risky.  My dad wouldn't appreciate having his words used
to validate my point of view, but he says that, in almost everything in
life, "Moderation is the key."  I'm not saying anything that everyone else
hasn't read or thought of already, but I couldn't resist getting into it.
I seriously doubt that, if the people mentioned earlier in this discussion
who died had moderated their intake, and conducted themselves with a little
caution, they would have died at all.  No substance other than possibly all
the stuff we breathe ever day is ever going to kill me, because I've
decided not to get myself into such a position.  It's really pretty easy.
I've rambled enough for now.  Thanks!

If Whitney Houston is more your speed DJ, SS made a jungle song that 
samples "I will always love yooooouuuuu". As much as the original drove 
me towards insanity, I must say I like his track. I believe it was on 
Black (DJ SS plates are are distinguished by color)

As far as gabba remixes, I'm quite fond of the 'remix' of "On My 
Radio" by The Selector. Pogo-ska-gabba-madness-at-78-rpm.

     For anyone caught in that loop -- unable to keep a melody from
returning and returning, unbidden -- check out Arthur C. Clarke's *Tales
from the White Hart*, "The Ultimate Melody." It's about a man who notices
that there are always "catchy" tunes that seem to weasel their way into
our consciounness, so he sets out to find out their common elements and
create "The Ultimate Melody."  He succeeds, but.... 
    And -- just for Tony Rotundo -- the tale ends with "La 
Ronde."  :<)

Simplicity, ya that reminds me awhile ago I got my hands on Carl Craig's
remix of The Climax-that is IMO one the nicest examples of a simple and
almost haunting track.  The keybords towards the end are sooo nice!

SEEya,

I'll have to throw in a word of support with regards to this as well.  The
venerable Moonpup has contributed his share of good vibes and support for
the groover community here in Seattle. I remember his wonderful sets and
pleasant occassional short conversations with him years ago when he was
here visiting.

Moonpup, folx up here are still wondering when you'll be coming back for a
visit.  Please do so sometime!  =)

   This all reminds me of a sick game a few co-workers and I used to play 
   at least once a week:  At the beginning of the day, we'd try to stick a 
   sick song, soundtrack, tv theme song, etc. into another's brain by 
   casually mentioning it, whistling it, playing it, or singing it, etc. 
   knowing full and well, it'd drive them crazy until they were able to 
   shake it loose.
   
   Upon this sick and happy note, I'll sign off a la Doris Day:

tony, 

you know its funny you said that about the new eurithmics song, I too have been 
humming it.......it must be because every one is talking about it. 

I have to admit I thought it was just O.K when I heard it the first time at 
the record store, and all the pressings had a warp in them, so I didn't get 
it at first,  but it is infectious and crowds love it.....it is very 
popular this month, I had to go back and get it because I thought it would 
play well..........its actually very simple but the arrangement is top 
notch (intro time/vocal breakdowns?etc..) however it is a rather simple 
track by todays standards, it just goes to show ya! simplicity can be the 
key sometimes.........

The thing that used to excite me about DJs at raves was how they could
turn me on to music that took me to wonderful new places.  There is so 
much new great music out there, and there are so many artists who can
sample older stuff and manipulate it in a way that makes it fresh 
and interesting.  I wouldn't put the "new" mix of Sweet Dreams in
that category.

Yeah, nostalgia always plays well.  Like cute babies.  Blech.
C'mon Moonpup, don't pander to the lowest common denominator of
human emotions.  It's just too easy.  Propel me into orbit (like
you've done so many times), not back to some stale memories of MTV.

Pick up the new/latest Mouse on Mars: "Iaora Tahiti".  I'm thoroughly 
impressed with it.
As the title suggests, its got a lot of caribbean and pacific island 
influences, which I think is a rather refreshing style to base an ambient 
album  around.

p.s. Anyone know anything about the group "Muslimgauze"?  I'm intrigued 
by their cool-looking album covers, but have no firsthand info about them.

I was on my way TO the store when I saw it. Really cool how you could see
the blackness on the whole moon against the twilight sky. Whatever was above
it must have been a planet (Venus) it was too bright to be anything else
(The Mothership?)

Doc Martin -- West Coast -- Volume 5

I just read about this CD in URB or FIX (can't remember) last night so I
went out today and bought it.

If you like Doc's house style, you'll like this.

FYI- I am not really that into "house" myself, being an acid trance/
psychotrance/ hard techno enthusiast, but I like Doc's style so I went for
it... and I like it!

When I am unable to get a tune out of my head, I think of the theme from 
Sanford and Son.  If you kno that tune, it will drive out any other tune 
in your head.  

BTW does anyone have a copy of that song (on any medium)?  I have found a 
lot of TV show themes in my travels, but never that one... hmmm...
Anyone interested in helping with an acid trance version....? :D

I believe that the star was Jupiter.  There was this guy in Santa Cruz 
who used to park his car downtown and set up his telescopes for people to 
look at the moon and also Jupiter.  If I remember right, they were always 
very close to each other in the sky just like tonight.

You were right, it was beautiful!

Subject: CABIN update: Need your input
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

O.K. then kiddies, we're set for the 16th!  Next step: find cabin.  Well for
the most part things are running slightly higher than I predicted, but, I've
found the following three deals via internet.  What I need is your input as
to how much we want to spend.  Please note these are the best deals I've
found. they're smokin, and are not neccesarily available for the 16th, so
dont get hopes up yet.  Think of these as examples, I'm trying to get a feel
for what everyone would like to get out of this trip.
** OPTION A: (The Mac Daddy Package)***    California Vacation Rental 4
bdrm,3,900 square ,TV, VCR,lavishly furnished,sleeps 16,Three Fireplaces, Wet
Bar, Solarium ,Indoor 275 Gallon Spa ,at the base of heavenly,Two Master
Suites both with lava rock Fireplace, wicker love seat and TV ,450 Square
foot rec. room: Pool Table, computer, electronic dart board,  video games
etc. RATES: $300/Daily 
*****This is the most expensive, but an incredible deal for the $,   assuming
we had 30 people (& assuming we could get away with this here) it would only
be $20/person(cool), however, if many cancel it MAY be up to
$35/person(hmm)***

***** OPTION B: (The Player Package)***    "Mountain Waterfront Retreat"
California Vacation Rental 
This professionally decorated, 2900 square foot, waterfront vacation home is
located in the Tahoe  Keys, a private waterfront community(this could be bad,
dunno). private boat dock and spa This 2 story vacation home is 9 years old
and accommodates up to 10 persons. 3 Bedrooms, Wet Bar, Jetted Bathtub, Wood
Burning Stove * 3 Cable TV's, VCR,
Minimum two Night stay:      $250/Nightly
*****Once again, a smokin deal for the $$, assuming we had 30 people (&
assuming we could get away with this here)it would only be $17/person(very
cool), however, if many cancel, it MAY be up to $30/person(mmhmm)***

******OPTION C: The Econo-Pimp Package********
"South Tahoe Chalet"South Lake Tahoe, California 
ID#CAVca/tahoe1 California Vacation Rental 
This vacation home sleeps 16 persons. 5 Bedrooms and 2 Bathrooms. *Cable TV ,
VCR, Stereo,*Fireplace  ,Deck, Yard, BBQ  RATES: $800/Weekly except for
Holidays
Winter: $175/Nightly Summer: $150/Nightly
There is a $50 cleaning fee 
(Note, there is no spa : (, bathtub creativity required)
*********** Obviously the cheapest, assuming we had 30 people it would only
be $15/person(very cool), however, if more cancel, it MAY be up to
$25/person(mmhmm)***

*Once again, I've got over 50 people on my list still, but I predict I may
not see half that in checks, it may be safest to plan on getting stuck with
the highest $ amount to avoid dissapointment.  So please, please, please drop
me a VERY SHORT note (TODAY) as to which option you would prefer and can
afford. (remeber these 3 are optimum samples and we will probably not be
lucky enough to get one of these exact places.) 

P.s.  The list has been updated, people have been added, : ) and a couple
cant make it. : [   Remeber, those that I've recently added on the list, I
cannot absolutely guarantee a space.  However, since I need to make
reservations asap, I'll have to accept the first checks that get here.
 BETTER SEND THEM TODAY to avoid dissapointment.  I suppose the best thing to
do would be send $20 (check) for now, to show intent, but if (the majority)
opt for the more expensive package, I may have to ask for more.  Thanks

Love and Anticipation,
Steveo
Any Questions, call me 916.443.8225
checks to Steven Ogden, 1901 G. Street #1, Sacramento, CA 95814    P.S.
Please write "Cabin Reimbursement" in the "notes" section so my accountant
doesn't shoot me.

Last thing, if anyone has spare time, please cruise the web for cabins, use
keywords like vacation property, tahoe, cabin, etc. By owner is usually the
better deals.

Would you believe a bunch of "alternative" bands are releasing a cd of the
tunes from this cartoon/infotoon?  "I'm just a bill" and all your favorites!
Yay!

On a kinder note, those who saw Wicked at Burning Man will _definitely_
remember: "Parents...where's your child?  Haahaahahahaha!"  Pure evil...  :>

I worked late last night, and got some awesome views of this while
driving north on I-280, in between the heavy rain and hail storms. :-)
I described it to my SO, who happens to be an astrologer. She said that
it probably was Venus, given the time of day and proximity to the
Moon.

The government prevents a PUBLIC school official from leading voluntary
prayer, this is different.  My form of prayer requires 20,000 watts of
house music and a couple of bass bins :) but I think that would impinge
on the rights of others around me if I demanded to be able to do this 
in the public school system. Maybe a dramatic point but bear in mind that the
mention or acknowledgement of any "god" is offensive to some family who
wants to bring up their children as othadox atheists.
Now, if I form a private school, and the school buys a stack
of Communitys...

It's not exactly Rawhide, but there's already something sorta Western out 
there, complete with "haw, haw" and the sound of whips snapping. Either 
the track itself or the group that produced it has "Texas" in it -- Texas 
Twisters, maybe?  For those of you with Doran's "Innocence" tape, it's on

Ack!  Which also brings to mind the Grid's _other_ cheesy track, Swamp
Thing.  And that one makes me think of another that came out around the same
time, that Hedboys tune: "The boys and girls, are dancing on the floor..."
<evil grin>  I LIKE this game...

BY YOUR COMMAND;
        
        This a repost of an article I put together regarding several months
on Internet Freedom, and since the topics back up, I thought I'd post it
againFYE(For Your Enjoyment).

NOTE: Time magazine published a similar article about a month ago, & reading
it, I felt pretty good to beat them by over several months. Enjoy later.


Subject: Religion, Alien's & the Internet Re: Internet Bill of Rights 

Dear All;

	I feel somehow they will say that the Internet is excluded from
Freedom of Speech, reasons to follow. But I do feel that you are right
Neil, that if the Internet had existed back in the 18th Century they
would have included as part of Freedom of Speech, most definitely, & 
more on the positive Internet potential later.

	I feel they will attempt to exclude it from under constitutional
control because they need more ways to control us, and the Internet if it
falls into the hands of the government has the power & the future
potential to do that. 

	Old Religion is slowly fading away, the believe in Christ based
God in our society diminishes everyday. I personally feel man created this
entity for the purpose, initially of explaining things that couldn't be
explained, and also found that it was effective tool for controlling the 
masses and bringing about order from chaos.

	Please do not confuse spiritually with religion, they are two very
different things. For I like to think am a very spiritual person, or at
least to say I try an approach this state of being. But religion by
definition is a system of worship, devised by people. 

	The Bible & its similar counterparts, were documents that was
interpreted & passed down from person to person, generation to generation,
literally at times, by word of mouth. Due to this form of record keeping I
feel that the Bible & its counter parts have a very high probability, or at
least a lot of opportunity, of being altered or corrupted along the way.
Especially knowing and taking into account human nature, greed, lust
...etc. Also taking into account the levels of corruption in the various
houses of God though out history, war, fire ...etc. 

	So what would happen to the state of world stability if all of a
sudden, religion, or believe in a God, was found out to be incorrect or
void. That would mean, that you would spend your time on earth here, and
then die, and that would be it. I feel that some people would just rape,
pillage & kill, to serve their own needs, without any fear of repercussions
of an after life e.g. heaven & hell. This would be especially prevalent in
3rd world societies, where ignorance & fear already rule. I think most of 
us got the idea that hurting people wasn't OK, from some form of religion 
either in our lives or our parents lives.

	So what could prove that God doesn't exist, lets say that whole
Aliens think turned out to be true, that there were other life forms out
there. We were, as the Bible tells us, created in the image of
God(whatever that means). Christ, the Son of God, was a man, and was
created in our image according to the Bible. So then all of a sudden you
get these little dudes with antennae(just Kidding), and four arms, on world
wide TV. How will religion explain this, the Bible makes no reference to
other planets, or even other life forms other than human(I'm not a student
of the Bible, however). Religion will attempt to explain it with yet
another interpretation, vision(the Pope on Acid), dream, or say these
creatures/beings are the spawn of the Devil(nothing like a little
planetary racism). Which I feel will only serve to further the
non-existence of God, by weakening faith further(more spreading of hate). I
also feel that present day religion conflicts with itself a lot, but I
could go on forever with that one; and for example the Pope's recent 
racist comment about Buddhism.

	I feel we are not alone in our universe, and that our government 
as well as other governments know this, and see that the old systems of 
control are starting to weaken. Everyday we see more & more world chaos 
on our TV's. Nothing is, sacred or the same anymore, and everything is 
changing so fast. As they say, constant change is here to stay.

	Here comes the Internet, digital technology, total control of
potentially all digitized knowledge, history, & potentially even reality. 
This type of technology can easily & eventually be in every home, hut, &
cave in our world. Its just a matter of resources, meaning things that can
be created by society. In other words, no new technology has to be created
or devised, the systems need to be enlarged however to accommodate the
expanded user base. Most houses built in and after the 70's are already
wired for a telephone, video phone, & cable. The telephone company
installed the digital switching networks necessary to make the present and
not to distant future Internet function, 5 - 7 years a head of schedule. 
The telephone company, which is to a larger degree a major part of the
Internet, is always in a state of upgrading/retrofitting old equipment with
new equipment. Hard drive prices are at an all time low, something like
,39/MB, down from .90/MB, just last year. Memory chips still remain
rather high priced, but I image in time they will fall as well, as does the
price of most computer stuff. Look for memory to be traded on the
commodities market, within 10 years, that's my prediction. The average price
of a relatively powerful computer is affordable by most individuals and
families. 

NOTE: Hard drives are know at .20/MB another all time low, nd memory is
starting to fall.

	So why hasn't it already happened? There is a user education lag, with a
relativity cryptic interface to deal with, meaning ATT UNIX System
5 Version 4 & its clones. Although, more point & click net-browsers 
are making it easier for even the most novice of users to surf the 
net, e.g. Netscape, Mosaic. More of people-kind's written knowledge needs to
be digitized, and stored for available access on the net, this means that
everything from books to newspapers, need to be routinely digitized, along
with all the backlog/archives of the worlds knowledge. The commercial
people, people that provide services, and products on the Internet need to
start offering more for less money, and with more payment alternatives
than a credit card to purchase whatever, e.g. bank-card ...etc. The banks,
and other services need to, even though they are already on the Internet,
expand their systems & services to handle commercial traffic's size &
needs. But for the most part the systems of the net just need to be
enlarged to handle more users, providers, & vendors. In digital
technology, each time you upgrade or enlarge your system's capabilities, you
at least double your existing capacity, geometrically expanding each step up. 

	The Internet's sort of like an addictive drug that you give people,
you get them hooked in, two or three generations pass, and this is the way
people are used to doing things, like getting mail, paying bills, cashless
society & other basic life stuff. They forget how things were done before,
they become dependent on the this system, and way of doing things. For
example, being an engineer I have a lot of mathematical skill. Yet I
heavily rely on a calculator to do my routine calculations. I remember I
was out in the field one day and my batteries died. I had to do the
calculating things myself, and what was cake in grade school became a royal
pain in the butt for even the most basic of calculations. So what happens if
a system of checks & balances aren't in place on the Internet, and our
government or a corporation decides to pull the pug on whomever they don't
like or agree with. You are then locked out, your penniless(cashless
society), you can't get basic services, at the push of a button your an
exile in your own home & country. It sounds like something from Big Brother,
but in a digitized world, where information can be changed, all things are
possible, from a minor mistake, to history being changed.  There needs to be
strict data integrity monitors, either a committee of human beings, or
something hard-coded in the data to protect the information that is history.
Because as more & more of the world's knowledge is digitized, the less we
will be reliant on the written/printed word. 

	As much as our governments look to the Internet as a way to 
control societies & people, it looks on it with tremendous fear as well. The 
Internet has the potential of making societies where DIRECT democracy 
works. DIRECT democracy is were the people write, and vote on all 
legislation that has to due with that particular country. No more congress 
people or representatives, I would however image the need for some staff to 
take care of some of the lesser task's of government. You as a citizen 
would be responsible for taking part in our government, from your 
desktop, voting & introducing significant legislation. 

	It has the potential to end fear politics, by getting the peoples
of the world talking with each other. The Internet levels the power
playing field, it gives individuals the power to reach millions, meaning
everyone is the same. The more the whole of society embraces this
technology, the more power we will have as individuals, and the less BS our 
governments will be able feed us. With the Internet you have a common 
world language, a machine language, but its common. There is no doubt in my
mind that the Internet can play a significant role in helping bring about 
world peace. With the use of video phone, an electronic language 
translators, the leaders of our world can meet more often, and more 
informally.

	It has the potential to improve our environment, for example if
all regular mail went to E--mail. We would use so much less paper, have
to cut down fewer trees. With video phone links, the necessity to travel
would be reduced, reducing our overall usage & dependence on polluting
fossil & nuclear fission fuels, by several orders of magnitude. People
could stay home with their families and work over the phone lines,
improving the quality of the family unit in our country & the world ..etc. 

	As far as a knowledge base, and an education tool. The Internet
can bring the sum of the world's digitized knowledge to the remotest of
the world's corners, and with a video phone link, a teacher as well. Which
means it has the potential to end world ignorance and also education the
world. Also once digitized, the content & appearance of ancient reference
books, and manuscripts can be made available to anyone, not just
researchers, anytime their needed. Every book, in every library around the 
world at your finger tips.

	I personally will take any attempt by our government to limit, censor, or
control the Internet, as a direct attack on the Constitution of the U.S, by
our government. But I do feel more amendments are needed to the 
constitution to ensure our freedom & the freedom of the net, into & though
the 22nd century.

	The Constitution & the Declaration of Independence are beautiful
documents. I was born on the day they signed the Declaration of
Independence, only 186 years later. They called themselves an assembly of
demigods, the authors of those two documents. They are old documents, where
we are a modern society compared to 200 years ago. They must be carefully
brought into modern times, without any compromise to our personal freedom. I
feel the reason some of the other countries have been able to do so well, so
fast, is because they have a relativity new constitution & charter, take
Japan for example, their constitution has only been around since the end of
WW2. 

	Well, I take this stuff pretty seriously as you can tell, less the
Aliens & Religion stuff. The Aliens & Religion stuff is just a theory, 
its got a lot of holes, but no more than any of the modern religions do at 
present. I understand why, if these beings did exist why our 
government would want to keep the knowledge of their exist a very important
secret. On the positive side I feel such knowledge could destabilize our
world further. On the negative side, well lets not even thing about that.

                Jesus Christ Was An Alien

	Being born on a day where so much psychic energy was & is
happening, its hard to explain my relationship with it, and the way it
makes me feel. I believe in the self, I believe that's where our salvation
is, by acknowledging the self, and how truly wonderful & unique you are,
you can't help but see it in others, and know that all creatures big &
small, intelligent & dumb, have a right to be, and exist, in their
natural state, and on their path. So anything that assists us in developing
our uniqueness and individuality, gives us more headroom, gives us more
freedom, allows us to find & fulfill our individual destinies, transfers more
power from the governments & corporations to the individuals/self, I am of
course for. 

	The Internet as it grows and becomes more a part of our everyday lives,
means that we must elect computer literate politicians(Not Pete), who
believe in a free Internet, and understand the potential that the
Internet can bring to a free society, our world's environment, and our
world's stability & and also its pitfalls and traps that could potentially
enslave a free society. The way I look at it, the next 10 years is going
to be like 1776, only we won't be fighting the British for our freedom, we
will be fighting our government, corporations, and people who want to
limit our personal, and our children's freedom and Liberty on net. Now is
the time to make your voices, concerns, and idea's heard, not after the
legislation is written, by people like Exon, who are computer 
illiterate. Also, being the world's Internet leader, what we achieve or 
fail to accomplish with regard to the amount of personal freedom allowed 
on the net, will set the standard for the world. The world, with 
reference to the net will take our lead, so net awareness, participation 
in electronic protest against efforts to limit net freedom, and active 
participation in elections for candidates who are computer literate, 
and are for pro-Internet freedom, are necessary to ensure that the Internet 
remains as unrestricted as it is today.

	I remember the movie Sneakers, when Robert Redford was talking with his x
partner, and the x-partner said, that today's power is not
about who has the most bombs & missiles, it's who controls the information,
and I really believe that. I don't want to have to get a permit to send
someone a post just because it's out of the country. I don't want my
private messages read by a government censor, checking for content. I
personally want to be able to get access to & be in charge of all my
personal information, say what I feel & think, and go where ever I have
legal access to go to on the net; how bout you? The future is my
responsibility.

Does anyone know what cities, and/or states thes dj's are from? We are 
trying to create a database of all raves held in the US with such information 
as event name, production companies and phone numbers, dj's who spun at each 
event, where each event was located, e-mail addresses, prices of events, 
visual , lighting and sound companies. 
If anyone has any information regarding any of these dj's please let us 
know at "ravedata@partnercomm.com"
Thanks bunches!! =) =) =)

BY YOUR COMMAND;
        
        This a repost of an article I put together regarding several months
on Internet Freedom, and since the topics back up, I thought I'd post it
againFYE(For Your Enjoyment).

NOTE: Time magazine published a similar article about a month ago, & reading
it, I felt pretty good to beat them by over several months. Enjoy later.


Subject: Religion, Alien's & the Internet Re: Internet Bill of Rights 

Dear All;

	I feel somehow they will say that the Internet is excluded from
Freedom of Speech, reasons to follow. But I do feel that you are right
Neil, that if the Internet had existed back in the 18th Century they
would have included as part of Freedom of Speech, most definitely, & 
more on the positive Internet potential later.

	I feel they will attempt to exclude it from under constitutional
control because they need more ways to control us, and the Internet if it
falls into the hands of the government has the power & the future
potential to do that. 

	Old Religion is slowly fading away, the believe in Christ based
God in our society diminishes everyday. I personally feel man created this
entity for the purpose, initially of explaining things that couldn't be
explained, and also found that it was effective tool for controlling the 
masses and bringing about order from chaos.

	Please do not confuse spiritually with religion, they are two very
different things. For I like to think am a very spiritual person, or at
least to say I try an approach this state of being. But religion by
definition is a system of worship, devised by people. 

	The Bible & its similar counterparts, were documents that was
interpreted & passed down from person to person, generation to generation,
literally at times, by word of mouth. Due to this form of record keeping I
feel that the Bible & its counter parts have a very high probability, or at
least a lot of opportunity, of being altered or corrupted along the way.
Especially knowing and taking into account human nature, greed, lust
...etc. Also taking into account the levels of corruption in the various
houses of God though out history, war, fire ...etc. 

	So what would happen to the state of world stability if all of a
sudden, religion, or believe in a God, was found out to be incorrect or
void. That would mean, that you would spend your time on earth here, and
then die, and that would be it. I feel that some people would just rape,
pillage & kill, to serve their own needs, without any fear of repercussions
of an after life e.g. heaven & hell. This would be especially prevalent in
3rd world societies, where ignorance & fear already rule. I think most of 
us got the idea that hurting people wasn't OK, from some form of religion 
either in our lives or our parents lives.

	So what could prove that God doesn't exist, lets say that whole
Aliens think turned out to be true, that there were other life forms out
there. We were, as the Bible tells us, created in the image of
God(whatever that means). Christ, the Son of God, was a man, and was
created in our image according to the Bible. So then all of a sudden you
get these little dudes with antennae(just Kidding), and four arms, on world
wide TV. How will religion explain this, the Bible makes no reference to
other planets, or even other life forms other than human(I'm not a student
of the Bible, however). Religion will attempt to explain it with yet
another interpretation, vision(the Pope on Acid), dream, or say these
creatures/beings are the spawn of the Devil(nothing like a little
planetary racism). Which I feel will only serve to further the
non-existence of God, by weakening faith further(more spreading of hate). I
also feel that present day religion conflicts with itself a lot, but I
could go on forever with that one; and for example the Pope's recent 
racist comment about Buddhism.

	I feel we are not alone in our universe, and that our government 
as well as other governments know this, and see that the old systems of 
control are starting to weaken. Everyday we see more & more world chaos 
on our TV's. Nothing is, sacred or the same anymore, and everything is 
changing so fast. As they say, constant change is here to stay.

	Here comes the Internet, digital technology, total control of
potentially all digitized knowledge, history, & potentially even reality. 
This type of technology can easily & eventually be in every home, hut, &
cave in our world. Its just a matter of resources, meaning things that can
be created by society. In other words, no new technology has to be created
or devised, the systems need to be enlarged however to accommodate the
expanded user base. Most houses built in and after the 70's are already
wired for a telephone, video phone, & cable. The telephone company
installed the digital switching networks necessary to make the present and
not to distant future Internet function, 5 - 7 years a head of schedule. 
The telephone company, which is to a larger degree a major part of the
Internet, is always in a state of upgrading/retrofitting old equipment with
new equipment. Hard drive prices are at an all time low, something like
,39/MB, down from .90/MB, just last year. Memory chips still remain
rather high priced, but I image in time they will fall as well, as does the
price of most computer stuff. Look for memory to be traded on the
commodities market, within 10 years, that's my prediction. The average price
of a relatively powerful computer is affordable by most individuals and
families. 

NOTE: Hard drives are know at .20/MB another all time low, nd memory is
starting to fall.

	So why hasn't it already happened? There is a user education lag, with a
relativity cryptic interface to deal with, meaning ATT UNIX System
5 Version 4 & its clones. Although, more point & click net-browsers 
are making it easier for even the most novice of users to surf the 
net, e.g. Netscape, Mosaic. More of people-kind's written knowledge needs to
be digitized, and stored for available access on the net, this means that
everything from books to newspapers, need to be routinely digitized, along
with all the backlog/archives of the worlds knowledge. The commercial
people, people that provide services, and products on the Internet need to
start offering more for less money, and with more payment alternatives
than a credit card to purchase whatever, e.g. bank-card ...etc. The banks,
and other services need to, even though they are already on the Internet,
expand their systems & services to handle commercial traffic's size &
needs. But for the most part the systems of the net just need to be
enlarged to handle more users, providers, & vendors. In digital
technology, each time you upgrade or enlarge your system's capabilities, you
at least double your existing capacity, geometrically expanding each step up. 

	The Internet's sort of like an addictive drug that you give people,
you get them hooked in, two or three generations pass, and this is the way
people are used to doing things, like getting mail, paying bills, cashless
society & other basic life stuff. They forget how things were done before,
they become dependent on the this system, and way of doing things. For
example, being an engineer I have a lot of mathematical skill. Yet I
heavily rely on a calculator to do my routine calculations. I remember I
was out in the field one day and my batteries died. I had to do the
calculating things myself, and what was cake in grade school became a royal
pain in the butt for even the most basic of calculations. So what happens if
a system of checks & balances aren't in place on the Internet, and our
government or a corporation decides to pull the pug on whomever they don't
like or agree with. You are then locked out, your penniless(cashless
society), you can't get basic services, at the push of a button your an
exile in your own home & country. It sounds like something from Big Brother,
but in a digitized world, where information can be changed, all things are
possible, from a minor mistake, to history being changed.  There needs to be
strict data integrity monitors, either a committee of human beings, or
something hard-coded in the data to protect the information that is history.
Because as more & more of the world's knowledge is digitized, the less we
will be reliant on the written/printed word. 

	As much as our governments look to the Internet as a way to 
control societies & people, it looks on it with tremendous fear as well. The 
Internet has the potential of making societies where DIRECT democracy 
works. DIRECT democracy is were the people write, and vote on all 
legislation that has to due with that particular country. No more congress 
people or representatives, I would however image the need for some staff to 
take care of some of the lesser task's of government. You as a citizen 
would be responsible for taking part in our government, from your 
desktop, voting & introducing significant legislation. 

	It has the potential to end fear politics, by getting the peoples
of the world talking with each other. The Internet levels the power
playing field, it gives individuals the power to reach millions, meaning
everyone is the same. The more the whole of society embraces this
technology, the more power we will have as individuals, and the less BS our 
governments will be able feed us. With the Internet you have a common 
world language, a machine language, but its common. There is no doubt in my
mind that the Internet can play a significant role in helping bring about 
world peace. With the use of video phone, an electronic language 
translators, the leaders of our world can meet more often, and more 
informally.

	It has the potential to improve our environment, for example if
all regular mail went to E--mail. We would use so much less paper, have
to cut down fewer trees. With video phone links, the necessity to travel
would be reduced, reducing our overall usage & dependence on polluting
fossil & nuclear fission fuels, by several orders of magnitude. People
could stay home with their families and work over the phone lines,
improving the quality of the family unit in our country & the world ..etc. 

	As far as a knowledge base, and an education tool. The Internet
can bring the sum of the world's digitized knowledge to the remotest of
the world's corners, and with a video phone link, a teacher as well. Which
means it has the potential to end world ignorance and also education the
world. Also once digitized, the content & appearance of ancient reference
books, and manuscripts can be made available to anyone, not just
researchers, anytime their needed. Every book, in every library around the 
world at your finger tips.

	I personally will take any attempt by our government to limit, censor, or
control the Internet, as a direct attack on the Constitution of the U.S, by
our government. But I do feel more amendments are needed to the 
constitution to ensure our freedom & the freedom of the net, into & though
the 22nd century.

	The Constitution & the Declaration of Independence are beautiful
documents. I was born on the day they signed the Declaration of
Independence, only 186 years later. They called themselves an assembly of
demigods, the authors of those two documents. They are old documents, where
we are a modern society compared to 200 years ago. They must be carefully
brought into modern times, without any compromise to our personal freedom. I
feel the reason some of the other countries have been able to do so well, so
fast, is because they have a relativity new constitution & charter, take
Japan for example, their constitution has only been around since the end of
WW2. 

	Well, I take this stuff pretty seriously as you can tell, less the
Aliens & Religion stuff. The Aliens & Religion stuff is just a theory, 
its got a lot of holes, but no more than any of the modern religions do at 
present. I understand why, if these beings did exist why our 
government would want to keep the knowledge of their exist a very important
secret. On the positive side I feel such knowledge could destabilize our
world further. On the negative side, well lets not even thing about that.

                Jesus Christ Was An Alien

	Being born on a day where so much psychic energy was & is
happening, its hard to explain my relationship with it, and the way it
makes me feel. I believe in the self, I believe that's where our salvation
is, by acknowledging the self, and how truly wonderful & unique you are,
you can't help but see it in others, and know that all creatures big &
small, intelligent & dumb, have a right to be, and exist, in their
natural state, and on their path. So anything that assists us in developing
our uniqueness and individuality, gives us more headroom, gives us more
freedom, allows us to find & fulfill our individual destinies, transfers more
power from the governments & corporations to the individuals/self, I am of
course for. 

	The Internet as it grows and becomes more a part of our everyday lives,
means that we must elect computer literate politicians(Not Pete), who
believe in a free Internet, and understand the potential that the
Internet can bring to a free society, our world's environment, and our
world's stability & and also its pitfalls and traps that could potentially
enslave a free society. The way I look at it, the next 10 years is going
to be like 1776, only we won't be fighting the British for our freedom, we
will be fighting our government, corporations, and people who want to
limit our personal, and our children's freedom and Liberty on net. Now is
the time to make your voices, concerns, and idea's heard, not after the
legislation is written, by people like Exon, who are computer 
illiterate. Also, being the world's Internet leader, what we achieve or 
fail to accomplish with regard to the amount of personal freedom allowed 
on the net, will set the standard for the world. The world, with 
reference to the net will take our lead, so net awareness, participation 
in electronic protest against efforts to limit net freedom, and active 
participation in elections for candidates who are computer literate, 
and are for pro-Internet freedom, are necessary to ensure that the Internet 
remains as unrestricted as it is today.

	I remember the movie Sneakers, when Robert Redford was talking with his x
partner, and the x-partner said, that today's power is not
about who has the most bombs & missiles, it's who controls the information,
and I really believe that. I don't want to have to get a permit to send
someone a post just because it's out of the country. I don't want my
private messages read by a government censor, checking for content. I
personally want to be able to get access to & be in charge of all my
personal information, say what I feel & think, and go where ever I have
legal access to go to on the net; how bout you? The future is my
responsibility.

And if you can't get enough from the website, you can always pick up Grammar 
Rock and School House Rock videos from Toys 'R Us.  Plus they're showing it 
again on Saturday mornings on ABC.

Just a kid at heart,
Diane 

P.S.  I do know one dj that does play this on occassion.  I'll have to let him 
know what a memorabilia stir this is causing amongst us.

If the weather cooperates, the outdoor F&F will be the place to be on
Saturday.  The other parties for the weekend have pretty good lineups,
so go hear yer favorite DJ.

I think the new calendar generated on-the-fly is pretty solid now,
so the link off the SFR home page now uses it.  Update any links you
have to the old calendar page (sfrcal.html) to the new address (below)
because the old one may not be updated as frequently as the data file
for the new generated one.

The version of lynx I used to generate this message lists URL references,
which I'm not sure is useful.  Let me know if you like them.

Greetings,

Can anybody point me to a music distributor in the Bay Area?  
I'm looking for one that has a good selection of rave-style 
music.

Thanks in advance,

Greetings, everyone :) .  I'm having a job interview, and it looks like 
they require drug testing.  I just took a dose of MDMA about a week ago, 
and feel a little concerned, and I have a few questions I would like to post.

1) How long does it stay in the system?

2) Is it detectable by a urine test (which is what I am going to take) ?

3) Is MDMA commonly looked for in such a test, along with marijuana, 
cocaine, etc. ?

If you can answer any or all of these, it would be helpful. 

Thanks !! :)             James

MMDA is not often tested for, although it can be.
(Whups, MDMA above!  Silly unix editor. . .)
Standard tests include pot, coke, amphetamines, opiates, maybe a few
others like valium and barbituates thrown in for kicks.

MDMA can probably be detected for a week or so, max (not very fat-soluble
like THC).  Drinking lots of water the week before a test can help,
although I don't think it helps the day of the test b/c they standardize
their detection thresholds based on the amount of stuff in your urine.

So, don't worry!  99% chance they don't test for it, and even if they do
you're in the clear.

That's the Nightmare mix I mentioned. Dave Angel did it on cassette in his
bedroom. I'd say there's a strong likelihood I'll play it at Friends &
Family on Saturday if I end up playing.

Anyone interested seeing a British TV movie about ravers please reply.
I just received it, and would like to know if anyone would like to
come over and watch it.  It's called "Loved Up"-a pretty good
representation of the scene and its effects on people's lives.

Worth noting is that the soundtrack is available on CD. Includes songs
from Leftfield, Jaydee, Prodigy, and Sabres of Paradise to name but a
few. =)
It's released by BBC and Primavera as PRIMA CD2.

answer to #1 is approx. 6 weeks.  Try referring to The Psychedelics 
Encyclopedia by Richard Stafford, or Ecstacy, the MDMA story; these are 
two very helpful references.On Thu, 22 Feb 1996, James wrote:

	I picked up Mokum 49 this last weekend and one of the tracks is 
called ABBA-GABBA. It's that abba track at 200 bpm and somewhere between 
horrible and funny (depending I guess on how you feel about Abba).

	I haven't heard this new Eurythmics remix, but in general I do love 
tracks that cleverly sample old favorites in new and interesting ways.  A 
couple months ago, for example, I heard a groovy house remix of Marvin 
Gaye's "Sexual Healing" of all things, a song I never would have 
believed could sound good in such a context (even though I like the 
original) but did.
	One track I will always consider a classic of wonderful creative 
sampling is "Something Good" by the Utah Saints, which cranks up Kate 
Bush to 78 rpm or so with marvelous effect.

HEllo all,

I'm sure this idea has been thought before and may even exist in some 
form but so far I have not heard anything about it.

It seems that our list is much to broad in focus.  I believe for the 
information presented to become more efficient and effective it must be 
split into two groups.  1. SFRaves and 2. Rave culture.

1. List 1 would be a list dedicated to the discussion of the actual 
physical rave scene of San Francisco including how it interacts with 
the rave movement occuring all over the world.  This would include 
discussion on music, events, equipment, dj's, laws, and anything else 
that has to do with the actual act of raving.  Personal reviews of 
parties should go here because they help readers make future decisions 
about which parties to attend.

2. List 2 would be about rave culture.  Philosphy, spirituality, and 
opinons on Life in general and how it relates to raving.  The scope of 
this list would be much broader dealing with ideas that may not posses 
an apparent rave link.  

Since many of us feel that a rave list should be about Raves and others 
of us feel that a rave list should encompass spirituality as well, this 
split would be very helpful.  Those of us who want both can easily have 
that without much change in our mail.  Those of us who want one or the 
other will suddenly be allieviated (sp?) of excess mail.

The problem:  I have no idea what the costs, time constraints, 
equipment constraints, ect., it would entail to have two lists.  And I 
don't know how many SFRAVErs would even want this to happen.  I would 
be interested to hear from Brian on what it would take to do this.  
Honestly I don't even have a clue as to what it takes to set up and run 
SFRAVes.

Thanks in advance for any input.

love chris

I think this is a great idea given the tangents that we all go off on 
sometimes.

I have asked Brian for the same such thing on more than one occasion, and 
he has said no.

I listened to an interview on NPR with the guy who wrote the School House

writing more.  This time for the Nineties!!  He said one was going to be 
on budgeting your allowance and another on how Wall Street Works.

That's a nice idea, but I'd rather not see the list get split up that 
way.  I think posts on raves and the spirituality of raves very often 
overlap.  Should we then make another list that has posts that combine 
the two topics?  imho, I like it the way it is.
As for my $.02, I don't care much for that "sweet dreams" remix, but I love 
the remix of "I'll take you there."

Such a list was created a few months ago, called tribe.  You can join
it by sending mail to listproc@lists.Colorado.EDU and putting
subscribe TRIBE in the msg.

That list is rather dead now.  It seems that people get bored by
such discussions once they are removed from the context of a 
community like sfraves where the posters have many more reference
points in common.

And there's always the alt.rave newsgroup.  Philosophical threads
come up there every once in a while as well.

Dear Friends & Family,

	I understand and sympathize with the desire felt by Chris and 
others for two separate lists.  However I also feel that such a move would 
greatly detract from the depth and diversity of both lists without ever 
truly solving the "problem" of off-topic posts.  (I put "problem" in 
quotes because the range of feelings on whether this is a problem at 
all and if so how serious it is seems to be great).
	Please consider also what splitting the SFRAVES list in two would 
do to our evolving community - the symbolism would be that we are no 
longer one family, but two.  Certainly many of us, including myself would 
continue to subscribe to both lists, but the feeling of unity would decrease.
	Also, the total volume of mail would no doubt increase, because 
many messages deemed of importance to all of us would be posted to BOTH 
lists.  This would increase the pressure on people to subscribe to only one 
list or the other, or be inundated with duplicate mail.  As more people 
subscribed to only one list, more messages of a "general" nature would be 
sent to both lists, leading more people to drop one list or the other, 
and so on until we were two separate entities with few exceptions.
	Over time, I imagine that these two lists might further evolve in 
the following unproductive manner:
	The music/parties list might experience a "dumbing down" as 
reflected by a desire to talk of nothing more substantive than a review 
of the latest techno track or last night's party.
	The non-rave list might grow to be truly that -- a rambling 
discussion of nothing in particular, dominated by people who might 
occasionally or never actually attend parties, preferring to philosophize 
via computer.
	Please, let's not cause this to happen.  Let's stay as one, and 
moderate the tendencies on both sides towards a happy middle.

PLURally yours,
				<<< Starchild >>>

I was subbed to the UK Dance mailing list for a number of months and 
their posts were record, club and rave reviews ONLY.  I found it VERY 
boring and unenlightening.  I LOVE the topic diversity here on sfraves 
because I am always learning something and I am always challenged into 
thinking in a different perspective, therefore always growing. I still 
say that the easiest thing to do is that if you don't like a topic or 
thread, push the D button.  It is not that hard and I have done it MANY 
times.  My 2 cents today.

love,
Amy

I would have to say that it is the diversity of the topics covered that has
kept my interest and motivated me towards involvement in this community AND
culture.
Both are relevant aspects of what we all do and love.  Ultimately, both are
relevant and essential to each other.  IMHO, I think that splitting the
list up in such a manner would change the nature of the sense of unity and
cohesiveness we've all worked very hard to achieve.

You state that "...for the information presented to become more efficient
and effective it must be split into two groups..."  Could you please
elaborate?  Efficient to what purpose and effective to what end?  I only
ask so that I may be clearer as what your desires are and to put this into
a more proper perspective.  This not a flame but a simple query.  =)

I listened to an interview on NPR with the guy who wrote the School House 
Rock themes.  I can't remember his name, but he is in the process of 
writing more.  This time for the Nineties!!  He said one was going to be 
on budgeting your allowance and another on how Wall Street Works.  
AAAHHH, capitalism at its best!!!!

Such a list was created a few months ago, called tribe.  You can join
it by sending mail to listproc@lists.Colorado.EDU and putting
subscribe TRIBE in the msg.

That list is rather dead now.  It seems that people get bored by
such discussions once they are removed from the context of a 
community like sfraves where the posters have many more reference
points in common.

And there's always the alt.rave newsgroup.  Philosophical threads
come up there every once in a while as well.

That's a nice idea, but I'd rather not see the list get split up that 
way.  I think posts on raves and the spirituality of raves very often 
overlap.  Should we then make another list that has posts that combine 
the two topics?  imho, I like it the way it is.
As for my $.02, I don't care much for that "sweet dreams" remix, but I love 
the remix of "I'll take you there."

In a few days, the sfraves mailing list will be broken down
into a set of more focused, easy to manage ones.  These will
include, but not be limited to:

sfraves-party-reviews:
flame wars about whether a party sucked or not go here.

sfraves-geeks:
discussions about the internet, computers, sound equipment,
							      
sfraves-good_old_days:
Old skoolers get to tell you how much better things were back when.

sfraves-plur_exchange:
For when someone is have a bad days and needs a virtual hug, or
for when someone is having a good day and needs to give one.

sfraves-plur_wars:
flame wars about the meaning and hypocrisy of Peace, Love, Unity,
and Respect.

sfraves-brian-darkness:
Discussions on the life and thoughts of brian darkness, ad nauseum.

sfraves-anarchy:
Everything from all the other lists gets automatically crossposted
to this free-for-all forum.

sfraves-safety_and_comfort:
People get to whine about various dangers encountered at various
sites, i.e. "It was hot." "It was crowded." "I could of died."

sfraves-know-it-alls
This is where old skool experts get to tell everyone else where
to find some info i.e. "it's in the archives...".  Also used
to inform a newbie that their idea "has been done before."

sfraves-BSP:
Blatant Self Promotions: For DJs to announce the latest party 
you should see them at.  Also for promoters, and authors.

sfraves-taste:
for all taste war threads; trance vs. house, big parties vs
little ones... 

sfraves-drugs:
For the whos, whats, wheres, whys and why-nots about
drug use.  Encripted to implicate the innocent.

sfraves-appropriate_postings:
for all discusions revolving around which list a particular
post *really* belongs on.  Most sfraves traffic will probably end
up here.

Lee,

What a sensational idea. I love it!

While I'm here, who's going to the F&F party tomorrow? Mother nature looks 
like she could smile on us weather wise.

Cheers,

Okey doke, who's going to show at the big FnF daytime party tommorrow? I

Anyhow, I'll do my damndest to be there...

I look like this:
6'0", brown ear-length hair and I'll probably be wearing dark brown
airwalks, light brown corduroy pants and a long sleeved brown striped
shirt. And black socks. And generic Hanes boxer shorts. And "old spice"
deodorant. And contact lenses.

So if yer there, come up and say hi because I don't many of y'all yet.
Those of you who I do know (you know who you are :) make yerselves known.

later,
-mike.

I hope so, but I keep hearing that it is supposed to rain.  I'm keeping 
my fingers crossed.  Some one had asked when we would officially know if 
the party is on or now.  Ethan, do you know about what time you are going 
to post on the voice mail or here on the mailing list whether 
it will be on or not?  I'm going to be driving from Sac and would like to 
know at least before 1:30 tomarrow whether it is a yes or a no.   
Thanks!

love,
Amy S.

thank you thank you thank you and bless you because THIS FRIDAY HAS SUCKED SO
FAR and now I FEEL SO MUCH LIGHTER!!  hoooooooeeeeey!

hope to see everyone out and feeling fine this weekend!  PLEASE come introduce
yourselves to me at Satori -- I'll be the voluptuous woman with some freaky
crazy hat (fur, feathers, weird fuzzy straw, haven't decided yet) -- and tattoos
on my shoulders, lots of silver bracelets --  

I'm bringing special treats for every SFRaver who comes up and says HI to me --

Hey you forgot SFRAVES-pretentious arguments about the world from
                       university students, where students such as 
                       myself show off all the cool stuff we learned in 
                       our econ/political science/anthropology/etc. classes!

i have a suggestion, based on what i've seen on other lists...
it seems to work there, but it's a lot more uh..orderly list.

the idea is to have standard prefixes used in the subject line of each post,
for instance if someone were writing a review, the subject line would be:
Subject: REVIEW: crysalis     or 
Subject: RANT: why pat buchannan is cool  or 
Subject: GEEK: what is a hyperreal?

you get the idea i'm sure... if there were a few "standard" categories 
people could agree on, they could be mentioned in the faq.


just a thought,
justin

As with most events that require pro-climate weather, it's impossible to
say exactly when the decision will be made, but most likely around noonish.
The louder the weather speaks, the soon the decision will be made.

Definitely by 1:30 PM, Sacramento time.  Now Amy if you only lived in San
Francisco this problem wouldn't come up...

And a HUGE ;^) to that!

Love ya!

I figure if a man (or woman) was flexible enough to get his face
between his legs, they'd have better things to do than type or smile.

Efficient in the sense that an individual could get the mail that he 
would want to recieve.  I personaly would subscribe to both because I'm 
interested in everything the list/lists have to offer.  But over a 
period of almost a year I have gotten the feeling that many people on 
the list are not interested in the spirituality side of the scene.  Not 
everyone gets that from raving. 

The spirtiual/philisophical side of raving is very broad indeed.  
Honestly I would love to see more posts on things such as shamanism, 
magic, ufo's, philosophy, the goverenment, history, science, the 
universe, and anything else that might have a connection to raving 
(even if remotely).  It's hard to really define what is rave related.  
To me if it has to do with the universe than its probably rave related 
because raving has a very profound and direct inpact on how I look at 
the universe.  Many may see some discussions as going way off on a 
tangent.  

Judging from the responses two lists is a bad idea.  I got excited when 
I heard the mention of the list Tribe but was quickly dissapointed to 
hear that it failed.  Mabey in the future a list can be started that is 
directly related to rave culture.  Or better yet just modern 
spirtiuality from Dead heads to ravers.  

Thanks everyone for the input!  I don't mind at all if we have just 1 
list.  I think the diversity is great and love to hear about parties, 
music, spirtitality, philosophy, ect.  Hopefully the D-button is good 
enough for anyone who only wants 1 aspect of the rave thing.

Hello all,

Lately I have been longing for booney doon (sp?).  It's been 1 year and 
11 months since I last danced my ass off at that sacraed place.  And 
it's been exactly 2 years since I was full enlightened on that very 
same beach.  Feburary full moon 1994.  Wow!

What I would do to be on that beach again!  But from what I've heard 
the ticket for parking there at night is so outrageously high that 
having parties there is a bad idea.  I also heard that at the March 
1994 full moon some drunk shumcks tore down some fences for fire wood.  
I can't be too mad at them since I know I warmed myself by at least one 
bonfire.  But that apparently gave the authorties reason to be upset.

But Could anyone tell me exactly what all the problems are that prevent 
a good all night massive from occuring there.  And for that matter have 
there been any secret parties going on at booney doon?  I live in Sac 
town so dont get to Santa Cruz much.

Honestly, I have a feeling what this place needs is on huge 3-4000 
people shing-=ding right on that beach.  Mabey even a 3 day event where 
all the major sound systems of the bay area get together on common 
ground and ROCK our asses off!!!  Mabey right at the begining of summer 
a huge festival to start off what will surely be another amazing 
streach of great outdoor parties.  

What do you think?

love chris

Yes, parties on that beach have been a trigger-point for many of us.

Last I checked the ticket price is $35, not too much to share if you
car-pool (considering that the $25 parties are in fashion once again),
yes and indeed during the march full moon someone tore down a fence and
the authorities sent a message to the community that "this must stop".

Well I think a 4000 person massive is definitely NOT what that beach needs.
Times have changed, during the early bonnie doon FMRs people would leave the
beach cleaner than they found it.  The later parties left the beach full of
trash, millions of cigarette butt and hundreds of bottles, people shifted from
picking up a little more then the trash that they created, (which always
resulted in a spotless beach in no time) to leaving their trash behind for
others.  That and the facts that most people come now to be spectators and
to be entertained as opposed to being co-conspiritors makes it even hard for
people who did it as a labor of love. Fat-ass sound systems are heavy and
very hard to get up the long sandy hill.

There have been FMRs and smaller parties there since then, most in the 300
person size which seems to be about right for the area and authorities.

There have also been FMRs and other parties at another beach close by Bonnie
Doon.

Subject: how I got my name !!!
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

You know many people over the years have asked how I got my name, well I
thought this would be a good time to share the story........... 
 
When I lived in L.a. (yuk!) and much much younger, I thought it was funny
to moon people, and I was always mooning people given every excuse too!!! 
 
now one night I was bartending and an old really really good friend showed
up unexpectidly, now generally we wern't allowed to party at work, but my
boss said it was o.k, because my friend was there etc.... 
 
so I get off at about midnite and start to party, now I havn't eaten all
day, and I drink 4 long island ice tea's before we leave at 1:30am.......by
this time I was already mooning people insidethe bar. We decide that the
next day were going to go skiing so we have to drive to her house in
seperate cars so we can leave early in the morning together. 
 
As we are driving through Marina Del Rey I think wouldn't it be funny if I
mooned her, so I try to manuever ahead of her so I can moon her at an
intersection. So I take off my work shorts and continue driving to get
ahead of her. but she goes the alternate route, so I have to do an illeagal
u turn, as I enter the intersection she realized she messed up so she does
a u turn and now we are driving different directions, so I do another
illeagal u turn and try to catch up again.  
 
Now I have to run a red lite to keep her in my sights, she turns left and I
see an oppertunity to reach an inter section before her by driving down 2
blocks and turning left, I will moon her as she comes through the
intersection, accept that she barrols through and I miss the opportunity,
so I do a california right turn, (run a red lite without stopping......) 
 
now I'm chasing her again......and next thing I know I'm seeing the red and
blue cop lites, as I'm being pulled over, shit I think I'd better out on
some shorts before they come to my car, and realize I'm half
naked.........well in my hurried motions to slip on my shorts, I freak out
the cops and they pull their guns on me and tell me to exit the
car.........well I was so drunk, I got both legs stuck in one leg of the
shorts and I had to exit the car in an extrememly embarresing situation,
the cops ask me if I know why i'm was stopped, and naturally I'm not going
to say I just pulled about 5 illeagal manuevers, so I say innocently enuff
NO. well they said I ran a red lite (thank god thats all they saw!!), they
suggested I put my pants on straight and take a drunk driver test.......I
concured and explained that I was trying to follow a friend home but that
she had taken a wrong turn and I was trying to catch up with her, thus the
running of the red lite. 
 
They wanted to know why I had no pants on and I told them that I just got
off work, and that I was sweating in my polyester work shorts, amd I was
attempting to change into my beach shorts (I had been to the beach before
work), and then unexpectidely my friend took a wrong turn and I was just
trying to catch up with her........etc... 
 
I then told them that I then was pulled over by you guys (the cops) and you
can see how embarasing this all is etc......well they went back to discuss
what to do with me, and probably thought it was all very funny, because
they returned and said that I was borderline drunk and since I only lived a
few blocks away, that I should drive home and sleep it off, and they
added," Just keep your pants on son" and to my amazement, they let me go,
no ticket, no bust, no nothing.......PHEW !!!! what a relief. 
 
well I worked at a radio station in malibu at the time and I was refered to
as the MOON DOG, except because I was new to the buisiness, and there was
already a moon dog in malibu (gidget films), I decided to be a pup
instead........ 
 
.........so there you have it, I became the MOONPUP.....needless to say I
rarely moon anymore.......... 
 
If I'd known that the name MOONPUP would stick with me for the rest of
time, I would have thought up a different name.......You all might have
known me as Phil DeVoid................

Sat photos of the west coast
(http://www.atmos.uiuc.edu/wxworld/images/IMAGEg9pvis/96022323.GIF)

show major winter storm activity 3000 km off the coast, it won't be here
today BUT there is squal activity all along the california coast, I think
we should expect intermittant showers during the day.  If I were ethan
I would probably go for it but bring rain gear and expect to get wet.

It's the kind of day that with the right amount of positive energy
(and a good weather witch :) we could buffet the rain clouds around the
site.

Hey Starchild,
        How are you? Did you ever hear the rumor that Mr. Rogers did
cocaine? Was watching the show a couple years ago ( in preparation for
college ;-) and noticed him say " Toot Toot Lady O'Lane". Do you think
there can be any truth to this rumor.
        It wouldn't surprise met to think Jim Henson smoked something from
time to time either. Cookie Monster = Stoner with the munchies. :-?

	Needless to say, Shaggy and Scooby Doo are *the* 
archetypal animated reefer freaks... snarfing scooby snacks, 
forgetting where they were headed and ending up in the kitchen of 
some haunted mansion, etc...
	And, best of all, "Scooby DOOBIE Doo!"

Satori is being held by the Raindance people, known for good parties. 
About six of us are going, hope to see you all there...

BTW, does anyone know where this is being held?

I don't kow about Web sites, but there are several books that list all
broadcasters in the US.  Some are trade pubications and cost thousands
of bucks, but a less elaoborate one I know about is called White's Radio
Log.  You could also check at any decent sized library . .

THE BOMB! I was completely sober and i danced like a nut! I ussually get hell
of tired, but I stayed till the music went off! It was so hot! There were a
ton of smiles and lots of love.... The records were skipping to much though
and that really sucked. I liked the visuals....That place is just as bad as
acme as far as if there  was a  fire.....It would have been chaos! It rocked!
See you all at basics!
BTW how was the FNF party. I went to help with the setup of techno temple.

 SFRaves list]

 A grim weather report was dampening the chances for yesterday's 
Friends and Family daytime event at Point Molate :

SAN FRANCISCO BAY REGION

.TODAY...SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS...POSSIBLY WITH SMALL
HAIL.  HIGHS UPPER 40S TO MID 50S. WEST WIND 10 TO 25 MPH.
.TONIGHT...NUMEROUS SHOWERS WITH ISOLATED EVENING THUNDERSTORMS. 
 LOWS 30S AND LOWER 40S. WESTERLY EVENING WIND 10 TO 25 MPH.

 Despite the predictions of the weathermen , the sun was (mostly)
shining above us , so Ethan said "GO!".

 The sound system was already unloaded by the time I got there at 
12:45PM . After a few drops fell from the sky, we decided to put
up my collapsible awning. ( After yesterday , I think I may buy 
another one that handles easier and is waterproof !)

 Music started on-time ! ( Someone please post the DJ sequence ).
Folks gradually arrived , despite the predictions of thunderstorms. 
We were making our own sweet techno thunder on the ground! 

 And the weather gods gave us a break, for a few hours . Looking 
across San Pablo Bay, it seemed that Mt. Tamalpias was sending an 
invisible cleaving ray up to the sky , parting the clouds so that 
they sailed to the north and south of us. Not another drop , even 
some sunshine slanting in through breaks in the clouds.

 At the other end of the park was the ambient music setup. Given 
the location and the difference in volume, it was overlooked by 
most folks , unless they were walking to the porta potty. Despite 
the worsening weather and a lack of a steady audience , DJs Andrew , 
Phred , Claire , et al persevered ! 

 The weather did worsen - at about 3:30 , rain drops started falling.
Then , the wind from the west increased dramatically - wind chill!
But we kept on dancing! Some folks discovered the intense sensual 
experience of dancing at the bayside edge of the park , leaning
into the frigid wind . It felt like flying! Just at that time, a 
flock of seagulls flew close to us over the beach as we danced at
the edge , enhancing the fantasy of being airborne 

 From somewhere ( Derek Capito? ) , two more canopies showed up to
protect the sound equipment and the ravers who were close enough to 
get under the canopies.

 I dug out my yellow rain jacket and put it on .What was happening 
with the ambient setup? I walked along the beach to their site on 
a childrens' play structure. They had already put up more blue tarps 
on the seaside of the structure , and the speakers were moved under 
the roof. It did seem like a jetty or some similar blockish seacraft, 
floating along on ambient/jungle seas , with strong westerly winds 
blowing in the sea spray. 

 I split my time between the dance site and the ambient site. Near
the end , despite the great view of the bay and the Marin County
highlands, I was seriously considering curling up in the cab of my
truck and waiting for the music to stop so I could help with
break down. The worst of the weather had departed by 7:00PM , but
it was getting colder. 

 I ended up in the top of the ambient "boat" , under the tarp -
someplace dry and wind free! But warm, but the wind chill was
reduced enough to let me recover. Claire's ambient music was 
entrancing - I got into some strange meditative mindset then. Maybe
pre-hypothermia ? It was a small special moment.

 I spent a short time after that hanging out on the "deck" near some
candles. Then , back to the dance area for a final warm up! About
30 people were still left of the maximum crowd of about 150 folks.
A haloed sliver of moon and the stars were above us - lights of
humanity along the bridge and across the bay. I danced and chatted
and danced. 

 The music faded out at about 8:20 PM. Break down went without
incident , and we left the park ( with a bit of nudging from a
patrolman ) at about 9:17 PM.

In closing:
 Despite moments of physical misery , I had a great time! It was
so good to see so many happy faces again. We were joined together
by the music and friendship and our defiance of and merging with 
the wind and the rain. Many thanks to Ethan Miller and John Carel
for exposing their speakers and electrical equipment to the hostile
elements. I'm assuming Joe Rice provided the ambient site sound
equipment - thank you Joe! Hello again and au revoir to everyone
who I met ( I was the guy with a gray turtleneck shirt and black and
yellow checked "Goofy" (tm) shirt and clunky red "SFR" cap . Next
time - better outdoor clothes!). God bless everybody who was there.

Hi everyone!

well, I made it to Friends and Family yesterday, and IMHNERO it was
incredible! despite the weather (which was kind to us considering the dire
predictions) I had a fun time. That small patch of sunshine betwixt 3 and 4
was really nice.

Alex-- thanks for the ride and the conversation, I really appreciated it
and I'll see you at MAD monday.

Brian D.-- It was great *finally* meeting you even though I did lose track
of you... did you leave?

Ethan-- good party! I'm looking forward to getting that tape you mentioned
of your Feb. 12th MAD set... how much will it cost?

Shawna-- good seeing you again, hope to go to F-8.

Tom L.-- you've changed a lot since Bell :)

Eric P., Knucklehead etc, nice meeting you all!

-mike.

While Dancing in the Moonlight Bright 
A Sense of Freedom our only Sight 
 
The Musical Journey a Beautiful Trip 
Creatively Wound Sounds Totally Hip 
 
Inside the Soul we Feel the Beat 
As Groovy Tunes will Move our Feet 
 
Staying on Past the Early Dawn 
As Peaceful Thoughts Begin to Spawn 
 
The Feeling of Freedom Takes over Thee 
Free Dancing People a Sight to See 
 
Dancing can Reach such a Peaceful Height 
Thats why we Dance under Moonlight Night 
 
 
 
this poem is dedicated to the concept of dancing all night long, to seek
freedom in the ultimate and ancient human way, tribal ritual Dance

I showed up at FnF about 3pm or so, it was a cool set up.  It 
was in this outdoors area at Pt. Richmond, I've never been there 
before.  When I first got there, there weren't that many people there, 
and I was kinda lacking in energy.  Then I remembered that I forgot to 
have my coffee that day, so after hanging out for a while by myself 
staring out to sea (it was right on the beach), I hopped back into my 
car & went out in search of a big ol' cup of coffee.  After attaining 
said coffee, I later returned back to FnF, and there were suddenly a 
huge bunch of people there!  The music rocked, lotsa people were 
dancing, & it was a lot of fun.  At that point the weather was pretty 
nice, and it was one of those days where, even tho it was daylight, the 
moon was still riding high in the sky!  Later in the day, the clouds 
came back and it began raining some.  It wasn't that bad, no enormous 
downpours or anything, but it was enough to drive off some of the 
people that were there before, which left just us dancers dancing 
around in the rain & mud.  It's cool to dance in the rain!  And later 
on, as sunset began, miraculously the clouds began to disperse and the 
rain stopped, and there again was the moon shining brightly in the dark 
blue sky with venus blazing away near it.  Right across the water was 
the Richmond bridge (our park was right near the entrance to that 
bridge), and at dusk they turned the lights on.  So we now have the 
crescent moon, Venus, the sunset, the bridge all lit up, the ocean, and 
the whole group of friends & family madly dancing the dusk away!  You 
couldn't get the smile off my face!  A lot of us stayed till the bitter 
end, when it was completely dark and we were freezing our asses off, & 
we danced just as much to stay warm as for the sake of dancing.  Then 
they broke down all the equipment, & several of us lounged around 
talking with friends.  All in all, it was a blast!

Love,
Shawna

WE'RE CHANGING PLATFORMS! cindy got a stellar deal on a mac, which means
the ol' PC is off to the sister's house to get her through high school. 
 
would any mac users please share anything that got them
going...shareware,internet,graphics,etc. all interest me. i could use a

F&F was a blast.  It was a too cold by the chill out area so I ended
up spending the entire time dancing on the dirt/mud by the main system.
Good decision not to have this party at the Berkely Marina where we 
would have killed a lot of grass.

Scott (Cloud Factory) started things of with a great variety ofi upbeat
tunes that quickly warmed things up.  His set seemd to coax the sun
into thinking "hey, I want in on this!" and out it came to join us for a
bit.  Tim (I think) followed and soon started playing some really fresh-
sounding stuff.  I'm not totally up on the latest categorizations; 
Electro?  IDM?  Lot's of cool backward sound effects and the most 
inventive non-jungle rhythm programming i've heard in ages - complex,
weird, but always maintaining the groove.  I went nuts.  I remember
thinking once "Hey tim, can you please play something boring so I can
go take a leak?"  

Besides the exciting music and (to my ears) flawless mixing, the sound
quality was superb.  Special thanks to Ethan, John Carel, Joe Rice and
everyone else who contributed equipment and helped haul it out.  You
guys really care and a lot of us really appreciate it.  This isn't guitar 
noise we're listening to;  The music we love covers the entire sound 
spectrum and so much of it gets lost when a system can't deliver. 

Next up was, uh, "Wild Jeff" (?).  Who is this kid?  He seemed to have 
a little bit of that "I'm a superstar" attitude (perhaps just my
imagination) but his set was incredible.  A mix of acid, progressive
house, techno, trance; it all sounded new, positive, and flowed
together.  I can sum it up in one word: Wow.  

I became a wimp at around 6:30, after 4 hours of nonstop bliss.
It was nice seeing all the familiar faces (Hey Geoff, we missed you).
With all that great music, outdoors with nature, I couldn't have 
asked for anything more.  Thanks again! 

Lee

For those that decided not to come because of the inevitable rain, I'm
sorry.  I can understand, I too was hesitant and waited through my coffe to
hear the rush of a full-on down pour, but it never came.  I called the
voice mail and Ethan sounded so enthusiastic, what could one do but check
it out.

Friends and Family, February 24, 1996 -- Pt. Molate Park, California

I swear to you, the clouds parted before us.  It was as if the shield of
faith that the rain wouldn't come held tight and kept the rain off for at
least four hours.  Imagine a line of freaks along the ocean-side edge of
the park dancing the clouds away.  It did rain at around five or so, but
not too hard.  In fact it was rather nice to see Dave "Man of 1,000 lights"
erect a rain shelter faster than I could open a beer.  And then another
(shelter...:^).

"Yeah, but *those* clouds aren't going to seperate for us" I said pointing
to a black, ominous wall of thunderstaorms.  "Aw, man, those are blowing
the other way!" Replied Ethan with faith.  And they did.  I had to smile.

At it's peak, about 300 or so people came out to Pt. Molate to dance and
smile and hug.  It was a wonderful day.

Kudos to those crazy FnF kids!

Tone

P.S.  I have to say, I worte this at 2am Saturday night completely freaking
my friends out when I said, "I'm going to work to write email!"  They
thought I was nuts.  At least I was wise enough to reread it this morning.

        Kilgak Granitehand finally learned that Elembeth is a Spellfire
wielder, and...oh, wait!  Wrong update :)
        This was one of the most enjoyable parties I've been to yet!  I got
there a little after 4pm, and there was already a friendly vibe, and people
having fun.  I saw some familiar friends (hi Shawna, Jonathan, Rachel,
Nikki (sp?), Crunchman, et al) and that made me feel welcome, especially
since no one from "The Crew" was there.  They don't know what they missed!
I met some wonderful new friends, too (hi Sun, Starchild, Purple Tiger,
Phoenix, and the tall English fellow!).  Yes, there was a guy named Sun
there, so we had a brightly-shining sun with us the entire time!  It was
easy to get into the spirit of dancing, and being outdoors gave the scene a
tribal feel the likes of which I've found only at Grateful Dead shows, if
you can believe that!
        The rains came to cool us off and clense us, and most of us didn't
mind too much that it was so chilly.  Dancing and staying close together
helped, and enough of us projected our desire for a clear spot in the sky
to drive the rain past us that it came to pass!  I missed the tea, but the
hot chocolate was an excellent call.  This was the first outdoor party I
enjoyed, mostly because it was such a new experience being at the water's
edge, dancing in the rain, meeting more new friends than usual, as I was in
a good talking mode.  For the first time, I danced for nearly the entire
time, pausing only to chat with the legendary John the Raver Draper before
hitting the dance crowd again when it was dark.
        The last DJ (Minor Minor?) impressed me, and Rachel directed my
attention to him, and also helped me to sort out my head at the end so I
could remember that there were domestic issues awaiting my attention at
home, so I'm glad I didn't blow it by following the party crowd to the
other side of the bay, as I otherwise would have.  The party ended in good
time for me to get home, take care of things, and hit the sack, all the
while still carrying all the joy inside me that I both brought to and found
among you all.
        Super big hugs, smiles, and lots of love and THANKS to everyone who
was there, especially to those whose names I don't yet have down but with
whom I got to chat and dance.  I was glad that I didn't overdo anything,
had enough of my own water to drink and still offer to many people.

Love y'all!

His name is BIOJeff (actually, his name is Jeff McGann, and he's from
Sacramento).  He's been spinning for a while now (3-4 years), and is just
now becoming appreciated in The City.  But it's a long process, that jump
from spinning for your pets to spinning for 300 and more, right?

I can tell you Lee, and anyone else interested, he does not have a
"superstar" attitude.  I know him well, and I say this even if my judge of
character doesn't mean shit to you.  He's a GREAT guy.  In speaking with
him after the party, he not only appreciated the opportunity to spin for
Friends and Family, he was excited about the set and said it was amazing to
see the reaction the crowd gave him.  We talked about the magical loop that
flows from DJ to dancers to DJ.

He'll be happy to hear your thoughts...

:^)
Tony

P.S.  Now all he needs is email!

Glad to hear it, my mistake.  Your word is good enough for me.  Let
him know that at least one old skooler though he was the shit.  Best

>Lee Fogel and Tony both wrote about Jeff/BIOJeff --

I gotta say this guy was SO RIGHT ON I couldn't believe it, we had just gotten
there, it was raining, and the music was SO PERFECT with that amazing happy
vibing crowd, I kept asking people who he was until I found out -- the rain, the
music, the people, the dancing, I was totally high on it ...

I'll definitely keep an eye out to hear him spin again, he was so in tune with
us, and his stuff just kept rolling into different happy can't resist music..

this was my first F&F event, and I can't wait 'til the next...

hello all!

  My name is Clinton. I live in St. Paul, MN, and I have been 
monitoring your seemingly harmless transmissions for some time now....

ok, this is hokey. sorry.

HI, I'm visiting SF for my Spring Break this year which is March 16-23.
I choose this beautiful venue in place of the Cancun/Mazatlan-Mexico-
raped-by-American-tourism-shite.
At any rate, I just wanted to extend a pre-hello to anyone I might
luckily meet from the sfraves list (hoping it will be many).
I am really excited to attend something like F&F, FMR, or a ravenic.
Believe it or not, we gotz nothin' like this in the midwest so far as
I have seen! and you all seem like the most wonderful people to be able
to talk to! 
   
     ok, now for the personals. I'm 18 yrs old. um, what else do you
want to know? Extremely amiable. and i'm a DJ!
which brings up another question!  if anyone is having a party they
would like to hear the midwest sound at, I would be willing to bring down
a small selection of my rekkids. I spin gabber/happy gabber/some happy 
hardcore. guess what? I'll even do it for FREE! 

oh yeah, i'm staying with friends in Pleasanton. anyone live near there?
and do any of you have a cafe or coffee shop you regularly hang out at?


love you all, hope to get some replies,
clinton

Here is some interesting insights from Moscow and the Rave scene there.
I ran across this dude who posted in UKDance mailing list.   I've since
been in Email contact with this dude,  who is providing me with some
pretty good stuff,  and I want to share it with you.

>Re. underground raves... Hmmm, no, not so many. There're some, but
>(1) irregular, (2) in different places, (3) mostly organized for
>"tusovka" /friends/ - about < 200 people. Also Ptyuch is the only
>underground club in Moscow.

>Re. authorities. Sometimes... they always want to you to pay. If
>you pay 'em good money don't worry... use drugs, fuck on the
>street, burn the national flag, etc. Money!!!

>Re. America ("Sweet land of liberty"). I know... OK, "Sweet land
>of liberty..." is from America (My Country 'Tis of Thee) - 1831.
>"Thy liberty in LAW..." (?!) is from America, the Beautiful -
>1893(?). 1996 -??? What the HELL is LIBERTY in LAW?

>Radio... Yes, we have lots of various radio stations in Moscow.
>But the most interesting is Radio "Station" (106.8 FM), formed in
>Oct. 1995. "Station" is the first 24 hr. rave radio station in

hello all, and thanks for all the responses to my desperate plea.  i seem
to be able to post, but i can't get any of your posts.  hopefully, brian
and/or derek can fix it, for i feel like i can speak but not hear, see,
touch, taste, or smell.  kinda sucks.  but, hopefully it'll be fixed
immediately.

peace, love, and lent-

I've gotta say, Jeff is one of the first people I ever met when i started
going to raves, and he's got to be one of the cooooolest cats on this
planet.  He's extremely approachable, and strikes me as being a very real
person.  He always comes up and says hi when we end up at a party together.
Unfortunately, though, I've still never gotten the chance to hear him spin
:( One of these days, though...

hello all-

i hope that the idea to split the list into separate lists was a joke.  if it
wasn't, here's my $.02

if that idea was a joke and i haven't figured it out yet, read no further,
for it shall embarass me.  but if it is a real idea, that my opinions follow.

NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  

i got drawn into this list because it was a community.  it dealt with
partys, spirituality, music, drugs, helping each other, meeting
cool people, and many other things.  i lumped them all into the word "raving",
and i think that many others have, also.  once these things are separated, we
are no longer a community.  at that point, we're just a bunch of
single issue listserves like brewing beer, programming perl, etc. 
we are much more than that, and i would be very dissapointed to see
that go away.  in fact, i would possibly be a little angry. possibly i value
this community more than others, but it makes my life just a little bit
fuller and more fun.  the uniqueness of sfraves is that we deal with so
many things and, in fact, function like a community.  we deal with the
shit that communities deal with, like flame wars.  we deal with the great
stuff that communities deal with, like making friends and dancing
together.  what other listserv would invite its members to the owner's
wedding party?

i think i have spoken.  i hope that was a joke.  call me ultra-sensitive
and touchy, but the thought of it splitting almost made me sick.

peace, love, and sfraves-

matt l.

p.s. any responses to this, please respond to me personally because i'm
not getting my posts for some reason.

	Greetings everyone!
I've just moved to SF from middle'o nowhere Indiana (Purdue)

Anyone going to any of the weekly functions tonight, or can
recommend one?  Thanks for any info!  And hope to meet some

Hey everyone,

I've been searching everywhere for a track by "La Funk Mob" called "Trip 
La Funk."  I was told it was on the Mo' Waxx label, but that La Funk Mob 
doesn't do anything anymore, so I'd have to look on compilations.  I 
think it's a bit old (maybe 4-5 yrs old), but I'd love to get my hands on 
it.  Actually I'd love to get anything by La Funk Mob because the stuff 
I've heard was sooo funky.  I guess you'd classify the music as Trip 
Hop/Acid Jazz, but correct me if I'm wrong.

Thanks a million,
kc

How funny, I used something like that a looooong time ago, although I also
mixed in other bits, like the  and the "yeehaw!"

The song is "Gotta Be Starting Something" or something like that.

"too high to get over, to low to get under, you're stuck in the middle, and 
it hurts like thunder..."   oooowwww....

Although not a sfraves hang out, you should check out Yo' Mama's Cafe on 
College Ave.  On Saturday from 5-9 there are two cool Jungle DJ's who spin: 
Stareyes and Thad.  On other nights various dj's spin anything from 
hip-hop to techno and house.  Check it out.  There is a good vibe, 
although it is poorly known and doesn't have a strong local following.  
But, it SHOULD, 'cuz it's a nice place to hang out.  (I don't know the 
address.  YOu can get it from the calendar.  It's at the end of College 
Ave, where it intersects Broadway---in Oakland).

Well this was one mental weekend!!! I went to FnF from about 5 til it 
finished, met Eric Pedersen, and generally had a wild time. The sprinkles 
didnt bother me at all, I really enjoyed Minor Minor's set at the end. 
After the music stopped we went back to Crunchman's house, ate, then 
headed for Techno Temple. We got there a little after 11 and even though 
the $20 seemed high we headed in. Met Jondabomb outside  Hi He is totally 
right. It was the complete BOMB. I spent the whole night in the trance 
room. I don't know the order of the dj's except that Sausee ended with a 
set that was SICK SICK SICK. (I think some of the record skipping was my 
fault Sorry) it was totally worth $20. If any of you are in direct 
contact with those who put this on give them my total thanks for  a night 
of complete brilliance. (BTW like Jon I wasn't on anything all night 
except the irresistable force of the music compelling me to move, on and 
on and on. Thanks again.

I know this has been asked before, but I go to raves often and am concerned
about my hearing.  What type of earplugs are there out on the market?  Ask
far as being as unnoticable as possible, yet safe.  I still want to be able
to hear the music as well.  I heard that there is a type that filters out
the bad noise but the rest can be heard quite clearly, is this true?  Also I
heard that only high end noise damages the ear, is this true or can bass
also damage ears?  Responses are well appreciated!

Greetings,

if you all recall, the plan is to send an email to the white 
house on january 29, containing a copy of the bill of rights, 
etc.

if anybody's interested, i've built a small java-based program 
that can send any number of copies of a file to any location. 
i.e., you can tell it to send 1000 copies of the same file to 
the same email location.

i call it "spammer"

it's a little dangerous to be spreading around, but i'd make a 
special version that only sends email to the whitehouse, if 
anybody's interested <grin>

let me know

best,
wpr

 Matt-this has become fast concern for me too.... I've found that the generic
store bought kind that are yellow and spongy do the trick:). I've used 
these for the past 3 months and have had no problems,ex.-ringing in my ears-
after I went home... Your hearing is a precious thing- don't fuck with it 
people!

Could anyone on the list send me the phone of these two?  I have a friend
in Portland interested in booking them.  If you could pass it on that would
be great!

I just hadda get my 2 centz in....

I spent most of the afternoon over at the ambient jungle gym at friends 
and family.  Yes, I am an ambient fiend!!!

Andrew started out and was great.  Then Ronan went on and completely blew 
my mind.  Ronan, you were right on yesterday!  Then Fred mellowed me out 
even further with some reggae inspired dub.  And then Clair got spacey 
and beautiful with mind-altering music.  Yes, it was cold, yes it rained, 
but it just made the mood more perfect.  Tod, Sarah, Philip and I danced 
and huddle under blankets all afternoon, and then trucked over to Gaby 
and Billy's for a wonderful evening listening to music and hanging out.  

It was the first time I'd heard Clair play.  She gets my vote for playing 
at the next party.

I just hope the tapes come out okay!  Because I wanna listen to it again 
and again.

And many thanks to Joe, for not tearing down the system even when the 
wind and rain picked up.  And for bringing the system in the first place 
and to Monty and everyone else who helped set up.

Seeyou soon,

Ann

 Well as far as Ive ever investigated...all frequencies can damage your hearing...120dB of a 
high tone will hurt...while 120dB of bas feels g.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.d :) But the fact is 
they're both super loud sounds.
 Here in Canada if you work in a place that you need these, workers comp pays for them 
(such as in a nightclub), or they pay for half or something.
 A docotr pours this warm wax stuff in your ear..he gets a shape of the inside of your ear, 
then makes a very small clear hearing aid shaped plug. Supposedly you could be infront of a 
nice stack of speakers and the person next to you wouldnt even have to raise their voice for 
you to hear them. Now how true it rrrrrrrrrreally is I dont know...everybodies hearing is 
different...my friends absolutley swear by them.
 Here they're around $100.
 So, look around..go to your doctor and ask :)

Hi everyone!

Over the past 6 months or so I've made a number of new sections and changes
to the SFRaves web site that never got officially announced or anything,
so if you haven't seen it, or haven't gone to it for a long time, here's
a list of what's there now.  Suggestions for new sections or other info
is welcome, although I may not be able to work on some things right away.
If anyone wants to work on a section, we may be able to arrange for access to
the web server.

The home page has links to all of the major sections, a link to a 
"shocked" page, and links to local rave-related web sites (Ameba,
Frequency-8, Wicked, etc) and links to a few other areas' rave pages.

Yellow pages: a list of phone numbers to parties, clubs, rave-related
        businesses and hotlines.
White pages: a compilation of the "biographies" posted by members several
        months ago (compiled by John Darrow).
Archives: copies of all messages posted to SFRaves in its history
History: a short summary of the history of SFR
Flyers: a directory of scanned flyer images
Photos: a directory of images of people and parties 
Map: A map of central SF with markers for key stores and clubs - good for
        visitors...
Demos: Currently just one file, a demo of my interactive turntable setup
Documents: a directory of a few 'administrative' files

and of course, the latest version of the SFR calendar.

There are two types I know of, that insert in the ear (most unnoticable). 
Those are disposable (bad enviromentally) and non-disposable. You can 
hear the music fine with either. Toilet paper, wadded into a little ball 
works well also.

Any frequency can damage the hearing mechanism if too loud for too long.

Here is the scoop-- There are two types of sound that damage hearing.. 
loud, percussive sounds that happen suddenly with no warning (gunshots 
etc.) and sustained, loud sounds. What happens is that your ear canal 
thickens when exposed to loud sounds in order to protect itself. Sudden 
loud sounds do not allow the canal enough time to adjust. Long durations 
cause the muscles to tire so that they cannot filter the loud sound well. 
Also, the little hairs in the choclea (please forgive my spelling) that 
bend in response to sound and stimulate the nerves that tell your brain 
that you are hearing that particular frequency (different hairs for 
different frequencys) will break with use and age-- broken hairs do not 
respond to stimuli (sound). This is why you can have partial hearing loss 
at certain frequencys but not others. Protect your hearing!!!!

Personal walkman type cassette decks and CD players (earplug type) are 
probably the worst thing for your hearing. Turning up your car stereo to 
cover traffic noise is not good either--especially if done on a daily 
basis (commuters are you listening?) and/or in a very noisy car.
                                      (peace out)

But only if you are working from an 8 track master recording...
If you are trying, let's say, to take the lead vocal out of a tape of 
Street Fighting Man by the Rolling Stones that you dubbed off your CD, 
this plan won't work.  However, if you are lucky enough to have an 
8-track master (eg. guitar on track 1, bass on track 2, drum and rhythm 
on track 3, etc.) you can take out and put back in whatever you want...

Most hearing damage happens an octave to two above the frequency of the
damaging sound.

This means that mid-bass (200-500Hz) is probably the most damaging thing as
it will cause you to lose your hearing in the voice range.

It's in "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" off "Thriller". For an amusingly

The whitehouse sysadmin posted on Usenet a few weeks ago, saying
that the system is set up to only accept a certain number of
messages before defering them.  They will sit on your host machine
until the whitehouse.cgov can take them.  It also filters out 
"spams".

Save your effort for a meaningful protest, not a childish prank.

Friends and Family and Techno Temple
A Review by Crunchman

The Friends and Family outdoor daytime party WENT OFF despite the
rain that started towards the evening.

After getting there late to Friends and Family,  an outdoor daytime
rave/get together,   we find about 150 SFRavers and friends groovin
to some pretty good trancey tunes.

After about a half hour,  it started to rain,  but we had adequate
warning as the covers were put up and adjusted to protect the
speakers from the rain.

There was no dry place to sit down,  so danced all the time,
managing to keep reasonably dry.   Keeping warm wasn't a problem,
due to the excellent music and continuously dancing.

At some point,  the music had faded down slightly,  and I hear others
say the police had arrived,  but apparently we were allowed to
continue until the park closed.    I suppose the cops probably thought
we were crazy to be dancing out in the rain,  but that's just fine with
me,  as long as I was able to dance.

After the rave ended,   we headed out for dinner and checked the
directions to "Techno-Temple".

TT was in this new venue,  a dance studio in the Mission in SF.   The
Gangsta factor was high,   and those many that knew me were happy
to see me,  gave me the "high five" and were happy to see me,  and
told me they haven't seen me in a while.   Which was probably true,
because I've been attending more of the "Underground" events,  and
I don't like giving extended reports on Underground events for
obvious reasons.

We get there about 11 PM,   and about 50 people in line to get in.
We were told it hasn't started yet,  but we could hear the music
going full bore.    Eventually we get in and learn it was $20 (Ouch!).
Score yet another point for Promoter greed.   If they had put the
admittance fee on the flyer,   nobody would show up,  but they didn't
even put the price on the info line.

As soon as we go in,  we were hit with the heat and humidity in the
place.    Already,  there were 900 people inside,  and it was packed.
Score another point for the lies I received at the door when this dude
said it hadn't started it,  and all the time,  there was 900 people at
the door.

Being dressed for cold weather,  I quickly shed my layers,  but not
fast enough to avoid being soaked to the skin in sweat and I haven't
even started dancing yet.

"Time to check this place out!",   as I say to myself,   and proceed to
walk around.   Hearing this awesome trance music coming from the
smaller (And much cooler) room,  I make a bee-line for it,  and
immediately start dancing.   Great trance!!   Didn't see very many
SFRavers in there,  but Brian would have really dug the trance,  but
didn't see him there.   Excellent music,  ALL NEW,  and fresh cuts I
haven't heard before.   Getting DJ information was tough,   nobody
standing by the turn tables know who he was,  and I didn't want to
bother the DJ because he was so focused on his set.

It didn't take me long to be totally wet,  so it didn't take me long to
discover the fan,   and worked my way over to it.

Eventually,  I left the trance room and started exploring.   Through
another door,  I find the "Chill room" and amazingly enough,  the chill
room was cool (They had a window open to the outside world).  I
found a place to stretch and do some yoga,  before heading out
through yet another door to the main room and learn that this DJ
from the UK was spinning some good house.

The main room was stifling hot,  and could only dance in there about
15 minutes before getting totally drenched.   Even a fan offered little
relief,  provided you could even get near the fan.   Over to one side
was a really cool rap circle and some amazing agility was
displayed as some people were twirling on their heads.   One of my
Gangsta type friends asked me to join,  but I politely declined and
headed out for the cooler air.    By that time,  I had made full circle
and started to look for the men's room.   Yet another score for the
thoughtless promoters,  as I discovered this huge long line for just
ONE shitter and ONE urinal (YUKK!!)...  Now I know why a lot of the
SFRavers had avoided this rave.    Sheesh!!   Someone should have
told me....

I hang out in the entrance area for a while as it was the ONLY place
where the temperature was BELOW 100 degrees.

At some point,  the music in the main room stopped.   I hear some
spacey narration,  and I go in to see what was going on.   Just as I get
there,  I hear this much faster music starting up.   WOW!!  Real
Techno,  and the FAST KIND...   I mean,  it wasn't any 160+ BPM stuff,
but it was certainly faster than house.    I estimate 145+.

Wow!!  The music in the main room was faster than the trance
playing in the other smaller room.    I eventually head back through
the chill area to hear some amazing Jungle playing in the chill room.
WOW!!!  Really good and much faster jungle.   In the trance room,
things were getting INSANE...   It had filled up with more people,
and was getting off big time.    A different DJ was spinning,   but I
didn't care to go find out who he was,   I was entranced with the
music.   My friends were going ballistic,  bouncing off the walls.

I don't know how long I was in there dancing,   but eventually I
stopped and headed back to the main room to find that the BPM's
had picked up even more,  but minus the rap circles,  and not as
many people.   But being in San Francisco,  land of the low BPM's I
often call it,  this faster paced music is not very common.   Many of
my friends were all commenting,  saying "This music was much
faster than I like".   Me,  I just grinned and said "Yea!!  gimme more"

At about 5 AM,  the Trance room was FULL ON with good Goa trance,
somewhat harder than what Goa Gill plays.   By then,  the main room
slowed down to House again,   but the number of people were much
less,  but still no relief from the heat and humidity.   Shortly around
6 am (2 hours before the advertised ending time),   he music
stopped.    So we gathered our stuff and left.   My score...  in the
usual 1-10 scale

Venue = 3 (poorly ventilated,  no ins-and-outs,  inadequate toilet
facilities, and the list goes on)

Music = 8 (Excellent variety,  international DJs)

Sound = 7 in trance room,  6 for main room,  but sound went out a
few times.

Chill = 6 (they had their windows opened to the outside world)

Toilet = 2 ( see text above)

Visuals = 5 (Average)

	I just wanted to post a quick note especially thanking John (I 
didn't get your last name) for bringing the hot chocolate and tea for 
everyone on Saturday!  My friends & I really appreciated...
	Just getting over a cold, I was really pondering my wisdom at 
being out on chilly, windy, wet Point Molinas Saturday, and having a nice 
hot beverage there was a big plus!		
	Overall, I would have to say the party lacked the energy of past 
Friends & Family events, but considering the time (day), the weather 
(rotten) and the cost (free), I'm not complaining.  I do wish that 
someone had pointed out the ambient area to my friends & I.  It was 
mentioned on the voicemail, but when we got to the site I more or less 
assumed it wasn't happening.  You guys hid it too well!  It probably 
doesn't help that we got there when it was getting dark.  Too bad though, 
because it was my friend Liz's first rave, and she indicated that 
she would've liked some auditory relief from the throbbing techno of the 
main area.
	Anyway, phat hugzzz to all who came & made it possible. (Did I 
just spell "fat" with a "ph"??)     8)-

Much Love,

This will only work if you've got the original 8 track digital source
media used by the performers prior to mastering. And they happen to be
using the same 8 track digital recorder you have, etc. (Good luck
getting the masters unless the musicians are your friends or your a
bang-up big-name producer that knows how to swing deals w/ record cos.)

To answer the question originally asked (as i remember it), no it's
very hard to separate a LP/CD-source of music back into the separate
tracks. I've seen ads in music mags for electronic gizmos that remove
vocals from tracks (e.g. for karaoke) but I doubt they work very well.
Probably nothing more than a "notch" filter that removes the voice
spectra and leaves just the low bass and high highs... leaving your
ears to reconstruct the original sound while your brain fools you into
thinking there isn't a gaping hole in the frequency specrum.

Why don't you just play the needed tracks yourself or hire musicians to
do the job. Musicians need employment you know...

Yeah, but Phred was there and he put on a really good set ending off with a 
cut from "Havana Condensed".  He felt the mix was sloppy, but I still 
commended him on his choice of cuts.  

That was my first time to MAD.  Not what I expected, really, but then it 
*is* in the Bahia.  Small, but not claustrophic, ok lights, nice visuals, 
really good music and a surprisingly good vibe.  I mean, I had a grin on my 
face the whole time.

Got to meet the one, the only, Brian Darkness (trumpets) at MAD.  He 
graciously gave myself and a friend a gift for which I shall have to repay 
him in the very near future.  (big ole grins...)

He's only the second person I've seen from this list -- good thing he had 
his laminate!!  This time I decided I was going to have a meaningful chat, 
and I ended up dragging him outside to talk to him.  Very cool guy!

I also had a chance to prevent a little violence.  This happened on the way 
to the Bahia.  I saw a guy getting picked on by a larger, intoxicated man.  
I told my friend to pull over quick.  I jumped out, told my friend to circle 
the block and come back to pick me up.  I ran back, pretended like the guy 
getting swung at was a friend, "Hey man, been waiting long?!"  Big disarming 
grin, grabbed him by the sleeve and pulled him away, started walking down 
the street.  The big guy, almost coherent, kept yelling and was following 
us.  I made like I had understood part of what he was gibbering about, and 
laughed like it was really funny, "Is that right!  Yeah, I bet!  Ok, well, 
see ya later, pal!" and kept on walking away.  This, along with that big ole 
grin, confused the big guy enough that he decided that two guys, one of 
which wasn't that small, were too much of a headache, and he walked away.  
The guy I was walking with thanked me profusely and about a block further 
down, plenty of distance, we shook hands and parted ways.  Why am I 
including this?  Because sometimes to preserve PLUR (if I may be so bold as 
to apply it in this fashion), we have to step up and act when something bad 
is happening.  And sometimes all that's required is standing up and being 
counted, participating in even a small way to the solution.  I've never been 
good at "staying out of it".  "Getting into it" is an affirmation of life 
and humanity for me, an opportunity to help and to put smiles back on 
people's faces.

Toodles,

S

The Chrysalis flyer says 3/2/95 as the date of the event.  Someone please
correct this!  Also, the voicemail gives the date of the upcoming event as
April.  What gives?  Isn't it supposed to be this Saturday?  Did we time
warp ahead without my knowledge?  (I know I'm not always observant, but
come on...)

Hip me, y'all!

It is very hard to do, although you can get close if you use a
program like Sound Designer.  Those gizmos in the magazines take
the left channel and invert the waveform of the right channel and
mix those together to cancel everything that was panned dead center
in the music.  The reason: In mixdowns it is typical to keep the
vocals dead center and pan the different instruments slightly left and
right for spatial effect.  So cancelling out the center removes the vocal
(and a kickdrum or two) and leaves the basslines and whatever else might
be there (echo and effects).  This can be done with a digital audio
editor, just invert one of the channels and mix them together.

although to start, you should look for sections of the song that
have the beat and bassline and cut and paste those bars over sections
where the voice is.  You can often get pretty close doing this, although
you're bound to have a few parts that sound just off... oh well...

the only other option is making the music yourself from scratch.

good luck-

-john.

I think the way those "vocal removers" work is that they are based on
the prinicple that vocals are usually recorded to both stereo
channels, and the backing instruments tend to be more on the left
channel or the right channel.  By subtracting the output coming from
both channels simultaneously, and leaving the left or right channel
only output, one can decrease sounds recorded in the center.  I don't
know how this works in practice.

SDream wrote his story about helping out a stranger on the street who was
getting bulllied, and said ..... "Because sometimes to preserve PLUR (if I may
be so bold as to apply it in this fashion), we have to step up and act when
something bad is happening.  And sometimes all that's required is standing up
and being counted, participating in even a small way to the solution. 

To which I say...  RIGHT ON -- there are so many ways we can insert our positive
selves into negative situations creatively and nonthreateningly -- if he'd
jumped in and been aggressive or judgmental, things could have turned worse, but
being positive and just shifting the events and energy can totally make a
difference -- 

I was at a party in Seattle a couple of weeks ago and there was this guy who was
way gone (he later stripped naked and wandered around, that's how far gone he
was) and he decided he loved this girl there and just kept getting closer and
closer, staring at her, and though she was trying to be nice, it was scary -- so
I just stepped in and put my arms around her, giving her a big hug and asking if
she wanted my help, which she did -- and was able to divert him from her long
enough for her to make an easy exit --  not as potentially scary as SDream's
situation, but it still could have gone a different direction --

Thanks, and I hope you or someone like you is comin' along when I need a little
positive diversion to take me out of a negative!

Ok,  me and Craig decided that we would want to go,   so we will send you
a check sometime tommorrow (As soon as rain stops and we can get down to
the post office).

Then,  there is this big problem of not having a car,  so if you could take
the time to gather up those people driving who are willing to take on
additional people,   it would make it possible for us "car-less" folks to
take the trip.

I live in Marin,  but can get to SF if more convenient for the driver,  but
we would rather meet somewhere along the Golden Gate Transit line on Lombard
or South of Market.    Getting to the Haight takes us an hour longer.

So,  Steve,   if you can help me get a ride to this sierra cabin,   I'll
go ahead and drop the check to you in the mail tommorrow.   How much was it?
$25?   $20?

Thanx

They all SUCK BIG TIME,  here in the Bay Area.   How can be reverse this
dispicable distinction of being one of very few radio station markets that
DON'T have a 24 hour/7 days Techno,  House,  AMbient,  Acid Jazz format?

Large commercial radio stations only fucus on "Established" formats that
sell products,  but Live 105 has (or had) the Masters Mix every evening at
9 pm,  but when I tune in,   I sure don't get techno.   I guess it's not
on every day.   Of course KZSU has these House Marathons every so often,
but their signal coverage is small.

Is there any way that we,  as a group of people,  who are interested in
hearing (and supporting) techno on the radio.    Free Radio is ONE solution,
but won't be effective in ALL areas,  and then,  there is the FCC to contend
with.

Other solutions,   might be to approach commercial radio stations and talk to
their station managers and program directors to see if they could try the
format out for a set period of time.   Remember,  All radio stations want
to do,  is to sell Commercial time,  IE:  to make money.

I propose the following,  and would like to volunteer my knowledge of radio
station anatomy to the SFRave community in the hopes that it might actually
result in hearing a good DJ do a weekly show for 3 hour sets or even one
every day.

First step is to convence the station mananger that Techno/House music
is popular.   A good approach would be to make an appointment with the
dude,  perhaps over lunch,  down in the Haight.   Take him (the station
manager) into Ameba,  Frequency-8,  and other rave related stores,  and
ask him to count how many vehicles are blaring out Techno and House toons.

Perhaps Ameba or Frequency-8,   or a host of other rave proprieters would
be willing to pay for commercial time to "Sponsor" such a program.   Radio
station money mongers eat this shit up BIG TIME!!.

You just have to convince the station manager that Rave music SELLS COMMERCIALS
and I'm certain that Martin O Brian,  Wicked,  and other promoters would
like to have their events promoted on these shows.

I used to work in radio in another lifetime,  from programming to engineering,
and am familiar with the anatomy of such.   I also used to be a DJ on KKUP
Cupertino,  back in 1970.

As to which radio station to approach,  I would try for stations that already
play techno like Live 105,   or the hip hop station at the top of the dial,
whatever that is...

Lets see what we can do...

SUBJECT: Radio stations and formats

  Another station that plays house/techno is KSJS, 90.5 FM.
  It's played on some mornings (somewhat random mornings it seems -
  but usually when Tyler is the dj - she's rather cool).
  Their number is (408) 924 KSJS I believe.  That's the DJ/request line.

  As you might be able to tell from the letters, it is SJSU's station,
  thus limited coverage area, mostly the South Bay.

why?

I don't see any reason to turn a community like this one into an on-the-air
fully sponsored business extravaganza.

If there were a radio station devoted to techno, we'd be in the same
situation as Europe-- techno is huge over there, and they have radio
stations devoted to the format, and the result is that raving has become a
big business instead of a community like I believe it should be (that's
just my opinion though)...

I can't even begin to count how many tight undergraound music genres have
been ruined by overexposure on commercial radio and mTV and the like... In
a few years, everyone would be complaining about how techno used to be cool
before it sold out, and every rave would be attended by massive amounts of
twits who have no idea what the community atmosphere's about, they just
want to get down, get doped up, and get laid. Look waht happened to
Berkeley's punk scene when Green Day hit it big... they scene was exploited
by radio and record companies and Mtv who were searching for another image
to sell to the masses of uncreative teens begging for a prepackaged image
to buy.

Commercial rave radio would be sooo bad IMHO. If everyone could just flip
on KRAV whenever they wanted to, what would be the incentive to seek out
the real underground parties?

	Underground parties have always been around and they always will
be. I have been to some really good parties in the UK yet techno is nearly
as mainstream as blur. There was a term for the dodgy folks who were into
techno but looked the look and sported the hard attitude cuz they were
everywhere. And you look around here, its a community to a certain degree
but we don't have the likes of what the travellers in Europe do or the
roaming party that goes up and down the coast of India is rumored to have.
	Is the "community" that has come out of rave based on the music or the
people within the community? And why does the music have to stay hidden
(well, besides the fact that that one special track will most likely get
played every half hour til you want to stomp your radio to bits if its a
commerical station). If you are worried about the community breaking up, I
doubt that would happen but it might move a bit.

As a DJ on KDVS, the UC Davis campus radio station, I would like to give 
a big up to John for his comments.  KDVS is primarily (right or wrong) a 
punk/indie rock station.  However, there was a big push a while back and 
the hip-hop folks made their claim on a few slots during the programming 
cycle.  Nowadays, myself and acouple of others have been trying to get 
techno/house/rave/whathaveyou into the more respected spots (eg. not 3am, 
eternal or not, nobody listens at 3 on wednesday...).  The biggest thing 
that would help out a show like mine on KDVS (I will be back on the air 
starting next quarter) would be sponsorships!  Since KDVS is a 
non-commercial station, you wouldn't get "commercials" per se, but you 
would get mentions for having sponsored the show.  I am not trying to 
plug for sponsors, but I am trying to impart my knowledge of how our 
station works...
I have done sub. shows for other DJ's during non-vampyre hours and had 
bunches of callers really excited asking if KDVS is going to be playing 
house/techno at htis time on a regular basis and I have to tell them no, 
you have to tune in between three and seven am if you want to hear this 
stuff here.  I _know_ that there would be a big listener base in KDVS's 
broadcast range for a reasonable hour techno program.  The problem is 
convincing the program director (who really really really dilikes techno) 
that he should take the risk and put me on.
Anyway....

The next best thing to radio, I've discovered through my stays at Wayne's, is
Digital Music Express.  It is nonstop music with no commercials and they 
have a dance music station and one that is more ambient, but leans on the 
New Age side.  The dance music station is actually pretty decent!  It is 
really good if you want music in your house all day with no 
interruptions, and the remote control that comes with it shows the 
artist, title and the name of the record/CD or whatever.  I know I want 
it when I move to the city. 

love,
Amy

Uh, sorry........

The real date for Chrysalis is Saturday, March 2nd, 1996. We also seem to
have left the phone # off of this week's calendar. It's (415) 536-9453.
Thanks for wondering.

There are a lot of aging hippies(and some new ones) that would agree with 
you. They endure, and I respect them for that. However, they had to deal 
with the mass commercialization of their scene and wait for the 'fad' to 
pass. 

Any scene can and will be commercialized once enough people realize that 
they can make a buck off of it. It happened to the hippies, it happened 
to the 'alternative' scenes, and to a lesser degree the punk and gothic 
scenes. It is to a small degree commercialized in the U.S. which will 
most likely increase with the influence from Europe, and when more people 
realize that they can make a dollar off of the 'scene.' 

Endure. What you will be left with is all the wonderful people that 
mattered in the first place.

You may change your mind when the parties you are used to go to are swamped
by idiots who do not understand what the vibe or the community is about
but basically go there because it is the in thing to do. I saw this happen
in The Netherlands were the rave scene became huge within a few years. Even
though underground parties still exist, I would say it is difficult to find
one with the same quality of people as I used to meet in, say, 1990.
And I have seen reports of raves on this mailing lists complaining about
the gangsta/prep boy/macho percentage of the audience of certain events.
Apparently these people already know where to be and how to act (not).
The same is happening to the Internet in a sence. Nowadays every idiot (no
offense meant to those who did) get a AOL account and still only a small
percentage of the people in the world is hooked up. I still prefer quality
over quantity but that's just my $0.02...

Later,

The Frying Dutchman

Mostly, worked.  But arriving in SF Friday night after another punishing
week of bad weather in Portland, I was hoping for some relief, and more
or less got it, though it is unseasonably cool in SF as well.

Friday night I checked out the Top, where the Hardkisses sponsor a weekly.
DJs were Graeme and Charlotte, and as usual I had a good time.  The old
house crew, those who still go out anyway, seem to be drifting towards
these kinds of gatherings these days . . .

Saturday was F&F . . . with any better weather luck, it would have been
wonderful, but merely really good will have to suffice I guess!  Over
at the ambient stage (a converted kids jungle gym at the park), each
DJ got different weather: Andrew got Clouds, Ronan got Sunshine, I got
Storm, and Claire got Moon & Stars.  Pretty weird how it changed like
that, but there you are.  Big thanks to Ann, Greg, Philip, Joe and
everyone else who battened down the hatches while I piloted the Ark
of Dub through the storm.  It got a little drippy there at the DJ
station but no big deal, and I played pretty nice dub and jungle.
Can't wait to hear the tapes!  

I liked the rest of F&F too, though I couldn't stay late because of
my ride leaving.  A good start to the outside scene for the year, and
I was very pleased to see lots of people come out for this one.  
Point Molate is an excellent location . . .

Saturday night I went to the Cafe Bastille in the Financial District in
SF for Vanilla Fudge, which is a semi-regular every-other-week-or so
house music oriented thing.  Upstairs are a bunch of very drunk French
people, and downtown is a really cool little area with tables and a
small dance floor and DJs Corey Black, Sunshine and Lee spinning old-skool
deep house.  Nice one!

oops, my bus is leaving, more l8r

Sorry this is kind of long, but that whole radio thing got to me!!! and I
dont mean to bitch, but this is how i feel:

I have a friend who works at one of the "alternative" radio stations here in
the bay area, she listens to all the new stuff that comes in, thats part of
her job.  anyway she was explaining to me that she talked to the music
director about getting some"techno" songs played on the air.  Music Director
is not hip to the idea.  True that good sounding music  = money, but that
good sounding music that sounds good to you and appeals to you better sound
good and appeal to the rest of the other 250,000 listners that are listening
along with you, otherwise that  = no money and poor ratings.  Thats exactly
why the Music Director at this particular station isn't hip to the idea of
techno on his station.....it won't sell, not on his station cause people are
more "rock" driven !! In Short, if the music doesn't sell to the listners
then ratings go down and less air time is bought for commercials.....so he
doesn't want to take any chances!!

and about the community of ravers that we now have...people who invest their
money and time into these parties are NOT in it for the love, or the
community !! Thats the biggest front ive ever seen, i hang out with some of
these people, do you think that they give their money away to the
"community"?! NOT !!  Have you seen the cars that these people drive??????
Theyre in there spliting and counting up the money the second the party is
over!!!  But i do believe that our community of ravers as a people, are about
love and a sense of community and all that good stuff....and yes i believe
that there are still some good people out there who actually throw parties
for the "community" and love and fun of it!!

About "techno" music becoming popular and extending to people who don't know
what raves are about.....IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED!!!!!!  Take a look around at
the next party you go to....raves are TRENDY!!!  They havent much gotten to
the underground parties, but they will!!!

hope i didnt offend anyone, sorry if i did

peace and love

Well, my friend returned from England with a CD that looks like it might 
be available here; He got it at an HMV.

It's called "Loops of Fury EP" and has "Loops of Fury", "(The Best Part 
Of) Breaking Up", "Get Up On It Like This", and "Chemical Beats (Dave 
Clarke Remix)". The cover has a speed skier with heavy motion blur. I'm 
not sure that this is the "limited edition" I had heard about, but it's 
enjoyable anyway.

You obviously don't know the people who put on Harmony, Beautiful People,
and Friends & Family.  They're starving students with big, open hearts, and
are NOT in it for the money, as they consider it a good night when they
break even (and they don't always do that well).  Please consider this,
that not all the people who put on these parties are profit hogs.  I think
you'll find agreement with my statement among some of the others out there
in sfraves land.

Hi everyone.

If you're not doing anything on Thursday night, please come listen to some
great music.

Cindy Talk can only be discirbed as experimental gothic folk, I guess.  Gordon
(the singer) has played with the likes of This Mortal Coil and Coctou Twins. 
He pretty much has that 4AD sound.

Opening for Cindy Talk is Astronout.  A south bay Ambient/experimental trip.

Thursday night at 1015 Folsom.  

-M

They will also be playing at The Brass Rail (no, not the strip club) on the
Santa Clara Univercity campus on Sunday, March 3rd.

The formats of the redio stations in the bay area represent the whole United

all across the U.S.

I think I would throw up if I heard Live 105 play techno.  Let them play
they're cheezy, mainstream, pop house music.  It wouldn't make sense for
a pop rock station to play underground music.  Underground music is reserved
for the underground scene.

But how popular is it reallY?  The dance music market in America represents a
small fraction of the whole music market

Modern day *commercial* radio stations determine their formats and programming
schedules based on professional market research.  Programm Directors don't
program their daily playlist based on what *they* think is popular.  In addition
to in house, or contracted market research, they readradio trade publications 
like CMJ to figure out whats hot.

Comerial time is VERY, VERY and I repeat... VERY EXPENSIVE.

> You just have to convince the station manager that Rave music SELLS COMMERCIALS

I can appreciate your feelings about trying to push the music to another level.
But think twice about who you are trying to promote this music to.  They do not 
appreciate the music.  They don't have a passion for it.  As techno fans,
we must understand that we (americans) are a minority in the world of pop  rock
music. And thats the way it should be.  I would be so pissed if I heard a
Maurizio track right after a green day song on live 105.

The pop music arena cannot put a finger on the undergound techno|house scene because
the glitter and glamour of rock and roll is absent.  Producers are satisfied by 
remaining faceless.  A common theme of the music and culture is secrecy, which
contradicts the pop market.  

I think it would be a good idea if there was a mix show on a weekend night, but I 
disagree that we should get together and "sell out" by forcing cheezy commercial
radio stations to play the underground music that we love on a 24 hr basis.  FREE
RADIO is definately a good idea.

There are those of us that feel this has already happened, even in this
"underground" scene.  Drug use of many flavors has overtaken many people's
reasoning for enjoying these parties.

It is inevitable that rave music will be big business.  Thats why most people
start a business.  To make money.  But we should not support the commercialism
of this culture.  NO fucking way.

Or how 'bout supporting the people who give you the music.  Buy cd's, mix 
tapes, records.  Why should radio stations get big money, when talented
artists are struggling.  FORGET IT!

The chorus from Don't Stop Till You Get Enough is another good old MJ track to 
play. It always seems to give people a good little charge of +energy!
I went to open mike night at the bar I DJ at here in Sea, and I got the 
fortune of playing records along with a live band. Throwing in old JB samples 
and stuff. That was something I'd never really done. :)

That depends on where you are from.  The community that I am from is based on music.

> And why does the music have to stay hidden

Commercialism has a history of exploiting good music.  I don't think it's a bad 
thing that the music is hidden.  Look what happens when mainstream media gets into
promoting music that they know nothing about?  They push people like "Moby".  People
who have never heard the music before hear Moby, and they say:  Oh, that's techno,
that shit sucks.  Then everyone has the wrong impression of what the music really
is.  I am not against promoting the music, and introducing it to people who
aren't farmilliar, but it just has to happen in different ways.

Think about how terrible the vibe is at parties are when there are 5000 people.
Just imagine the first Live 105 Rave.

Ahem,

This may or may not be an opportunte time to mention it, 
but I and a few others have been working on an 
internet-based radio station catering to the techno scene.  
As far as I know, it's the only one in existence.

Your feedback would be appreciated.

Actually, SF area radio does *NOT* suck as John might imply. You certainly
won't find good music on commercial stations, but check out the college
stations for an incredible array of quality programming. 
For those who maybe don't read all the way down to the end of the SF Raves
calendar, I will reprint the radio listings from it:

     * Sunday night 11pm-2am - "The Dreaming/Innermind Show" w/DJ Miracle
       & Mr. Monchichi. House, Jungle, Trip-Hop, Ambient, Dub,
       Break-Beats & guest DJs. KSCU 103.3 (Santa Clara)
     * Thursdays 9:30pm-midnight - "Aurora Borealis" Beats and
       atmospherics w/DJ Seth. [20]KALX 90.7 (Berkeley)
     * Fridays 9pm-midnight - Andrew from Groove Merchant spins on
       [21]KUSF 90.3 (SF)
     * Friday night/Saturday morning - midnight-noon. House/techno mix
       with Johnny K, Ozone & guests - KCSS 91.9 Central Valley (Turlock)
     * Friday night/Saturday morning - "Just Desserts" w/Mr.Goodwrench -
       10pm-2am Ambient, Techno, Acid House, whacked-out Dub, Acid Jazz
       and noise [22]KFJC 89.7 - Los Altos Hills
     * Friday night midnight - Flux Television, Viacom Channel 47 -
       Ambient, acid jazz and house music videos & interviews. (415)
       281-3377. [23]flux@netcom.com
     * Friday night - nocturnal transmissions - featuring house DJs from
       SF and around the world. mid-2am, 107.7 FM (SF)
     * Friday night - Your Mama's House w/Pete Avila - 3am-5am, 106.1
       KMEL.
     * Friday night - Moondance. Ambient; 3am-7:30am, [24]KUSF 90.3 SF.
     * Saturday morning - "The Uncle Noah TV Show" 6-9am, KDVS 90.3,
       Davis.
     * Saturday afternoon - [25]"Bustop" - music and talk w/guest DJs
       from SF and beyond. 2pm-3pm. [26]KUSF 90.3 SF.
     * Saturday night - "Saturday Night Spin Out" w/Ronnie Libido. Trip
       hop, Jungle, Ambient, Experimental Sounds. 10pm-2am. [27]KFJC 89.7
       - Los Altos Hills

I think you get a pretty good bunch of music, and a wide variety.

And, to further drive home the point, KFJC 89.7FM in Los Altos Hills will be
broadcasting the Derrik May show *in it's entirety* from 10PM - 6am this
coming Friday. It will be live using ISDN technology, and will have excellent
sound quality. Here's the lineup:
 Friday, March 1st - space children presents [3]Prometheus Unbound
 Derrick May, Stacey Pullen, Gary O, Spacetime Continuum, Jon Williams,
 Graeme, Dutch, Das. Gardening Club w/Darkhorse, Professor Smith, U.F.O, Matty
& Abstract.

I'm pretty sure we will only broadcast the main room, so you will get Derrick
May, Stacey Pullen, Gary O, Spacetime Continuum, etc. (sorry Gardening
Clubbers...) KFJC's broadcast range is very wide, from the South Bay to North
of SF. You may want to check this out if you won't be going to the show, and
want to have and amazing set of DJ's spin at your house.

Anyway, if you don't like the musical selection, join a college station, get
involved, and start playing music yourself. It's pretty easy to do, and
basically takes time and devotion to something you enjoy.

Doug

where I was hired by BGP to be Bill Graham's personal producer for small events 
(mostly personal parties and fund-raisers at his residence).  Since Bill was 
friends with many of "The Dead" it was not uncommon to mingle with the likes of 
Jerry Garcia or Bob Weir.  As I'm not a Deadhead in any way, shape, or form I 
always found it a strange juxtaposition to go to a Dead show and listen to loving 
Deadheads in the parking lot talk about "f****n' capitalists" or the yuppies who 
were at that point "invading their scene for profit."  Then a week later I'd be 
at Bill Graham's mansion in the hills of Marin watching members of the Dead 
cruise up the driveway in Porsches and BMWs.

My point is this. To make the assumption that Bill Graham (promoter) or Jerry 
Garcia (player) were not in it for the love of the music or the community 
(Deadheads) would be wrong. They were lucky enough to make the passion of their 
life their business and to fill other people with happiness in the process. Pick 
an industry and the argument holds, Bill Gates (computers), Ken Grifffey Jr. 
(baseball), etc.

Making money at something isn't always bad.  Heck, in our market driven society 
money pays the rent people.  Think of all the great DJs and Promoters that we've 
lost over the years because they had to move on to something that does pay the 
rent and does have the future to pay for a child's food and education.  But I 
guess that they didn't really love the music as much.  Yeah right.

Are Deadheads and Ravers related? 
  
Just a thought...

Word, bro!  I can totally relate.  Many people, including myself, would
like nothing better than to make a living at what we love to do.  For me,
that means playing music for others' enjoyment.  If I could make enough $
at it to be comfortable, I'd give most of the rest of it to causes around
the world that really do some good for people.  As it is, I make very
little through performing, and to pay bills I often do work that holds no
passion for me, and doesn't benefit others in the way I want it to.  You
hit the nail right on the head: this is a capitalist society.  Those of us
who would rather not participate in it for moral reasons have to compromise
to a certain degree (at least till the revolution occurs...).  The only
alternative I can think of is to support oneself by theft, and that's NOT
acceptable.  Money is not the root of all evil; it's the lust after money.

My two shillings :)

Dear Jen,

	You haven't offended me, but I do wish you would attach some 
names to the above.  This would allow the rest of us to make more 
informed judgements about the truth of what you say, and perhaps give 
those mentioned a chance to tell their side of it, if they are available 
to do so.  Who are these greedy promoters?  If they're so bad, why do you 
hang out with them?  What kind of cars *do* they drive?  If what you say 
is true, I want to know so I can avoid their parties.
	A while back I posted on the importance of the free flow of 
information.  This is not a criticism of you, but I think it would be 
helpful in general if people would share the important info that they 
have.  If know a particular DJ, promoter, or party is bad news, by all means 
tell us!  If the word doesn't get out, we can't hope to improve the 
quality of our scene by discouraging the bad elements.
	In the same spirit Jen, I'd be curious which radio station you 
refer to above.  Surely there is no need to keep the station's identity, 
or that of your friend who works there or the music director hidden.  
Or is there?  If you feel there is, I'd like to hear that as well.

Peace, Luv & Grooviness,

Not true...  If a sponsor were to sponsor a special Rave show where rave
music is featured,  the radio station would have to go with it.   Remember,
we are trying to convince the radio station to ditch the playlist concept
in favor of providing a "Special" program,  sponsored by paying advertizers.
Without the paying adversizers,  this WON'T HAPPEN...   In commercial radio,
MONEY TALKS and BULLSHIT WALKS....

Lets not forget Levis Jeans...  They are real hip to trendy things,  perhaps
someone should try and approach them on the idea.

No No!!  The idea is not to commercialize the scene,   the idea is to
put rave music on the radio.   I suppose this might contribute to the
commercialzation of raving,   but I think that having a radio station
that plays a variety of rave music all day and night,  would be good
for the scene.

Well,  to some point,  that might be true...  I mean,  the SF Bay area is
probably the ONLY place where Rave music is NOT heard on the radio on a
regular basis.    Of course there are other areas like the deep South,
that may not have techno on the radio,   but in other countries,  even
Moscow,  they have 24 hour/day Rave music.

IMHO,  rave radio would cause the Underground scene to flourish even more,
but also,   if the radio part were done right,  I think it would contribute
to the scene.

Then,  we need an underground station (or pirate) to take a lead in this
and of course the risk,  and go on the air.     Then,  whatever happened to our

Right,  and these bozos should "Get with the program" and give techno a second
"Hard look",  talk to the people that want to hear it,  go to raves,  and
experience the music like we do.    Does anyone know of any such market research
company?

Yea,  thats the problem...  These people are so "dis-connected" with reality
most of the time.   In the past,  I had to deal with such bozo's and they are
probably the most clueless people on this planet,  other than the politicians.

Well,  you DO have a point,  but I wasn't actually thinking of using Live 105
to host a rave program,   but perhaps other smaller stations might want to
try it.    It won't hurt to talk with them.

I couldn't help but notice that someone mentioned programming radio shows 
based on what charts in the CMJ magazine.  Well, where does CMJ get those 
charts from?  I'll tell you!  It's from stations that submit their 
playlists on a wide variety of formats (country, Triple AAA, Adult 
Alternative, etc.) and then CMJ builds lists based on how many spins 
various tunes are getting.  It's not like some sort of MTV market 
survey.  Also, in case you haven't read CMJ (which I assume amny of you 
haven't since it's pretty much an industry rag) there is a section and 
chat called RMP that covers techno and industrial, but mostly techno.  
Now, let me give you a taste of what's charting on the CMJ RPM list:
top 10 as of 2/12/96
1) u-Ziq	In Pine Effect			Astralwerks
2) Various	Trip Hop Test Part Two		Moonshine
3) Various	Psychotrance3			Moonshine
4) Hardfloor	Da Damn Phreak Noize Phunk?	Harthouse-Eye Q
5) Frontline Assembly	Hard Wired		Metropolis
6) Various	Excursions in Ambience The 4th..Astralwerks
7) DJ Food	A Recipe for Disaster		Ninja Tune-Shadow
8) Chem. Bros.	Exit Planet Dust		Astralwerks
9) Leftfield	Leftism				Columbia-CRG
10) Keoki	Caterpiller (5")		Moonshine

also on this list is stuff from Astral Pilot, Loop Guru, Cygnus X, Goldie 
and Prototype 909 to name a few.  Now if a program director programmed a 
show from CMJ I think it would pretty much kick ass.  And I kjnow for a 
fact that once a record gets onto CMJ's top 25 RPM list, the distributors 
have _no_ problem sending out free copies, especially if your station 
reports to CMJ (which KDVS does! Yay!)
Anyway, just thought I would put in a couple more pennies...

here's a thought:
I know that profit motives can be ugly things, and sometimes it may
seem like the rave scene or the radio stations are becoming repulsively
commercialized, but there's a fundamental scientific law which I think
proves that the real vibe (pick your own definitions of real here)
won't ever go away: nature abhors a vacuum, and so as long as there is
desire for a better way, the better way will come.  If there's a vacuum,
a noticeable and palpable lack of the real vibe, those of us who want that
real vibe to exist will rush and fill that vacuum, and we will do it as 
quickly and as easily as possible, moving in the same way that water rushes
down the side of a hill: it takes the path of least resistance, and as 
water slides around rocks and branches that are in its way, ravers tiptoe
past unsympathetic police officers and duck under curfew restrictions,
on their way to finding the real vibe.  Any thoughts on this one?

Hmmm, (rubbing my chin in philosophical contemplation), I like to 
believe that there is an actual force pulling us into this vibe
you are talking about.  Your theory seems to say that good and
bad vibe will equal out.  So, if we were all ravers on this planet, 
there would be a bad vibe vacuum.  So, does this mean that a 
small subculture would duck the PLUR and have their own gatherings
and mailing lists where they talk about how all this PLUR stuff is
just not for them... that the universe is an evil, competive place,
where you can't get ahead by being nice, but instead by clawing your
way to the top of the heap?

Back to my mysterious force theory, what is it?  Maybe eons ago
aliens tampered with some people's genetic blueprint... a change that
would not manifest until triggered by an signal that indicating that
the planet had reached a certian level of technical knowlege.  This
signal, generated by technology, would get into these altered genes
and trigger a gradual, yet definate, change of mental outlook by those
affected.  Those affected would "see the light" ei, gain incredible
knowledge about the universe (as programmed by aliens so many eons earlier), 
and take it upon themselves to start building a better world based on
the newly-manifested knowledge.  Once enough people were "affected"
with this knowledge, the aliens would return to Earth and welcome
us humans (now a wonderful, happy, spiritual race that worked together) into 
the galactic community.

hey clinton (midwest dude) here again,

the college radio station i work at WSUP, has a show
which incidentally i work on  :)  that reports to the
RPM list also, unfortunately, we play tons more underground
tracks than we do stuff the record companies send us. so
our charts don't usually make the top 25  :P
but it's still fun knowing our selections have an effect on the
dance music industry!

clinton


p.s. thanks for all the responses to my post about my upcoming
trip to SF. i knew you were nice ppl before from reading your posts
but your kindness really came thru on the personal msgs!! 
i love you all!!

Sure we all need to eat, we all need to get by!  I don't have a problem
with people making money off what they like to do.  I have a problem when
money and the lust for it influences powerfull social/artistic/musical
trends thru  mass marketing which is what commercial radio(TV also) is all
about (after all,the true aim of marketing is to simply creats artificial
wants and needs.. )  Anyway whenever anything gets "big" and has mass
appeal it loses all quality, take fast food for example, Taco Bell vs. any 
independently owned Mexican resturant ,Mc Donalds, I mean is that place
really quality? no, it's mass produced for mass profits.  So can I compare
fast food and record labels? maybee, is Moonshine and United DJ's of
America really putting out the best and most original tracks? IMHO, NO.  I
guess the problems I'm talking about are deeply rooted in our capitalist
system and part of what makes the underground music scene so beautifull is
that to some extent it's not part of that system.  For-example, Carl Craig,
one of the most respected  techno artist around was at a little resturant
playing for a few(relative to a rock concert) people, I mean that's
community, no glamour, glitz, bodyguards, ect.
Anyway- big time mass marketed profit driven ________(fill in the
blank)=poor quality

P.S. Another subject:  When large companies(labels, promoters,radio
stations) are involved any values,ideas,politics ect. that are part of the
musical scene to be exploited  will always be ignored; they're just not
profitible and if they are ever emphasized by the company, well it will be
to make money off of it.(Levis web site)

Have Fun,
Mark

	I find it hard to believe that you have a community without 
people. I don't care how the community formed, my point was that the 
community is based or is made up of certain type of people and I think 
this is obvious from the paragraph before:

[begin my quote]
      Underground parties have always been around and they always will
be. I have been to some really good parties in the UK yet techno is nearly
as mainstream as blur. There was a term for the dodgy folks who were into
techno but looked the look and sported the hard attitude cuz they were
everywhere. And you look around here, its a community to a certain degree
but we don't have the likes of what the travellers in Europe do or the
roaming party that goes up and down the coast of India is rumored to have.
[end my quote]

	Now before you jump on me for saying a "certain type of people", 
look around at what a community is what what common features exist within 
a community because, in my terms, this is what makes a community. You go 
to India and you follow 5000 people up and down the coast who you didn't 
know a month before, you have to have one of a couple mindsets - either 
really fucking independent, or able to interact with people on a certain 
level and offer up certain parts of yourself, or a combination. Otherwise 
you are gonna be one lonely person in a big group and most likely die 
from exposure cuz the storms are gonna pelt on you and you can only abuse 
people so much before they are gonna say, fine, fuck off. What I see as 
community is that group interaction which keeps everyone alive and safe 
to a certain degree.

Yo Karen,  though it's not quite San Fran, Seattle, is only 3 hours away.
Please come down and play with us sometime!  =)  We average at least one
San Frandeejay a week and we're working on bringing up some friends and
family from SF sometime very soon! ;)

Hi y'all.  I'm a newbie to this group, so let me introduce myself. My 
name is Matt, but most of my close friends call me "Loaf" or "Da Loaf" 
(even though my girlfriend hates the name).  I'm from Santa Cruz and have 
been doing the rave thing in the Bay Area for about three years.  
Unfortunatly I usually don't have enough money to rave more than once 
every month or two.  Enough about me. My question is: I'm looking for 
mixes that some of the local DJ's (Jano, spun, Garth, etc.) might have 
made on CD.  I've seen Garht's "No Rest For The Wicked" CD, but that's 
it.  I'm also wondering where to buy them, especially if it's in the San 
Jose area (it's closer to home). Many thanks to any and all replies.
						  
							love,
							Matt
							  Da

I'll try to keep this short.  I started going to Dead shows when I was 15 (in
1985 eek!).  I did the whole Dead tour-road-trip thing all through high school
(in Wisconsin) and most of the way through college.  Needless to say, I was
seriously hooked on that whole scene.  Then, while I was in college (UCSC . . .
hi slugs!), a friend  took me to a Funky Tekno Tribe.  I HAVE NEVER HAD SO MUCH
FUN IN MY LIFE!  Funky Tekno had sense of unity and smiles that I loved (and
missed) from my early years as a kid on Dead tour PLUS some REALLY fabulous
music.  I had so much fun dancing and running around stamping everyone; to this
day I'm sure that I stamped EVERYONE at that party.  I felt like I had finally
found a really interesting, diverse group of people to groove with!  I think
that there is a whole lot of "cross-over" between the groups affectionately
called "Deadheads" and "Ravers".  (I've met neat ravers at Dead shows and neat
Deadheads at raves.)

I am currently interning on a radio station, kscs, on Erik Spire's show 
the Electric Sound Sanctuary.  The decent thing about kzcs is that it is 
public, and not for profit.  However, they are community oriented and 
have p.c. issues to contend to .  I don't know how supportive of a 
station that played all underground sounds I would be because it would 
then become more mainstream than ever, and allow others to profit from 
it.  I think the airplay of our music should be kept low key.  It is nice 
to be able to tune in to a particular show, but to hear it 24/7 would 
take a way some to the pleasure of hearing it live.  Songs get played out 
fast enough as it is at raves alone, let alone the possibility of hearing 
"sweet dreams" (hee hee)  more than deserves makes me ill. Maybe I am too 
nastalgic for the truly underground.  Is this unprogressive?  Well, maybe 
so, but I'd rather pop in the tape of any dj than even deal with 
commercial radio.

Hello everyone.  I'm on a bit of a historical quest.  I'd love to get my
hands on some old tapes, especially from parties, from the "era" 1990 to
1992.  Does anyone know someone/someplace that has this kind of stuff?  I
was also wondering who was spinning a lot back then?   Thanks.   Tom

I was exploring other places and ways to express myself for several years before
Jerry died and the rave scene is one very positive place I found where I can do the 
dancing, loving, hugging, wallow in the vibe type of thing in a safe friendly
enviorment.  

Thanks to everyone whos part of the positive light that glows around our scene.

 Yes - but ... it's too bad that musical tastes and prejudices probably keep
the groups apart more than getting them together.

 As for less than positive encounters , I've had 'em in both scenes. Mostly
rip-off artists attracted to large crowds , or folks who've taken too
many hits of who-knows-what . Still , I'd rather be at a rave or a Dead show
than , say , a death-metal rock concert triple header..

Fuck commercial radio. I don't want to listen to their annoying
advertisements or listen to their heavy rotation "modern rock" crap
shoved down the program manager's throat's via payola bribe scams set
up by the record companies. Play a song often enough and the crowd will
love it! They snach up those lame hit records at Tower to stop that
horrible Pavlovian drooling caused by some lame "hook" that they can't
get out of their head. (Sounds echo in their hollow heads, I guess!)

I don't need to be spoon fed techno in the same way. If the DJ's can
select their own material then that's great -- but that will never ever
ever happen at a commercial radio station. You gotta play those songs
off the "A list" over and over again or you get fired.

Because of that -- I try to listen to college, nonprofit, or public
radio exclusively. I don't care if nobody else does -- they can have
their "The Cure" or "Toto" or "Hootie and the Blowfish" or whatever.
It's all lame to me, and by properties of transitivity, people that
listen to this shit are pretty lame as well.

My favorite stations:
	KFJC (south bay, though I get it in SF) -- 89.7 FM
	KZSU (south bay) -- 90.1 FM
	KPFA (berkeley, fresno, etc) -- 94.1 FM

KFJC on Saturday Night 10PM-2AM has Ronnie Libido's "saturday night 
spinout" and he often plays excellent stuff -- techno, ambient, trip
hop non-lame industrial. ANother good KFJC DJ is "Mr. Goodwrench" who
also plays excellent ambient/techno/dub etc. On Sunday afternoon, KFJC
has some really good reggae/dub. And at 7PM-10PM on Sunday evening --
great conspiracy theory talk radio...

KPFA has some excellent shows as well in the evening (lots of talk
shows in the day with interesting left-oriented subjects). For example,
the other day, they had some excellent Latino "low riding" rap and or
drum/bass music. Doug Wendt has a great reggae show. Other times I've
heard good african "pop" shows, funk, etc. It all moves the booty with
niceness!

Well Niels, then there are a lot of really nice, intelligent people out 
there that you will never be able to relate to. How sad it must be to be 
you. 

Good music is whatever moves you.

Just gotta pop up & disagree with that little bit, just cause you like

Are Deadheads and Ravers alike? I went to my first Rave in Madison in 92
when I was 14 (it helps having older brothers).Then I hit my first Dead
show Spring of 93 in Chicago at the Rosemont Horizon. I ended up not coming
home for 6 months or so. The GD vibe then was very beautiful and loving.
We raged every city, especially on the west coast. Almost every hotel in a
five mile radius of the coliseum would be packed with Deadheads expanding
their minds, listening to music etc. I continued to follow the Dead off and
on for the next three years<in fact it's what brought me to San Franpsycho>
I was also hitting raves<Tx,Ill,NC,Ga,Or,> To get to the point....things
fell apart for the Dead scene, DEA<OPERATION DEADEND> were every where.
There was even a special task force at the Atlanta shows for people who
liked to explore there minds like myself called REDDOG's<run every drug
dealer out of Georgia!!Scarrry...I also noticed that allot of people
started shooting heroin etc. I pray that the same doesn't happen to the
Rave scene. I've actually noticed the vibe is getting better<I left to live
in Dallas and since I've been back the vibe has been much more loving
etc>We all need to stay positive and love one another...dance in
celebration of life in the tradition of the archaic way of life to the beat
of the music...and if your going to use drugs, use them as a catalyst to
your higher self.

Tonight (that is Fri Mar 1) there's a perty called Rize assumably in 
Sacto. Info line is 916.565.9588. Two rooms, lots of djs, many of them 
locals. I would guess its taking place at the Texas BBQ space, buts thats 
just an educated guess...

Doesn't the "C" in CMJ stand for "College" (College Music Journal,
right?) -- so by definition, good college stations will be figuring out
all the hip cool tunes for da youngins based on some of those
playlists. I know they do, and I think that's great.

Unfortunately, the "C" in CMJ doesn't carry over to the Commercial
radio world. Any Commercial radio DJ needn't bother wasting their time
reading up on the latest sounds because they have to play the crap the
program director told them to play or get fired. (And if the program
direkkktor doesn't tow the line, the rekkkid companies will stop
sending said program director that endless stream of cocaine and high
priced call girls that keeps them stupid, happy, and under the whip of
their masters). This, oh ecstacy-addled-ones, is how things actually
work in "the industry".

If anybody knows of a commercial radio station that plays stuff outta
CMJ, I'd like to hear about it. Cuz you know that Live 105, KMEL, and
all those other dunderhead stations plays stuff off off the DMJ
playlist  (dickhead music journal) which is some rag that circulates
among Sony/CBS/NBC/Warner/Westinghouse management ... eventually
resulting in David Letterman being forced to showcase lame "new" acts
like Pete Droge, Tadpole II Frog, or giving us fabulously vapid
soundtracks like that from "Waiting to Impale", "Spew-less", or
whatever.

FAIR Report:
PATRICK BUCHANAN -- IN HIS OWN WORDS
February 26, 1996                           Contact: Steven Rendall

In the flap over Larry Pratt and other unsavory characters
associated with the Patrick Buchanan campaign, journalists
typically framed the question: Is Buchanan linked to extremists and
bigots?  But there is a more basic question journalists should ask:
Is Patrick Buchanan himself an extremist and bigot?

Here is a sampling of Buchanan's views:

ON AFRICAN-AMERICANS

After Sen. Carol Moseley Braun blocked a federal patent for a
Confederate flag insignia, Buchanan wrote that she was "putting on
an act" by associating the Confederacy with slavery: "The War
Between the States was about independence, about self-
determination, about the right of a people to break free of a
government to which they could no longer give allegiance," Buchanan
asserted.  "How long is this endless groveling before every cry of
'racism' going to continue before the whole country collectively
throws up?" (syndicated column, 7/28/93)

On race relations in the late 1940s and early 1950s: "There were no
politics to polarize us then, to magnify every slight. The
'negroes' of Washington had their public schools, restaurants,
bars, movie houses, playgrounds and churches; and we had ours."
(Right from the Beginning, Buchanan's 1988 autobiography, p. 131)

Buchanan, who opposed virtually every civil rights law and court
decision of the last 30 years, published FBI smears of Martin
Luther King Jr. as his own editorials in the St. Louis Globe
Democrat in the mid-1960s. "We were among Hoover's conduits to the
American people," he boasted (Right from the Beginning, p. 283).

White House advisor Buchanan urged President Nixon in an April 1969
memo not to visit "the Widow King" on the first anniversary of
Martin Luther King's assassination, warning that a visit would
"outrage many, many people who believe Dr. King was a fraud and a
demagogue and perhaps worse.... Others consider him the Devil
incarnate. Dr. King is one of the most divisive men in contemporary
history." (New York Daily News, 10/1/90)

In a memo to President Nixon, Buchanan suggested that "integration
of blacks and whites -- but even more so, poor and well-to-do -- is
less likely to result in accommodation than it is in perpetual
friction, as the incapable are placed consciously by government
side by side with the capable." (Washington Post, 1/5/92)

In another memo from Buchanan to Nixon: "There is a legitimate
grievance in my view of white working-class people that every time,
on every issue, that the black militants loud-mouth it, we come up
with more money.... If we can give 50 Phantoms [jet fighters] to
the Jews, and a multi-billion dollar welfare program for the
blacks...why not help the Catholics save their collapsing school
system." (Boston Globe, 1/4/92)

Buchanan has repeatedly insisted that President Reagan did so much
for African-Americans that civil rights groups have no reason to
exist: "George Bush should have told the [NAACP convention] that
black America has grown up; that the NAACP should close up shop,
that its members should go home and reflect on JFK's admonition:
'Ask not what your country can do for you, but rather ask what you
can do for your country.'" (syndicated column, 7/26/88)

In a column sympathetic to ex-Klansman David Duke, Buchanan chided
the Republican Party for overreacting to Duke and his Nazi
"costume": "Take a hard look at Duke's portfolio of winning issues
and expropriate those not in conflict with GOP principles, [such
as] reverse discrimination against white folks." (syndicated
column, 2/25/89)

Trying to justify apartheid in South Africa, he denounced the
notion that "white rule of a black majority is inherently wrong.
Where did we get that idea?  The Founding Fathers did not believe
this." (syndicated column, 2/7/90) He referred admiringly to the
apartheid regime as the "Boer Republic": "Why are Americans
collaborating in a U.N. conspiracy to ruin her with sanctions?"
(syndicated column, 9/17/89)

ON IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR:

"There is nothing wrong with us sitting down and arguing that issue
that we are a European country." (Newsday, 11/15/92)

Buchanan on affirmative action: "How, then, can the feds justify
favoring sons of Hispanics over sons of white Americans who fought
in World War II or Vietnam?" (syndicated column, 1/23/95)

In a September 1993 speech to the Christian Coalition, Buchanan
described multiculturalism as "an across-the-board assault on our
Anglo-American heritage."

"If we had to take a million immigrants in, say Zulus, next year,
or Englishmen, and put them up in Virginia, what group would be
easier to assimilate and would cause less problems for the people
of Virginia?" ("This Week With David Brinkley," 1/8/91)

ON JEWS:

Buchanan referred to Capitol Hill as "Israeli-occupied territory."
(St. Louis Post Dispatch, 10/20/90)

During the Gulf crisis: "There are only two groups that are beating
the drums for war in the Middle East -- the Israeli defense
ministry and its 'amen corner' in the United States." ("McLaughlin
Group," 8/26/90)

In a 1977 column, Buchanan said that despite Hitler's anti-Semitic
and genocidal tendencies, he was "an individual of great
courage...Hitler's success was not based on his extraordinary gifts
alone. His genius was an intuitive sense of the mushiness, the
character flaws, the weakness masquerading as morality that was in
the hearts of the statesmen who stood in his path." (The Guardian,
1/14/92)

Writing of "group fantasies of martyrdom," Buchanan challenged the
historical record that thousands of Jews were gassed to death by
diesel exhaust at Treblinka: "Diesel engines do not emit enough
carbon monoxide to kill anybody." (New Republic, 10/22/90)
Buchanan's columns have run in the Liberty Lobby's Spotlight, the
German-American National PAC newsletter and other publications that
claim Nazi death camps are a Zionist concoction.

Buchanan called for closing the U.S. Justice Department's Office of
Special Investigations, which prosecuted Nazi war criminals,
because it was "running down 70-year-old camp guards." (New York
Times, 4/21/87)

Buchanan was vehement in pushing President Reagan -- despite
protests -- to visit Germany's Bitburg cemetery, where Nazi SS
troops were buried.  At a White House meeting, Buchanan reportedly
reminded Jewish leaders that they were "Americans first" -- and
repeatedly scrawled the phrase "Succumbing to the pressure of the
Jews" in his notebook.  Buchanan was credited with crafting Ronald
Reagan's line that the SS troops buried at Bitburg were "victims
just as surely as the victims in the concentration camps." (New
York Times, 5/16/85; New Republic, 1/22/96)

After Cardinal O'Connor criticized anti-Semitism during the
controversy over construction of a convent near Auschwitz, Buchanan
wrote: "If U.S. Jewry takes the clucking appeasement of the
Catholic cardinalate as indicative of our submission, it is
mistaken. When Cardinal O'Connor of New York seeks to soothe the
always irate Elie Wiesel by reassuring him 'there are many
Catholics who are anti-Semitic'...he speaks for himself. Be not
afraid, Your Eminence; just step aside, there are bishops and
priests ready to assume the role of defender of the faith." (New
Republic, 10/22/90)

The Buchanan '96 campaign's World Wide Web site included an article
blaming the death of White House aide Vincent Foster on the Israeli
intelligence agency, Mossad -- and alleging that Foster and Hillary
Clinton were Mossad spies. (The campaign removed the article after
its existence was reported by a Jewish on-line news service; Jewish
Telegraphic Agency, 2/21/96.)

In his September 1993 speech to the Christian Coalition, Buchanan
declared: "Our culture is superior.  Our culture is superior
because our religion is Christianity and that is the truth that
makes men free." (ADL Report, 1994)

ON GAYS:

In a 1972 memo to Richard Nixon, Buchanan referred to one of George
McGovern's leading financial contributors as a "screaming fairy."
(Newsday, 2/8/89)  Buchanan has repeatedly used the term
"sodomites," and has referred to gays as "the pederast
proletariat." (Washington Post, 2/9/92)

"Homosexuality involves sexual acts most men consider not only
immoral, but filthy.  The reason public men rarely say aloud what
most say privately is they are fearful of being branded 'bigots' by
an intolerant liberal orthodoxy that holds, against all evidence
and experience, that homosexuality is a normal, healthy lifestyle."
(syndicated column, 9/3/89)

In a 1977 column urging a "thrashing" of gay groups, Buchanan
wrote: "Homosexuality is not a civil right.  Its rise almost always
is accompanied, as in the Weimar Republic, with a decay of society
and a collapse of its basic cinder block, the family." (New
Republic, 3/30/92)

"Gay rights activists seek to substitute, for laws rooted in Judeo-
Christian morality, laws rooted in the secular humanist belief that
all consensual sexual acts are morally equal.  That belief is anti-
biblical and amoral; to codify it into law is to codify a lie."
(Buchanan column in Wall Street Journal, 1/21/93)

On AIDS, Buchanan wrote in 1983: "The poor homosexuals -- they have
declared war upon nature, and now nature is extracting an awful
retribution (AIDS)." (Los Angeles Times, 11/28/86)  Later that
year, he demanded that New York City Ed Koch and New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo cancel the Gay Pride Parade or else "be held personally
responsible for the spread of the AIDS plague."  "With 80,000 dead
of AIDS, our promiscuous homosexuals appear literally hell-bent on
Satanism and suicide," Buchanan wrote in 1990 (syndicated column,
10/17/90).  In the 1992 campaign, he declared: "AIDS is nature's
retribution for violating the laws of nature." (Seattle Times,
7/31/93)

ON WOMEN:

"Rail as they will about 'discrimination,' women are simply not
endowed by nature with the same measures of single-minded ambition
and the will to succeed in the fiercely competitive world of
Western capitalism." (syndicated column, 11/22/83)

"The real liberators of American women were not the feminist
noise-makers, they were the automobile, the supermarket, the
shopping center, the dishwasher, the washer-dryer, the
freezer." (Right from the Beginning, p. 149)

"If a woman has come to believe that divorce is the answer to
every difficult marriage, that career comes before children
... no democratic government can impose another set of values
upon her." (Right from the Beginning, p. 341)

ON DEMOCRACY:

Attacking what he considers the "democratist temptation, the
worship of democracy as a form of governance," Buchanan commented:
"Like all idolatries, democratism substitutes a false god for the
real, a love of process for a love of country." (Patrick J.
Buchanan: From the Right, newsletter, Spring/90)

In a January, 1991 column, Buchanan suggested that "quasi-
dictatorial rule" might be the solution to the problems of big
municipalities and the federal fiscal crisis: "If the people are
corrupt, the more democracy, the worse the government." (Washington
Times, 1/9/91)  He has written disparagingly of the "one man, one
vote Earl Warren system."

In Right from the Beginning, Buchanan refers to Spanish dictator
Francisco Franco as a "Catholic savior."  He called Franco, along
with Chile's Gen. Pinochet, "soldier-patriots."  (syndicated column
9/17/89) Both men overthrew democracy in their countries.

Buchanan devotes a chapter of his autobiography -- "As We Remember
Joe" -- to defending Senator Joe McCarthy. He advocated that Nixon
"burn the tapes" during Watergate, and he criticized Reagan for
failing to pardon Oliver North over Iran-contra.

Buchanan, shortly before he announced he was running for president
in 1995: "You just wait until 1996, then you'll see a real right-
wing tyrant." (The Nation, 6/26/95)

maine.  i started listening to the dead that summer then they played down 
the street from my house...what an adventure that was! if you like the

singer with a NE based dead band called the "broken men" for a few 
years.  boy, was that a fun time.  but, i really like the dead/techno 
crossover...i think it's really neat.  like, before i startd listening to 
techno i read alot of terrance mckenna then was surprised to find of his 
involvement with space-time continuum...for me i just never knew this 
world existed and it was (and still is) very exciting for me!  so it's a 
good blend :)

In reply to ..... Are Deadheads and Ravers related?

Even though I'm of an age that I could have been one of the very early
Deadheads, I never really got into the Dead or the Deadhead culture ...  and
then later in life, I was irresistably pulled into the rave scene.. and last
summer I had a chance to reflect on the similarities and differences ...

I went to a Kundalini party up in Washington a few hours south of Seattle in a
place called Rainbow Valley, which is a beautiful green secluded valley where
lots of Deadheads live, there are old schoolbuses and vans parked around, and
they have a whole community there..  and they lease (I guess) it to ravers for
parties ...  really a beautiful environment.

Some of the resident Deadheads were set up as vendors for our events, food and
coffee/hot chocolate (how nice to have real food to eat, hot coffee in the
morning!) and t-shirts, candles and stuff -- but mostly they didn't mingle into
our group (with a couple of interesting exceptions) --

Then the sun came up, and the mist was rising off of the grass as we were tired
and mellow from dancing and partying all night ... and I look down the dirt road
and here comes a couple probably in their late 40s, dressed in tie-dye and
hippie garb, with their steaming cups of coffee in hand, and their two little
boys running behind them, walking toward the dance area, to sort of check us out
and share our music and vibe for a little while -- And when they got to the
dance area, they just stood to the side and watched us, maybe not being moved by
the music, maybe not feeling part of the group, maybe just being sleepy and not
yet started on their day...

And I realized that we were different and yet the same - sort of like looking at
yourself at another age, through a looking glass -- I felt a real connection
with them in a way, like a feeling of the past passing on to the future -- it
was especially strong for me, because I'm 42 and know that I have one foot in
each side --  

The moral of this story?  I have no idea, I just know I'll never forget that
moment.  Certainly not all Deadheads are old, and certainly not all ravers are
young -- but as a symbol of a generation, one seems to have passed to the next
--

so....     (did you make it this far in this rambling story?)  
peace and love however you can make it,

leslie   : )

        I'm so glad this discussion has opened up the way it has!  Long
before it started, I came to the conclusion, based on six years of going to
Dead shows and one and a half years of raving, that the vibe of PLUR is the
same, it's just the music that's different.  And even though the style of
music differs, the concept of being joined and of celebrating life and love
through dance is the same.  It's incredible!  I feel that if people deny
this just because they don't want to be associated with one "lifestyle" or
the other, they are too uptight, and probably haven't come to fully
understand themselves and how they fit into this whole puzzle.  I hope more
fellow "Raving Deadheads" will share their thoughts on all this, because
the understanding will no doubt lead to a larger, more beautiful community.
We reach!

Dizzy with possibilities,

This relates to the ongoing "radio stations and formats" discussion.  KSJS
(San Jose State University's station) has a program, M-F, 2am-6pm, called
"Daytime Pleasure."  According to the Web site (www.ksjs.org), it plays
industrial, techno, etherial [sp], hardcore, world, ambient, international,
and experimental music.  Might be worth checking out!  KSJS is 90.5FM.

I didn't say there weren't any people.  I should have said that many of 
the people created the music, and many of the people who got into the 
scene were drawn in by the music.

First off, WELCOME and big newbie hugs to you!

Spun also came out with a mix CD right after Garth's in 1993 and it is 
called "If You Turn On".  It is kinda mellow and trippy - not really 
Spun's style if you ask me, but I really like the CD.  You might try 
Ameba on Haight....they may still carry it. I dunno about SJ locations.

What a wonderful moment!  A moral of the story?  Well, perhaps, this moment
pushed you to realize that "the torch has been passed", ie. the sixties are
truly over, but we didn't learn all the stuff we were supposed to, so some of
those same ideals have been passed on to us in an attempt to cultivate
sweetness and light in humanity.

I love these "significant-feeling-moments", they are great reality checks.

warmly,

it is said by some that ravers are the hippies of the '90s .  Ina huge 
way that's true.  we rebel from the society as a whole and go underground 
to find love.

Plus, many of my raver friends , including myself love both the 
underground music and the music from groups like the g-dead and phish < i 
hope I didn't offend anyone by placing them together, but they ARE similar!>
When a show comes to town <or did - by jerry>  I would often recognize 
people from the rave scene!!

I agree that the two groups are VERY similar!! - good compliment - I'd say

hugs

He's not frightening to me at all.  He's a dinosaur.  And to be truthful, I 
hope he's selected to represent the Republican party in '96.

BECAUSE HE'LL NEVER WIN!

Yeah, I'm a Clinton supporter... hehe...

This weekend starts early with several appealing Leap Day parties; 
then Detroit's Derrick May, Stacey Pullen and Juan Atkins roll into town.
Friday's just overloaded though, with big parties all around the greater
Bay Area - so everyone should have something to do.  Saturday, Chrysalis
ought to be good, and they promise it won't be at the Acme warehouse.

Let me say first that I am not a white power supporter by any means.

Now that we have that out of the way, I have to say that it is really
uncool and (ideally) un-american to try to stifle the creation of their
news group or their free speech, regardless of how offensive *you* find it.

And really, who cares if "rec.music.white-power" is approved? If you don't
like what's there, just don't subscribe! There are quite a few news groups
that are out there that I have no interest in, but I am not running around
trying to muster anti-{insert your least favorite news group here}-group
support.

What if there were a more "moral" organization that were opposed to the
rave scene that tried to muster support to crush us from having our
rave-related community online? There are quite a few people in the US that
are definitely anti-rave, and thank god that they have the decency to just
let us "live and let live." I don't want to have to spent all my energy to
defend our right to free speech and collaboration on the Internet. First
"rec.music.white-power" gets attacked, and then who's next? Hyperreal?
"alt.rave"? Get it?

Now let's not get into a "raving is OK vs. rec.music.white-power is not OK"
type argument. That's not the point. At all. The specifics of the topics
are not what my rebuttal is about. It's about free speech, plain and
simple. Nothing more, nothing less.

To which I reply: I see it not so much as a torch passing, or a generation
giving way to a new one, but that the common thread of PLUR is eternal, and
is shared by many diverse subcultures.  It flows through us, age
notwithstanding.  "It surrounds us, penetrates us; it binds the galaxy
together."  (Shameless quote!)  So, let us perpetuate it, and, rather than
pass it on, share it, thus becoming an ever-growing family!

Hugz to all,

I wouldn't be surprised if Dole gets it, though Forbes has LOTS of $$...

'95 to Burning Man '96.

Start building your art cars, hoarding your psychedelics, and getting excited!

I have a grin on my face from just thinking about it!

Whats follows is another advance release from the Spring 96 "Building Burning
Man" newsletter. '96 Registration form included at end'o'file; get a $10
discount if you send it in before June 1st!

*************************************************

SURVIVAL

Visitors to the playa should not come as spectators to a show. Instead, they
will encounter an interactive experience; a spontaneous outpouring of energy
that is created by our community itself. Burning Man is a phenomenon which
springs from your immediate involvement. We are not funded by grants or
product endorsements. We depend upon direct contributions. Hundreds of people
are now engaged in creating this year's event. Here is how you can help:

CONTRIBUTE
Send in your registration fee today!  By purchasing your ticket now for $25
you can save $10. Beginning in June tickets to the event will cost $35. Buy a
t-shirt or a video. If you can, make an extra contribution (see the check box
on order form). Many new projects- Mudhenge, the Inferno, a new public
transit project, and an elaborated Man-are being readied for 1996. None of
this will happen without your early support. If you are among those people
who already know they are coming to Burning Man, help us now.

VOLUNTEER
There is only one way to become a member of the Project.  You must do
something. Burning Man is a society of activists. Later this year we will
solicit volunteers to help us run the infrastructure of our camp. We are now
recruiting experienced builders, people to do data entry and distribute
flyers, help with clerical tasks, and individuals who can assist with
transport of materials to Nevada throughout the year. If you have any skill
or resource which you think might help us in our preparations, please call
our Hotline.

ARTISTS
In addition to the "Inferno," Burning Man is planning many new art
initiatives in 1996.  Our burning pageant in the desert on Sunday, September
1, will feature large-scale portable effigies that can be raised overhead.
 Puppeteers, model makers, stilt walkers, fire performers, etc.-please
contact us.  We also need folks to assist us in casting a large number of
plaster brains (yes, brains ) that will be featured at our premier show on
March 23 at the Minna Street Gallery in San Francisco.

MUDHENGE
In 1995 our camp was inundated by a rainstorm and mudpeople sprang from the
playa (you know who you are). In 1996 we will construct a temple and public
shower in which to house these rites. We invite all persons of mud to
worship, wallow, and bathe between the legs of "Water Woman" (Showers are
restricted to initiates. You must first get down in the mud). If you would
like to help construct and tend the temple, or wish to organize and schedule
an event here (i.e. mud wrestling, a mud procession, etc.) please contact our
Hotline.

PUBLIC TRANSIT
The playa of the Black Rock Desert is a fundamentally safe environment.
 Apart from the very real, dire, and life-threatening hazard of becoming lost
[please read the Survival Guide that is mailed to all registered
participants] the playa is as flat and as forgiving as the mattress of a
playpen. The greatest hazard that we face is self-created. Nearly every one
of the few serious accidents and injuries that we have witnessed during
Burning Man has involved automobiles. This year we encourage everyone to
bring bicycles. They are perfectly adapted to the hard-packed surface of the
playa.  We plan also to organize a pool of specially marked bicycles for
public use. If you can help us with this effort please call our Hotline.

FILM FEST
We are now accepting entries for the 2nd Annual Burning Man Film and Video
Festival. The deadline for submissions is July 4th. Please contact Coffee
Achievers at 415.826-3277. Ask for Hernan.

SETTLEMENT
This year, the city of Black Rock will sport a newly renovated downtown area
and a number of exurban hubs, or "meta-theme camps." If you want to create
your own city within a city, call the Hotline.

*************************************************

I am sorry to announce that the live broadcast has been postponed. It will
still happen, although delayed to a future date. The management truly
apologises for any inconvenience. Further info will be given later.

I would also like to state at this point that because people cannot receive
the numerous radio broadcasts with cool techo/ambient/trance/trip hop/dub/etc
shows should not conclude that radio in the SF bay area sucks, but perhaps
that you live in an area that has bad radio reception.

Sorry to mix these two topics in one message.

Doug

To the list...... there have been several posts in recent weeks about news 
articles that discussed MDMA, but no one seems to have actuallly read the 
articles or can find them.  So after a little DB search, the following are a few
articles, mostly from the British press, that appeared over the past couple of 
months.  This is what is out in the press, correct information or not, its what 
the masses read. just so you know.

HEADLINE: Pathologists uncover agony of ecstasy

BYLINE: By Alan Macdermid;Medical Correspondent;

BODY:
    A GRIM toll of damage to the liver, brain, and heart has been uncovered by
post-mortem examinations of young men who had been taking ecstasy and similar
rave drugs.

    Necrosis - gangrene-like rotting - was found in the liver of all seven of
the men, aged from 20-25, who were examined by forensic pathologists at
Sheffield University.

    Five also had necrosis or other damage to the heart, and four had brain
damage of one sort or another - blood clotting, swelling, and cell death in one,
haemorrhage in two, and severe swelling and bleeding in the fourth, consistent
with water intoxication.  

    Internal bleeding was found in the lungs of two of the men. Damage due to
loss of blood supply was seen in the lungs of a third.

    Reporting the cases in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, Dr Chris Milroy
and his colleagues said traces of ecstasy (MDMA) or other amphetamine
derivatives - Eve (MDEA) or MDA - were found in six of the victims.

    The seventh, a 23-year-old dying from progressive jaundice and liver
failure, had admitted regular ecstasy use.

    Another of the seven had collapsed in a disco, having drunk 14 litres of
water in an attempt to quench the thirst and hyperthermia associated with the
combination of ecstasy and dancing.

    Two also collapsed at a rave or disco, two were found dead or dying in bed,
and one collapsed in the street.

    Hyperthermia was present in only two of the seven cases, and the
pathologists suggest that damage was being caused independently of the effects
of hyperthermia.

    They point out that one of the problems associated with taking ecstasy is
the wide variation in the content of the tablets, some of which may be toxic.
Nevertheless, none of the seven had traces of contaminants in their blood - only
the drugs.

    It is estimated that 500,000 people in the UK take ecstasy every week. The
incidence of death has been described by the drug's defenders as very 
lowcompared with legal drugs such as alcohol or tobacco.

    These examination results indicate that people who regularly take ecstasy
may be risking serious and irreversible damage to their brains, hearts, and
livers.

HEADLINE: Ecstasy users 'risking heart and liver damage'

BYLINE: GLENDA COOPER

BODY:
    GLENDA COOPER

    Long-term users of the drug ecstasy risk rotting their livers and damaging
their hearts and brains, as well as the short-term risk of overheating,
according to a study published today.

    The findings of the team led by Dr Chris Milroy, of the Department of
Forensic Pathology at Sheffield University, emerged from post-mortem
examinations of seven young men who died after taking ecstasy (MDMA) and a
related drug known as Eve (MDEA).

    In Britain, more than 500,000 people are said to use the drug each week.
Many people, including users, are aware of the dangers of overheating caused by
the drug which has led to deaths in the past. But recently the death of Leah
Betts highlighted the lesser known risk of drinking too much water after taking
ecstasy.  

    Seven deaths examined in the Journal of Clinical Pathology were investigated
over the last three years. They were men aged between 20 and 25. Three collapsed
at a rave or a disco, two were found in bed, one collapsed in the street, and
one was admitted to hospital with severe jaundice.

    The results suggest that although overheating - hyperthermia - is one of the
symptoms that can lead to death after taking ecstasy, also known as E, Adam or
XTC, there may be toxic effects on the liver and other organs.

    The researchers found that all the men's livers showed "dramatic changes"
with dead tissue seen in all cases. Similar damage was found in the hearts of
five of the men and swelling, bleeding and damaged nerves were evident in the
brain in three instances.

    One victim had severe swelling of the brain tissue as a result of having
drunk 14 litres of water in an attempt to quench his thirst.

    Internal bleeding was found in the lungs of two of the men and damage
because of loss of blood supply was seen in the lungs of a third. The changes
present in these deaths were the same as those from heatstroke.  But only two of
the men had suffered a sharp rise in body temperature with readings of 39.5C and
44C.    The paper also warns: "Another problem for the recreational drug taker 
is
the quality of tablets they take. Examination of ecstasy tablets . . .  has
shown that the contents of the tablets may vary greatly . . . With such material
the possibility of toxic contaminants being present is evident."

    Dr Milroy concluded: "The short-term risks of ecstasy use are becoming
increasingly more apparent, and questions must be asked about the long-term
effects on the brain, liver and heart, considering the pathology in those who
die."
    In the UK, ecstasy is now categorised as a Class A drug - equivalent to
heroin and cocaine - with penalties of up to seven years' imprisonment for
possession and life for supplying it others.

HEADLINE: "Ecstasy" damages internal organs, researchers say

DATELINE: LONDON

BODY:
   Long-term use of Ecstasy, Europe's second most popular "recreational" drug
after cannabis, can destroy the liver and damage the heart and brain, a study
released Tuesday found.

   The effects were clearly seen in young men in their early 20s, indicating
that the drug quickly causes widespread damage.

   Forensic pathologists at Sheffield University said autopsies of seven young
men who had died after taking Ecstasy found "striking changes" in all their
livers, including large areas of dead tissue. In one case there was "massive"
damage.  

   Their hearts were also damaged, as were the brains of three of them. Internal
bleeding was found in the lungs of two and damage from loss of blood supply in
the lungs of a third.

   Dr. Robert Forrest, who worked on the study, said all the men had levels of
Ecstasy in their blood, which indicated the drug caused the damage. Three of the
men, aged between 20 and 25, collapsed at a "rave" or dance party or at a disco.

   "There's nothing else to cause it," he said in a telephone interview. "You
find the drug levels there, you find the pathological changes and you are faced
with somebody dead, the question is, did the drug cause it?"
   Doctors say the drug has killed at least 60 people in Britain. The case of
Leah Betts, who died after taking one dose of the drug on her 18th birthday,
caused a nationwide outcry about its danger.
   A Council of Europe report last year showed it was the continent's most
popular recreational drug after cannabis.
   Forrest said further study was needed, but urged other doctors to make
careful autopsies of young people who died after taking drugs.
   "The short-term risks of Ecstasy use are becoming increasingly more apparent,
and questions must be asked about the long-term effects on the brain, liver and
heart, considering the pathology in those who die," the researchers wrote in the
Journal of Clinical Pathology.
   The report said the damage to their organs was consistent with overheating-
which does cause some Ecstasy deaths. Users dance for for hours, often either
suffering from dehydration, or drinking lethal amounts of water in an attempt to
avoid it.   But it was also consistent with amphetamine use. "You get exactly 
the same
thing in a cocaine overdose," Forrest said.
   Ecstasy, clinically known as methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, (MDMA), was
first developed as an appetite suppressant. A derivative of amphetamine, it is a
stimulant causing a rush of energy and heightened perception.

>by the way, what do people call you? S seems so ssssssssshort?

So you reeeeaaaaaalllyyyy want to know, huh?  Well... I'll tell you, but 
then I'll be forced to hug you...  I guess I never put out an introduction 
on the list, so here goes...

My name is Todd.  I'm 6'1", 190lbs., fairly athletic, brown short hair, 
short brown goatee, brown eyes.  I'm a Sr. Applications Engr. for DHL 
Airways, Inc., in Redwood City, which is a fancy way of saying I'm a 
programmer that knows what he's doing.  I'm completely serious at work, part 
good-natured, part tie and jacket wearing hard-ass.  Outside of work I'm the 
biggest, goofiest kid you'll ever meet, usually high energy and bouncy.  I 
currently live in Mountain View, been in Cal for 13 years.  I'm from 
Tallahassee FL originally, although I've been all over the place.  I'm a 
romantic, a Southern gentleman at heart and in practice, and the coolest 
uncle in the world, bar none, to my 3 year old nephew Joey and my 10 month 
old niece Katelyn.  I've got one foot solidly in the conservative, 
family-oriented, 9-5 world, and one foot dancing across the line to the 
loose, partying, care-free, liberal, PLUR practicing, chemically assisted 
world.  I'm a 31 year old good ole country boy gone to the big city.  I'm a 
macho guy that actually has a stuffed monkey toy in the back seat of his car 
named "Elvis" for when my nephew is in the car.  I'm a 
foaming-at-the-mouth-anti-racist, screaming-anti-pedophile, non-homophobe, 
open-minded, soft-spoken, butt-kicker-of-bullies, Democrat.  I'm the guy the 
ladies crowd close to when the weirdos are staring, and I'm the guy little 
kids gravitate to with big grins because I'm probably already playing with 
their toys anyway, so I must be alright.  I cook killer Chinese, Japanese, 
French, and Italian food, and now I'm learning Thai.  I include cheesed 
grits when I cook breakfast for guests.  I have a to-die-for-pumpkin pie 
recipe that I've included in the Southern recipe book I've started, "Uncle 
Todd's Cookbook".  I grow my own Thai peppers because nothing is ever hot 
enough, and I cook a homemade chili that will peel the tiles off the Space 
Shuttle.  I bike on a 10-speed I built, I lift weights, I play basketball, I 
love hiking.  I have a love of the ocean.  In fact I think that, if I'd been 
born 100 years ago, I'd have been a sailor just for the adventure.  I'm part 
Irish, English, Scottish, and 1/8 Greek.  I speak some Spanish and Japanese, 
a smidgen of French, and dribs and drabs of Cantonese, Malaysian, and 
Italian.  I'm not big on alcohol, but I drink Guiness when I'm in a pub, 
Tanqeria (sp?) and tonic at formal parties, Tequila when I'm out with the 
guys whuppin' their butts in pool.  I am loyal to a fault and would put 
myself between a bullet and anyone I called friend.  I liked Cuban cigars 
BEFORE it was fashionable.  I draw fairly well.  I have 10 hamsters -- about 
6 too many -- and a deep love of friendly cats and big sweet dogs, although 
my apartment complex doesn't allow them.  I like Rock, Soul, a little 
country -- no twang-de-twang, please -- and I'm rapidly building a 
collection of Techno and House.

I LOVE to dance.  And I DO have rhythm...  ;)

If you're really nice to me, I'll tell you what the SDream came from some time.

>(I agree on the Buchanan issue, he has the least chance to beat Clinton)

Y'know, Clinton has made mistakes -- what president hasn't? -- but he had 
the guts to at least try some things that other politicians promise and rant 
and rave (?!) about but wouldn't actually touch with a 10-foot pole.  And 
he's human.  I mean, I actually like him!  When he was in Russia and Yeltsin 
was cracking him up, I started laughing with him!  That would have been me 
up there, giggling and clapping Yeltsin on the shoulder.  Did you see that?  
It makes you feel good about the direction the world is going, when the 
world leaders can joke and buddy around without the posturing and 
threatening, y'know?

>I'd love to meet you in person sometime when we're out

Likewise!

>Saturday it looks like Wicked is the plan -- I rarely fail to go there, but we
>had a small diversion thinking to go to Chrysalis, but some friends are back on
>the Wicked track

Yeah, it looks like either Chrysalis or a u.g. if we can find a good one.  
I'm hoping we'll at least stop by Chrysalis so I can meet all these sfravers!

Well, all I can say is that if this were a CFV for "rec.music.black-power",
and it were being pushed through by a black-centric group, I would still
feel the same way -- that they have a right to have their home on the net.
And to tell you the truth, I feel that it takes a very strong person so
support THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH of even those you disagree with, even if
they may be your enemies.

I am strong enough to do that.

I wish that everybody were.

Hey all!

Here's an ignorant question, but one that's never been explained to me 
actually.  Where did the term "rave" come from?  Why is it raving?  
Just curious!

Love,
Shawna

It makes me shudder to think what that would mean if he even won the
republican nomination. Still maybe that is what's needed to get people
off their butts and stop taking our election process for granted.

"rave", as a slang term as early as the 60's and perhaps before, 
meant:to stay up all night dancing.

It may not be GOOD, but Wild 107 DOES play quite a bit of house music.
Since it has become a trendy item, I have heard quite a lot of
303-like squealing on that station along with the usual slow jams and
hiphop.  This is where to look for the commercialization of the scene;
it's format is really quite similar to London's Kiss FM.

I too am older -- 41 -- and have been lurking here for a few weeks.

My original intention was just to maybe find out more about techno, 
which I really am just now discovering (thank you KALX) but I've
been sitting here fascinated by these messages. The scene seems
like a high-tech version of the scenes I was in 20 years ago: 
positive, community-oriented, loving... I thought such things were 
passe' as the Hippies became objects of ridicule.  Yeah, peace and 
love, what a stupid fucking idea...

It's also encouraging, because I've been kind of reticent to check
it out for fear of feeling out of place.  Hmm, maybe I'll check it 
out... so if y'all see an Old Fart looking a little bashful by the 
sidelines, give 'im a smile.

A USENET call for votes, is just that -- a call for votes. So I don't
see any problem with the "anti white power" faction ralling against 
the creation of the newsgroup, just like "pro white power" folks will
rally for the creation of the newsgroup. Let the arbitrators get their
numbers and decide. Either that, or you don't agree with the concepts
of democracy and voting. 

The tyranny of the populace can go against the fringe bad as it can go
against the fringe good. You have to accept that or assume some other
kind of system where super-geniuses-in-the-know do all the thinking for
a populace that is too dumb to think for themselves. I like democracy
better. It averages everything, both good and bad.

Pls put this before the P.S one...but like always you probaqlly have delteted
it already. My first post didn't get posted. SOooooo
 
I'm signing off SFRaves because, I'm wasting your time with the delete key,
deleting my post. and also my internet time posting. I've had over the year
less then a hand full post back to me on a general post..and less on personal
post. This is not including people I talk to on a daily basis. Total 3. So
instead of you wasting time deleting my post whether personnal or private,
you don't have to worry, I'm off of here. You can see me at the next party 
if you know me and for those who don't, I wear my laminate. If I see one,
I'll make it a point to saw HI. Other than that. I don't see what reason ther
is for me to stay..No one seems to listen to me any way. I hope you got my
original post...It was much better. but then again you probally deleted it
before you even saw the title, or who wrote it. For those that know me, you
have my email, for those that don't. See ya when I do.

NOTE: Liberty is once again fuzting with their mail system, domain names
...etc so if duplicates appear please just delete them, and send all flames
to sysop@liberty.liberty.com, thanks

BY YOUR COMMAND:

        First, what's going on tonight, Thursday 2/29/96.....oh my it's a
leap year.

        Second, looking for last weeks calendar and this weeks if it's out
yet, so could some kind soul please send it to me.

        Third, I've been down for over a week sleeping with my new system
which at this point is about 85% stable and going up(yes, I'm cohabiting for
all you tech heads in Win 95, with unsupported hardware, & without even a
warning). However, and to my dismay my ISP provider went  down as well, and
the unthinkable happened. They lost a weeks worth of mail, argh!!!!!! So if
you sent me something from Friday 2/23/96, until today, I haven't gotten it
& won't unless you resend.

        Fourth, I'm looking at my Alameda County Sample Ballot for the Green
party, and yes I see Ralph Nader is their parties Candidate for President of
the United States. WE have a chance to place a good honest person in office,
please don't pass this one by. If anyone would like to discuss this with me,
please e-mail me privately, thanks.

        Finally, with my new system I picked up Delrina's CommSuite for
WIN95, by Symantec. It's an integrated Web Browser, Fax Software,
Communications Packages with Full Internet Functionality(eg Mail, IRC, FTP,
Gopher ...etc), all in one package. It seems to work seamlessly, however the
Web Browsers appearance leaves something to be desired compared to Netscape,
which has wonderful appeal visually but lacks functionality. But for intro
price of $100 that I paid for  it at CompUSA it's worth it. You will pay at
least that to register all the other products that are out there and get
something less.

I think she is aware of those good promoters,  and Jen you made your point
very well about the whole trend issue.  It is already trendy.  It is to bad,
but very true.  The movie "Kids"  really portrays how trendy the scene is
getting.

[ to sfraves list ]

 Something that occured to me , inspired by a recent , somewhat bitter post.

 I started going to raves at about 1993. Since then , I've met a lot of
SFRavers , and I'm glad to see them at the events I go to. It's an added
small pleasure every time I see a familiar face , and we recognize each other.

 However - I rarely see rave folks outside of raves. It hadn't occured to
me to wonder why in a serious manner until tonight.

 A couple of factors that might explain this -

 * I'm not a very social person to begin with. Before raves , my socialising
   was limited to girlfriends and just a few others. I'm not an extrovert or
   a "party person" . It takes awhile for me to get into "friendship" mode
   with any individual.
 * By the time I started going to raves , I had already built up a group of
   friends that I still socialise with. I suspect that I'm thinking in a
   subconscious sense that I have just enough friends that I can "handle" . 
   More would add a certain psychic stress .
 * I'm married to someone who likes rave music and likes to go to the 
    occasional event , but , due to health limitations , she can't go to a lot
    of the raves I go to. So , to compensate , I spent more "special time"
    with her instead of raving .
 *  I'm older than most ravers , and a bit of "generation gap" might be 
    preventing the establishing of more friendships with rave folks outside 
    of a rave environment.
 *  Folks don't want me as a friend outside of a rave environment. Of course,
    given the above , I may be giving off a "don't bug me" vibe of some sort...
 *  I live in Sunnyvale , which is about 40 miles south of San Francisco. 
    That prevents me from doing casual "lets go out to dinner now" kind of
    stuff with SF and East Bay ravers. 

 What do you folks think? I also want to say , that I hope I haven't hurt 
anyone's feelings by implying that you folks are "second-class" friends. 
And , this really isn't a call for a lot of sympathetic email giving be ASCII 
hugs 'n such. I'm just asking ....
