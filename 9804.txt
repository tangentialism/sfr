There is no "dip" at zero. Which means a 'pure' fade through zero.

If you have the money I recommend it. Even if you have to do without 
food for a couple monthes.

Hi! My name is Ravin' Rick Bloom. I am 30 years old (look younger) and
have been raving for years. I would like to go to SF this weekend, April
3-5 to party. I have been to SF raves before, also to parties in the
Netherlands (whew!) I have excellent references and have my own money. 
WHat I need is for one of you kind souls out there to volunteer to act as
my host and take me to a rave. I would not go to SF alone. I want to make
friends and would like to be among people who know the scene. Sorry for
asking this last minute but my boss just left the office for the week and
I can get plane tickets and so if I am going to do this- this is the
weekend. I really am a fun, safe guy. Email me or leave me your phone
number and I will call you on my dime. I have my own money( I am a
commercial realtor) and am not asking for a free ride. Let's have fun!
You have never danced  at a rave till you have danced with me!!
Ravin' Rick Bloom

couples and they share rooms, and they are not that big.  So anyone 
seriously interested and are couples or are into sharing rooms, come by 
and check it out...........the rent would be 300 each with five people 
including me, and the move in would be $900 a piece which is 1/5 deposit 
and first month rent............

Hello, everyone.  I'm new to the list and all, but I've been raving almost
a year now in
sf and oakland.  It's changed my life and when the subject came up about
making a documentary
for my film class at UCB, guess what I chose to make my film about?

So, now, I am asking for your help.  Please tell me what raving means to
you.  Feel free
to talk about anything about raving that matters: what you think people
outside the scene think, i.e. misconceptions or prejudices, etc. and just
whatever you've noticed about raving that you want to go off on.  I'm
especially interested in the organization of the production crews and
massives, and economics and race issues: who goes to what parties, how much
money's involved not only in promoting and attending parties, but how much
people spend for raves: tickets, clothes, accessories, recreational
others.....;)

Also, if you do respond (and I REALLY hope you do!) please tell me if it's
ok to quote you in my film.  If you don't mine my including your thoughts
and ideas, then please tell me if you'd like to be anonymous, or give me
whatever name you'd like to be identified by.

Let me say this: I am not out to slander the scene or the people in it. I
just want to show anything and everything that happens at parties.

Thanks for duking it out through this LONG message and I hope to hear from
you.

much love
& besitos!   marie

I wasn't in the mood for static last night.

I mean really not in the mood.  8 hours on my feet
working the machines at kinko's did not leave me much
energy to dance.  I was tempted to go sleep, but I
saw my roomate headed down the street, so I told
myself to not talk myself out of going.

I'm glad I did- it was one of those nights where
dancing was extremely theraputic for me.  It was one
of the nights where I could block out all the people
around me and left the music wash over me and I can
go into some kind of hyper tai chi state.  Which is
not always a good thing at static because usually the
press of bodies in that small space is sensual but
when you go into hyper mode it can get dangerous>
apologies to all whose eyes I nearly poked out.;)

I am hoping to repeat my therapy tonight.  Is anyone
going to the release of net5 party, or the sabotage
crew with t1000 gig or the crash worship show?  My
roomate wants to do it all.  I'll either reach a new
level of consciousness or die...

pjf
ps I thought the crash worship show was girls
only(anyone know?)

HMMMMMM raving.......Ok here is my 2 bits.....I have only been raving for 6
months.....its completely changed my views of everything. Before I was going
to parties, I was happy but I still felt confined...like I had to fit into the
description and do the things that people thought were normal. I went to my
first party and my jaw was dropped open when I got there. I was like WOW! I
didnt understand it all, but it was beautiful. It made me smile ear to ear. I
have not stopped smiling since. To me,raving means so many things....freedom,
expression, the choice to feel and be how you want to , and not to give damn
about what others think. I love it, I hope I am doing it untill my legs are
toasted, then I'll go on a wheel chair!
Raving is also the joy of the music...as I love the sound of the bass. I love
to feel it when I push my body up against the bass speaker and  it gives me a
gentle massage...
I just have never been able to find a description of raving that can do any
justice.
Harmony, the feeling ,not the party crew, is one word that I can think of.
Inner joy, a child like view of things, a release.......See, this all doesnt
describe how I feel ...its very hard tput it all in words but I hope that
helped. 
Ok, views from other people.....seeing as how thats still in my memory bank
only being 6 months ago......my views before I started raving.....I was like
the majority of people....images of extacy and black lights went floating in
my head....thats all I knew of it. Even the kind of music that is heard at a
party ....I was thinking it was like the techno they play on wild 107 or
something! So a good friend of mine invited me to my first one. My view of it
when I first got there was it looked fun but completely insane....I loved it,
but didnt know how to put it all together.....it was crazy!  But other people
who have not been fortunate enough to go to one...well, I have heard them
called ex parties by people who have never been to one. I have heard the words
not of their mouths, but the words of a 20/20 special being vocalized through
the mouths of the uneducated people who say "they know" because they saw some
tv show by people who dont even fucking rave!  I know people who are
curious.....they want to know what its all about....I love that! I try to get
those people to come with me. I also have heard of people who have never been
to one that honestly have no clue .....they are like " a rave, whats that?" 

My folks......they are real supportive. of course I am 21, and they dont
control what I do. They said if I was in highschool they would have never
aloowed it.....and then they started talking about a well klnown info show
that  did a story on raves.....I did my best to tell them, its not about all
drugs....a lot of people party sober....its about choice...but like many
others they said " but I read this article, I saw that show"  funny things is,
more people have dies and gotten hurt leaving frat parties than raves....and
yet no one freaks when their kid goes to a footbal after party or a "keger"
so I think peoples views are mixed....wich I guess is better than being one
sided in the negative spectrum of it all......

Tix- I usually pay around 10-15 bucks for a ticket....but I have seen them as
low as 3 bucks, and as high as 25 bucks. I wont pay 25 bucks any more though!
As far as party crews, I have never helped with a party so I dont know the
exacts of what goes on. I can tell you this. People put a lot of love,
effort,energy and hard hard work and dedication to make these things
happen....everyone I know who goes to help with a party gets there in the
middle of the day and doesnt leave until like 8am or later the next
morning.....major props! 
Clothes-I buy almost everything at thrift stores! I can go in with 50
bucks,walk out with at least 5 pairs of pants, and some shirts to boot!
Sometimes I go to head shops to buy shirts...they are like 20-25 bucks there
so I dont do it a lot. 
I hope all this has helped. I hope you are doing this with love and honesty to
the scene and if you are, best of luck to you!

Subject: Denver RAVES! Activated #9 - Kenya
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Gang,

I just got back from Denver last night (on business) but was able to sneak
away for awhile to see what was going on in the land o' mile high stadium.
I found this cool rekkid shop called synaptic records on one of the main
strips (Broadway, go figure...).
Picked up a couple of CD's from Submerge (Detroit Techno - which I was
pleasantly surprised to see DJ-T1000 making an appearance here :) and
picked up a few flyers. The city seemed pretty dead, but I really didn't
have enough time to explore fully like I usually do.
To my point: I found this mag called Activated, a free zine outta
Baltimore. Reading the masthead it looks like it is distributed at
Housewares in the city. Anyway, I like reading reviews of music, and there
is this reviewer called Kenya that cracks me up. Let me write verbatim a
coupla of his reviews:

"Double 99 Rip Groove (Logic Records)

SPEED GARAGE. It's here, Logic is selling. Pushing it on kids, cause
really, it's the next big thing. I was late on the speed garage thing. I
didn't catch it until i heard Feelgood at "Think". For all i feel, you can
keep it. It all sounded like Sugar Daddy remixes and spin offs. This record
is the same; it's okay for a house record but it just gets real tired real
quick. House pattern and supposed "jungle basslines". I didn't know jungle
had a certain bassline; I've heard thousands of them, but hey speed garage
has it. I swear to god it all sounds like Sugar Daddy. Spin it if ya want.
Rock on."

Fatboyslim The BeatBurger EP (Astralwerks)

"I always knew that a) the Chemical Brothers would in time influence a lot
of people and that b) they would create many Chemical Brothers spawns. This
EP sucks. When I got all these promos, weeks and weeks ago, i went to
Flavor to drop them inna mix and just to see how people hangin out reacted.
I swear to god people wouldn't stop laughing until i did a nasty rewind and
yanked it off the table. This stuff is like pop rock meets candy raver
meets DJ Dan meets the Chemical Brothers, (with) over burdened hiphop
stolen beats with metal guitar riffs or cheesy samples and old stolen piano
lines from people more talented. Sadly though in some places i bet this
shit leaps off the 1200s and into the crowd at a rave they eat it up. Go
Ravers. Rave on."

or....

Toxic 220 Subliminal Sewage (Sugar Spliff, US)

" Toxic 220 is part of the infamous Spiral Tribe. So delighted iwas to hear
this. It's jungle, it's Sprial Tribe .. it's gonna be good. After all the
Shite i have been reviewing this was it. WRONG. PLEASE COME AGAIN. THANK
YOU. This is shit. Everyone is saying jump up is shit. No way. THis is
shit. Darkside rocks, i have just discovered my darkside/techstep other
half as a DJ. But with any form of music, too much is a bad thing. Two
tracks, both dark. I like them both but then the programming just gets
silly. Both tracks sound like they have 5 different rhythm pattterns...nice
listening, but it doesn't communicate well on the dancefloor and either way
it gives me a migrane."


THis is funny stuff considering most of the review you read these days are
filled with non-meaningful words like "the sound is deep. This track is
smooth." etc. Usually I'm a stickler for grammer, but this sounds like any
conversation at a DJ store that could be had.

They have a web site:
http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/studio/9391/active.htm

didn't test the link, however. maybe it works?

Anyway, props to this mag for printing the stuff raw w/o regard to status quo.

later!

Static just goes from strength to strength. Last night completely rekindled my passion for small techno nights, the music was from another dimension, the crowd were so diverse and up for it, not a cheesy quaver or glowstick in sight. 
Who the hell was the DJ on from 11-12.30 who did a Mills at the end of his set by dropping Strings of Life? Wikked, brought many smiles and cheers.
Then I think it was Brad who went on with more killer techno - everyone completely going ballistic on the dancefloor. Tunes were beautiful hard mindfunk trippy techno, just as I love it. It just got more and more insane and in the last half hour switched to techstep jungle - yus! The mood of the night was summed up by this guy arriving alone at 1AM dressed in a pinstripe suit and tie, looking completely cleancut and slightly out of place. 5 minutes later I turn around, and right next to me this guy is going off on one, dancing like a demented lunatic, screaming an pumping his fist in the air, still with his suit jacket done up. Welcome to the club!
Bodes well for Sabotage at El Pirata tonight - be there or be an orange. I'll be in my "Fuck goa trance" t-shirt again. Say hello, I'll be the one dancing like a loon.

A bit late, I know, but I had to say it: the jungle being spun before the 
reprazent crew went on (dj suv spinning?) was the most amazing I've ever 
heard. Not to mention, roni size & co. gave the most entertaining live 
musical performance I've ever seen, of any genre. 

The show was so much _fun_, I couldn't believe it. Wish you all could have 
made it (and props to those that did: science, lara, meganhug and 
others). Did anyone record it?

No dip at zero???!!!!!  That would be so nice.  Sometimes I'm never
hanging out in the green but other times it seems like all my records end
up there.   What is the price on one of those?

well here it goes......
 Raving to me is a big part of my soul and heart....
        a person the other day asked me what i was like before i was
raving....and the truth is that i was the happy open minded kid that i am
now....raving hasn't changed my views....i realized that people should be who
they wanted and not worry about what everyone else thought before i started
raving... when i realized that most and i do underline most......ravers were
open minded and open hearted and loving and willing to share that love no
matter what kind of clothes you wore or what color skin......and you and i
were all excepted as who we were deep down inside.. i knew that i had found my
nich.....the place that i was looking for to have fun....and listen to
music....and dance....and meet new and wonderful people... and to talk about
feelings....and opinions.... ands not worried about being excepted.... now see
i am thankful to have found this at a young age because raving is beautiful
and intense and some people my age aren't ready to bring in that kind of
intesnse beauty.....and there are some people no matter what age that aren't
ready but that is also my opinion but i am not here to judge...i am here to be
free of the mad drama of not being the right person wearing the right cothes
or whatever.....society sucks....and no matter if you are raving or not you
will always have to deal with some sort of drama.....there is just more
exceptance in raving (but there still is drama sometimes) so yeah...keep on
dancing and keep it real-- p.l.u.r.m  peace love unity respect music.....
without the music we wouldn't be there...love  MoOnBaBy--Jenn

disposable camera, then mumbled something @ his website comrade.com, which
when I checked this morning was populated by busts of Lenin's head.  Very

Be afraid.
Be very afraid.
The Teletubbies are about to migrate from the UK to a screen near you.
Next week PBS (channel 9) starts showing the Teletubbies.
Set your VCRs now.
This is the most essential raver TV program ever.
Made by and for the e-generation.
You have been warned...
If only I had a TV.

That was a dj by the name of Stencil, a UC Berkeley student who is not
actually old enough to come into the club (but don't tell anyone :).  As
far as I know, that was his first time really playing in front of people.
He certainly rocked the house!

Hope to see some of you peeps out at Sabotage tonight for T-1000!

oh my god, portishead was so completely ON last night i still have the 
echos rolling through my body...


the show started with a dj spinning some nice records, i should have 
noticed something was up because he would switch records every 20 
seconds or so.  he started playing some portishead stuff, different 
instrumental mixes of some older tracks.  

then some other people come out and he just starts *going off*...
man o man, i've never seen anybody with the skills like this guy, he
had two of just about every record and would work it so he could just pick
a loop and loop it over and over, faster, slower, his hands were dancing...


eventually the whole band is out there, a guitar, bass, another turntablist,
keyboardist, and of course, Beth.  her voice is even better live, so full
of emotion and experience i was just blown away.  

a few times they would be cruising along through a song and all of a sudden
it would break and be really loud full on groove and then mellow back out.


i can't recall which songs they did, but i liked them all :)  the encores
were sweet.


if you are even considering going tonight (and can find a ticket) GO!!!


that is all,
 justin

A marxist in a pinstripe?
Be very wary.
Why do marxists only drink LadyLee supercheap tea?
Cos proper tea is theft.
Boom boom.
And did you meet that Nico guy from LA with the camcorder and flashlight? Mad nutter. And the rasta guy who was doing crazy MCing to the camcorder mike?

Now all we need to do is convince the barstaff to start serving Red Bull and Vodka and convince Seth that I should spin there and it'd be perfect.

Soo .. .since I'm not worried and my house hasn't been bombed yet, all I can
say is this series of threats in Fremont is really getting on my nerves.
First off, some person/persons set off a few bombs and leave others around in
strategic places, then since they have the whole town paraniod they can mess
with our heads as much as they want.
 And let me tell you!! Having my whole school evacuated today in the FREEZING
CoLD for three hours was NOT FUN!!! there was not a single bomb on campus!!!!!
picture 2,000 freezing students with news helecopters flying overhead and
federal/ATB people all over.  Needless to say we got sick of it and 50 of us
made a mad dash for the road.   Caught a bus home and here I am.... 
WHat A Horrible April Fool's JOKE!!!!!

Well at least the bomber doesnt seem to be trying to hurt people,
only scare them...

i just saw on the news they arrested two kids in idaho for attempting
to blow up up the internet today....one of them even confessed
to also trying to blow up the web.

Anyway i hope they find him soon and that you feel better.

I'm in the midst of organizing another "Day of Noise" event
on KZSU (the Stanford radio station, 90.1 FM).  This time
around it's going to be all day Thursday, from midnight to
midnight.  

This year a number of the performers are into things in the
ambient/techno direction.  Robert Rich is going to kick
things off at Midnight on Wednesday night (yes, that's
TONIGHT), followed by "superdave" (think post-jungle) at
around 2am.  On Thursday night at 7pm, Matmos is going to do
a 45 minute set, and Weird Blinking Lights is going to close
down the event (with a bang?) with an hour long set starting
at 11pm.

There's actually a bunch of things going on I might
recommended to the open-minded (open-eared?) raver, like
Philp Gelb doing a half-hour of solo-shakihaci (japanese
flute) at 4:30pm, maybe Totemplow's guitar drone at 1pm, and
so on.   The full schedule is posted here if you're into it:

   http://kzsu.stanford.edu/~doom/noise4all.html

And if you're one of the folks living outside of KZSU range,
you might want to listen in on real audio:

I got a call from Martin O Brien last night. Those of you who dont know,
Martin is the person who is responsible for The Gathering, Basics, Vision and
Freedom. Anyhow, he was really excited because he had just got home from an
interview he did with Ed Bradley for 60 Minutes. 

It's kind of bizzare, but they're doing a story on raves. I've been told
though that part of the story involves something else. Apparently, they have
unearthed information that glitter may be carniogenic. The whole piece is
about 10 minutes long, and Martin and footage from his parties is used. They
also talk to other promoters and this girl who now has Hodgkins Disease(a
relatively mild and curable form of cancer mainly found in men in their late
20 and early 30's); apparently resulting from using glitter quite a bit. She
lives in Vancouver. In talking with Martin about it, we havent been able to
figure out why they felt the two stories are linked, but he says his part of
the interview went well from his end.

I don't know about everyone on this list, but I'll be watching 60 minutes this
Sunday night for sure.

A really easy mod to do to a existing 1200 by the way...

Costs all of one two pole switch, a couple dabs of solder, and some wire.

Write me if you seriously want to do it, but it's pretty self explanatory
with a little background in electronics and a good look at the soft pink
underbelly of a 1200 (if it's not, consider having someone else do the
mod...).  The physical "detent" stays there (although I'm sure there's a
way to take that thing out too, might require installing another fader
though, and I wouldn't want that... the stock technics ones are pretty
bulletproof... or perhaps they have it as a spare for the mk3?), but it's
very small... smaller than the zone within which the light and "locked
zero" activiates. 

Anyways, I think there's a beauty to "bumping" the other record pitch
slider up or down a little to get both of them out of the green.  A bump
of maybe .25 of a percent on the other decks will take it out of the
"green 0" zone. 

A properly calibrated 1200 only loses maybe 1/8 (.00125 rpm) of a percent
precision to either side of the "green light dip", it really isn't all
that big a deal... not worth the cost of new decks if you already own a
pair.

Finally... how many parties do you get booked at where you get to bring
your own decks... mk3 owner or not, you'll probably end up spinning on the
same old same old mk2's, so you might as well get used to it (and if you
want to ride the future, get on with CDs...). 

If anybody has info on the "backwards" mods that I've heard some guy out
of the UK does, let me know (a switch on the decks which "turns the motor
around" and causes the tt controls to work exactly the same as normal, but
while turning backwards).

-->Ohmygawd I want one of those stuffed teletubbie characters, they are
soooo adohwobble!  I haven't seen the show, but I heard it was like Mr.
Roger's neighborhood in slo-mo...for the really really slow learners out
there. Maybe it will all make sense after you drop a pill or something.
Isn't there supposed to be a "crossdresser" teletubie who is "masculine"
but carries a handbag around? 
	I want one of those damn teletubbie toys bad, oh so really really
really bad; I think the red one.  Time for me to flex my European

        Anyone else going to Crash Worship tonight at the Maritime?  Never
having seen them before I can't really give a strong recommendation, other
than to say that there are very few live bands I'm interested in seeing
(like maybe one or two a year) and this is one of them.

        I don't believe they play electronic music, but from what I've
heard their shows can be pretty interesting.  Very tribal and primal, with
fire & stuff... I'm sure someone else can elaborate on this.  8)

        If you're planning on attending, look for me, I'll be wearing a
white jumpsuit and SFR laminates.  Always fun to meet more SFRavers!

May the bass be with us,

hi, my name is messiah wannabe, and i've been raving for 9 years (hi
messiah!).

i started raving back in the mountains of north carolina.  i was going
to school in a small college town, and there wasn't much to do, so my
friends and i were used to making our own fun.  my buddy craig was
from orlando, florida, one of the first places in the u.s. where
raving caught on, so we decided to throw one ourselves.  it was in a
ski cabin outside of town, about 50 people showed up, and we all had
the time of our lives.  so we kept throwing these little parties...

eventually i started going to raves that other people threw.  there
were a lot of things i really liked about raves.  the crowd was always
pretty mixed up, blacks and whites, straights and gays, grungers,
clubbers, goths, everyone was pretty much welcome.  and the music was
cool, no singers to steal the spotlight, leaving room to focus on your
own thoughts and feelings, rather than someone else's.  plus it was
constantly changing, styles and genres came and went so quickly, it
was hard to get bored with it.  also, raves had a very sexy vibe, not
like some pick-up bar, but everybody was kissing everybody else, and
giving backrubs, and wearing sexy (but comfortable) outfits. 
basically, it was like "sex (and sensuality) is good" which was a
welcome attitude after the uptight, anti-sex 80's.  but there was one
thing about raves that really got me hooked: dancing!  growing up a
middle-class white kid in suburbia, i had really never danced before. 
oh, the occasional slam dance at a punk show, which was fun too, but i
had never seriously moved my body to the rhythm of the music for hours
on end.  what a feeling!  and it didn't really matter that i wasn't
graceful or smooth, no one else was either, we all looked kinda silly.
 but that was ok, raves were very accepting environments, it was hard
to do something that was frowned upon.  and the high you got after
dancing non-stop all night, wow.  drugs or no drugs, it really didn't
matter, that great rush of endomorphins or whatever always made me
feel great for weeks!  the experience, at times, was extremely
powerful.  i felt like i was experiencing god, or at least some sort
of spiritual force, first hand, something i had never really believed
in before...

i've had friends that got really wrapped up in the scene, djing at big
parties, promoting, buying and selling massive amounts of drugs.  a
lot of those people eventually got very disillusioned with it all, and
dropped out of the scene, never to return.  but i never really took it
for more than it was:  a great party, an open, accepting atmosphere to
have fun, often with people who weren't just like me, a place to dance
all night.  now, 9 years later, i still find that there's a place in
my life for all those things.  if anything, as i've grown older, and
my life more complicated and stressful, i find i appreciate them now
more than ever...

:remembering you standing quiet in the rain
as i ran to your heart to be near
and we kissed as the sky fell in
holding you close
how i always held close in your fear
remembring you
running soft through the night --
you were bigger and brighter, and wider than snow
and screamed all the make-believe 
screamed at the sky
and you finally found all your courage to
let it all go

	-- the cure "pictures of you" (my FAVORITE!!! band!!!)

"now that i know that i'm breaking to pieces i'll pull out my heart and
i'll feed it to anyone -- the cure again "disintegration"

"live if you want to live
rastaman vibration, yeah!
positive
i and i vibration yeah!"
	-- bob marley :)!!!!

another from him which seems to fit:

"man to man is so unjust
you dont know who to trrust
your worse enemy could be your best friend
and your best friend, your worse enemy

To everyone who has responded and anyone who may yet respond (hopefully!)

THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!! You have been wonderfully thoughtful and eloquent
and I'm glad no one is blowing this off because it means so much to me.  
I'm tempted to make a version for myself and scale it down into another
version for class...

To clarify: Your responses over the list, if I use them, will be quoted 
in a voice-over narrative, either by myself or most likely a friend I'll
enlist to speak cause I don't really want to be in it myself. I doubt that
I'll run them as subtitles or in title cards between shots because it's too
hi-tech, expensive, and I think kinda boring to read text in a film if you
don't have to.

If anyone is interested and would like to speak on film, I'll be at Feel Good 
Friday (10th) for sure.  I'm working on getting permission to film at The
Gathering on the 11th and the big F-8 party also the 11th.  Just look for a 
short Asian chick with a videocamera!  Also, if you like, contact me and maybe
we can arrange for interviews in person outside of these parties.

And thanks to everyone for your helpful tips on the archives and other 
documentary projects....you've been so supportive so far.  THANK YOU THANK YOU
THANK YOU for your interest and help.  You have put a HUGE smile on my face!

much love
& besitos!
marie

His name is Tinky Winky and he likes his "bag"

IF you are looking for a doll, I bought mine at Toys R US in England, so I
am sure that when they come out over here, there will be *plenty* to go

Ok, so I wasnt going to party this weekend, but it looks like I will be. =)
So, whats this BIONIC party? is it a massive? What kind of music and vibe is
going to be in da house? Whats Ninja tune going to be like also?  I hear
Liquid dreams might be cool and plury, but it requires a trip alllll the way
to f-8. For us SanJose peeps, thats a long way down to go for a pre sale
only....some info would be killer. Later folks!

Hate to admit this, but I have the first 4 episodes of the Teletubbies
on tape.  My brother lives in London and he was too cheap to buy a
REAL Christmas gift.
 
I dare anyone to say Tinky Winky (he's the one with the handbag!) and
keep their thoughts pure.

Portishead was an enjoyable concert. Damn we were high up in the 
balcony, nosebleed seats 4 sure.  We hiked up to our seats, booted the 
klownz squatting in them, and proceeded to settle and sink lower and 
lower-- it was so mellow!  Now I'm not a huge Portishead fan, but I 
enjoy the stuff.  I like it because it's sort of a crossover between a 
rock band (guitar bass singer and all) plus funky beatz and the DJ.  A 
good transitional band to play to your friends who mebbe come from Live 
105 experience and you're trying to turn them on to electronic stuff

Anyhoo has anyone ever seen what she looks like?  I talked to a few 
pee-opals and no 1 had ever seen her actual face.  She was in shadows 
the whole time.  

Did I mention how mellow it was?  People sat placidly in their seats, I 
suppose captivated by her/them (peeps definitely WERE into it).  But 
even the floor below just stood there, an occasional 
head-bobb-to-the-beat.  

Did I mention it was mellow?

i won't give up on love
if we could do it again
we'd do just the same, baby

no matter how small
one smile is all i need
to satisfy me
let's do it again...

we'll tell all our friends, baby

libraries burn down to the ground
but love remains standing tall
although history is a matter of opinion
technology only goes in one direction
the planet shrinks by speed of communication
resources
are being exhausted

so many crises, so many needs

disposable? no
we pust to recycle

nothing compares to you...

 I knew that those things would start to become popular with ravers as
soon as they were discovered;) It's fuuny there are a very large group
of parents that are trying to do away with the Teletubbies. They say that
with the t.v. in their bellies; they look evil...and that 1 year-olds
don't need their own show...c'mon *all* ages watch t.v......

Hey,

A friend sent me this so I thought I'd send it along to you guys:

A Persistent Thumping
                  How Techno Music Has Outlived Its Obituaries

                  By Matthew Collin
                  Special to The Washington Post
                  Sunday, March 29, 1998; Page G01

                  Tough times for electronica. Barely a year ago,
electronic dance music in all its
                  many forms was being hailed by critics,
music-television programmers and
                  industry pundits alike as a phenomenon gathering
commercial force. But by the
                  end of 1997, the hype was in free fall.

                  "For the next big musical movement, electronica has
its work cut out," noted a
                  Washington Post critic. Another newspaper observed:
"As far as the masses
                  were concerned, electronica's major attack was as
easily squashed as house
                  spiders after a heavy rain."

                  The honeymoon had turned sour because -- with two
exceptions, the Prodigy
                  and the Chemical Brothers -- European musicians on the
crest of what had
                  been packaged as pop's new wave failed to make the top
200 best-selling
                  albums of 1997. Perhaps, the pundits mused, America
wasn't ready for a
                  techno revolution right now -- if ever. And then they
congratulated their
                  compatriots for not being bamboozled by the sales guff
exhaled by the record
                  industry.

                  But what got missed when the crits were tossing around
the obits was an
                  understanding of the dynamics of pop culture. Major
labels pick up a catchy
                  marketing phrase, run some ads, call in the pluggers,
get the sales forces
                  pumped, and you have yourself an instant "phenomenon."
Well, it just doesn't
                  work like that. Not for long, anyhow. A genuine pop
movement is never imposed
                  from above; it bubbles up on a groundswell of popular
belief, driven by the
                  passion and commitment of fanatics who create their
own sense of community.
                  Businessmen can sell product, but community can't be
manufactured.

                  "I think the expectations surrounding the genre were
unrealistically high," says
                  Billboard dance music editor Larry Flick. "The
industry was looking for a sales
                  savior and the instant buzz around electronica
triggered a lot of hope. Things
                  were definitely blown way out of proportion. Sometimes
major labels can kill
                  the golden goose long before it's actually laid that
golden egg. There were too
                  many questionable records released at once. The
bandwagon almost
                  collapsed from so many people climbing aboard."

                  Darren Ressler, editor of New York-based national
dance monthly Mixmag, is
                  cautious too, mainly because he's seen it all before.
Back in 1992, when the rave
                  scene with its techno soundtrack first took off in the
States, it proved to be a
                  false dawn, at least in commercial terms. "In 1992, I
saw the dance
                  departments at major labels go wild. The word 'techno'
was suddenly on
                  everyone's lips, and after releasing tons of mostly
horrible compilations,
                  everything went underground again," Ressler says.
"Still, the upside was that
                  the seeds of the culture were planted."

                  Not that anyone within "the culture" really liked the
word electronica anyway.
                  Most found it crass, even offensive; they were only
too aware that it was a
                  catch-all tag foisted on them for economic
convenience: a pidgin translation of
                  a much subtler tongue. The differing (and often, for
outsiders, confusingly
                  complex) sensibilities of techno, house, garage,
ambient, trip-hop, big beat
                  and drum 'n' bass were forced into an uneasy alliance
that pleased no one. "
                  'Electronica' was a marketing term invented by the
music industry to box up
                  everything from [techno trio] Underworld to [drum 'n'
bass hero] Goldie in one
                  neat little package, removing the music from its
subcultural origins and placing
                  it alongside Hanson, Mariah and Puffy," says Tamara
Palmer, editor of the
                  West Coast music monthly URB. "From this perspective,
electronica is a failure."

                  Liam Howlett of the Prodigy became incensed when the
phrase was mentioned
                  to him during the band's U.S. tour last summer: "I
hate this whole electronica
                  thing!" he raged. "It's so difficult trying to make
Americans understand -- I get
                  really frustrated sometimes doing interviews with them
and they go on about
                  this electronica thing and it really annoys me. I have
to say, 'Electronica is
                  [expletive]!' or 'Electronica, what the [expletive's]
that?' The whole thing is just so
                  hyped, it's crap."

                  There is a more serious point here, even if Howlett
couldn't quite articulate it.
                  The black musicians from Detroit and Chicago who
invented techno and house
                  in the mid-'80s always gave as many props to George
Clinton and James
                  Brown as German electronic innovators Kraftwerk. The
coining of "electronica"
                  represented a covert attempt to excise the funk
element from dance music and
                  ignore its origins in inner-city black and gay
subcults, to make it safe for the
                  affluent white consumer. Black music repackaged by
white entrepreneurs is the
                  shadow history of postwar pop, and sure enough, in the
flurry of enthusiasm
                  surrounding electronica, we heard little about Derrick
May, Juan Atkins, Larry
                  Heard, Jeff Mills or Mike Banks, the black auteurs who
breathed life into the
                  machines. While the predominantly Caucasian newcomers
basked in glory,
                  none of the originators was rewarded with a
substantive record deal. Each one
                  was more celebrated in London, Berlin, Madrid and
Paris, where they are
                  regarded as visionary heroes, than in their home
country.

                  The Birth Process

                  Let's rewind the tape and check back on some history,
see how this techno thing
                  really operates. Here's the archetypal tale: Couple of
young guys pick up some
                  cheap equipment in a secondhand store, a few obsolete
drum computers long
                  forgotten by their Japanese manufacturers. They hook
up the boxes in their
                  basement, make a tape. Cut it to 12-inch vinyl in a
run of 1,000: white label,
                  plain bag, title scribbled in Magic Marker. Sell it
direct to specialist dance
                  stores: no middleman, no record deal, no rehearsal, no
gigs, no ad campaign.
                  The only promotion is a few copies passed to club
deejays, the only media
                  coverage appears in some obscure local 'zine. The
stores pay them on
                  sale-or-return basis, and they reap a little cash to
fund the next release.

                  This is the mother lode, this is what every technohead
will tell you it's all about:
                  do-it-yourself music, an entrepreneurial movement
based on personal
                  involvement. Inclusive; open-access. Get up, get into
it, get involved.

                  Techno's democratization of the creative process links
it back to two other, more
                  longstanding DIY pop movements: hip-hop (assembled
from rudimentary
                  equipment: two turntables and a microphone) and punk
rock (a couple of
                  guitars plus three chords). It took a couple of
decades for hip-hop to rise from its
                  origins in block parties in the Bronx to its current
mainstream dominance. With
                  punk rock, the similarities are even more striking and
constitute a handy
                  deconstruction of the pop process.

                  On its release in 1977, a seminal punk album, the Sex
Pistols' "Never Mind the
                  Bollocks," topped the charts in the band's home
country, but only reached 106 in
                  the United States. When the Sex Pistols arrived in the
States in 1978, they were
                  hyped as the latest Brit invasion, come to save the
U.S. pop market as disco
                  threw its last satin-swathed shapes under the
"Saturday Night Fever" mirror
                  ball. At least that's what Warner Bros., the Pistols'
label, wanted people to
                  believe. Of course it never happened: The pimply
freaks with the peculiar
                  hairdos might as well have been aliens for all the
American public cared. But in
                  L.A., in Austin, Seattle and Washington, D.C.,
disaffected bohemians picked up
                  on the Pistols' do-it-yourself anarchist slogans and
took them seriously enough
                  to start their own bands, their own 'zines, their own
record labels. And this
                  industrious, low-tech punk network was the
entrepreneurial motor that
                  ultimately drove Nirvana up from the underground to
bestride the country with
                  "Nevermind" in 1991.

                  By the time of their 1996 comeback jaunt -- an overtly
cynical venture titled the
                  Filthy Lucre Tour -- things had changed. "Bollocks"
had been acclaimed as one
                  of the all-time rock classics by Rolling Stone
magazine, and the Pistols legacy
                  had inspired a whole generation of American bands from
R.E.M. through
                  Nirvana to Green Day.

                  If punk took over a decade to filter through, what
stage is techno at now? "In
                  terms of the nationwide acceptance, popularity or
integration of electronic
                  music into daily life that I see happening in England,
America is not yet on the
                  same page," suggests URB's Tamara Palmer.

                  Nevertheless, she says, "techno is definitely a
cottage industry in the U.S.,
                  serving as the inspiration for everything from
independent clothing lines to
                  record labels. It is a rapidly expanding system.
Nearly every region in the
                  country is informed by a local 'zine of some sort,
from Massive in the Midwest
                  and Synergy in the Southeast to Resonance in the
Pacific Northwest."

                  Techno undoubtedly has an image problem, being based
on participation
                  rather than performance, on the nocturnal community of
the nightclub rather
                  than the charisma of the performer, but although that
constitutes a drawback
                  in commercial terms, it is also its strength and its
appeal. And there are signs
                  that a section of the public may already be getting it
by proxy, assimilating
                  electronica through audio osmosis. Electronic
techniques underpin the new
                  albums by Madonna and Garbage, indicating that
America, if not ready for
                  techno's "Full Monty," is beginning to tune in.

                  Garbage includes in its ranks Butch Vig, producer of
Nirvana's "Nevermind" and
                  a man with a keen sense of which way the wind blows.
The band's "Version
                  2.0" album "pushes the electronic angle pretty hard,"
says guitarist Steve
                  Marker. "There's some aggressive, chattery techno
electronic stuff."

                  Madonna is a notoriously canny player who emerged from
the same gay dance
                  subcult as house music, and for her new album, "Ray of
Light," she employed
                  esteemed producer William Orbit to supply some techno
ambiance. "People
                  think of techno and drum 'n' bass, and they don't
equate emotion to it," she has
                  said. "I wanted to put a face on it."

                  "A mainstream champion like Madonna will help," says
Billboard's Larry Flick. "
                  'Ray Of Light' will do wonders for electronica. It's a
credible album that is going
                  to open a lot of doors for new artists. People are
hearing Madonna's album
                  and are intrigued to hear more of the genre."

                  Pop cultures need to adopt indigenous agendas to grow
genuine roots in new
                  host countries. And the United States is one of the
largest and most socially and
                  geographically dislocated of all nations, so this
organic development will
                  necessarily take longer than in Europe. As New
York-based journalist Joy Press
                  wrote, "America is a vast, diffuse territory where
ethnic, class and regional
                  allegiances have as much of an impact on pop as they
do on politics. While in
                  the U.K., rave became an essential part of music
culture and influenced
                  everything that came in its wake, in the U.S. it is
just a niche market."

                  To make sense to a wider listenership and chime with
mass tastes across such
                  a large market, the first techno band to break big may
well prove to be one
                  with a more developed sense of onstage showmanship and
songcraft. An
                  American Prodigy, perhaps, with big guitars and
swelling choruses. The early
                  warnings are already sounding: Mixmag's Darren Ressler
cites Rabbit in the
                  Moon from Tampa, DJ Icey from Orlando and the Crystal
Method; all snagged
                  deals as the majors scrabbled to process the
electronica signal.

                  "Like any genre, the second you have an identifiable
figure with a catchy song,
                  you have a hit. That really hasn't happened yet,"
Flick says. But "there is very
                  definitely an authentic club subculture. The
underground scene is incredibly
                  strong and creatively plush. There are no real stars
yet, but it looks promising.
                  The problem is that it's so expansive, almost too much
so, for such narrow
                  categorization. It also moves and evolves far too fast
for majors to keep up
                  with."

                  The Sound of Things to Come

                  Ultimately, none of this top-line stuff really matters
much. It's the geek-wizards
                  in their lofts, the tweaked-out club kids and the
'zine scribblers from the
                  boondocks, the obsessives who populate Internet
newsgroups like alt.rave who
                  represent electronica's future, if it is to have one.
"Musical innovation today is
                  happening in 17-year-old boys' bedrooms," says deejay
Justin Robertson, "like
                  the Aphex Twin recording his mum laughing and turning
that into a tune."

                  "Science and technology are transforming our world,
providing an age of
                  possibility and a time of change as profound as any we
have seen this
                  century," President Clinton told Congress last year.
He was talking about
                  industry but could equally have been mapping the pop
landscape:
                  Transformation is inevitable when the coming
generation is weaned on
                  computer games, sound cards and the Net. As Renaat
Vandepapeliere, head
                  of the respected European techno label R&S, once
declared: "People from this
                  generation learn computers in school like we learned
to write. Can you imagine
                  the music that these kids are going to make? The way
they are going to use
                  modern technology is going to be mind-blowing. This is
only the beginning."

                  And there are indications that the little guys are
growing in confidence,
                  beginning to walk with a swagger, just like their
counterparts did in Europe at
                  the turn of the '90s. Sample this letter to Mixmag,
written by a kid from Boise,
                  Idaho, who styles himself Dance Patriot: "We invented
techno and house music,
                  so why should the Chemical Brothers, Prodigy, and
Underworld take all the
                  credit? We should support our fledgling scene. Buy
American, and it's cheaper
                  than buying imports!" It's the ranters and ravers like
Dance Patriot, and his
                  compatriots in Orlando, Cleveland, Dallas -- the
evangelists, the hardcore
                  believers -- who will mutate the gene to breed an
intrinsically American strain
                  of electronica. The teens and twentysomethings who
want to breathe that
                  curious air, that heady compound of druggy
psychedelia, utopian reverie,
                  digital networking and militant urban attitude that
characterizes techno music
                  -- and to inhabit the eternal now that is the guiding
current of pop.

                  It could go something like this: After blurting out
his spleen on paper, our
                  letter-writer takes a moment to calm down. He switches
his computers on, taps
                  in a few digits and sets a cybernetic loop spooling
out of the speakers. It's a
                  clear night, so he opens the window, sparks up a
cigarette and watches the
                  smoke drift away into the cool air as the machines
sing gently to themselves.
                  Yes, he thinks, I can do it, it's time to cut this
track. Do it now.

                  GLOSSARY

                  House: Disco stripped down to drumbeat and bass line,
then rebuilt using
                  electronic equipment. Origin: Chicago, mid-'80s.

                  Techno: Strictly technology-based house music with
influences from British
                  electronic pop and German avant-garde. The term
"techno" is often used to
                  describe all forms of electronic dance music. Origin:
Detroit, mid-'80s.

                  Garage: A more overtly disco-influenced form of house
music, often with diva
                  vocals. Origin: New York, mid-'80s.

                  Ambient: New Age music meets techno, with quieter
drums. Origin: London, late
                  '80s (based on theory from producer Brian Eno, London,
mid-'70s).

                  Trip-Hop: Hip-hop without the rap, plus an intoxicated
psychedelic feel. Origin:
                  Bristol, England, early '90s.

                  Big Beat: Techno meets hip-hop and indie rock in the
style of the Chemical
                  Brothers. Origin: London, mid-'90s.

                  Drum 'n' bass: Speeded-up hip-hop beats with
reggae-style bass lines and
                  techno effects. Alias "jungle." Origin: London, early
'90s.

!!!!!!!!!!Greetings SFravers!!!!!!!!!!!!
My name is bobbi, I live in Vancouver, BC.
I'm finally getting the chance to visit!!!
I've been waiting months for this, so I want to do it right! It was
suggested to me by my fellow NorthWestravers that I enquire within your
list for suggestions on parties, clubs, music and used clothing stores,
and any other goings-on of the week of April 20 to 26. I have a listing
from the events calender (so I know I'm missing Dubtribe by two
days....sob), but I'm not sure where to go, so any suggestions would be
very much appreciated. I'm going to try to attend Divinity Returns,
anyone going who wouldn't mind a foreigner tagging along, or if you know
how I can get a ticket, please let me know!
I'll mention that I'm a 25 year old female who's been enjoying the
Vancouver scene since '91. I'm into almost everything:  progressive
house, funky and acid breaks, drumandbass, acid trance, trip hop,
ambient, some hip hop and some speed garage. I do not like (no offence!)
anything epic, gabber, or  overly cheesey house. I'd like to know which
parties and clubs have the friendliest, craziest crowds (as you already
know, vancouverites are lovely, but they can be a bit subdued), and the
best music. I'm very open-minded, but travelling alone for the most
part, so please warn me if any venues aren't in the safest area, or
difficult to get to, or if there's anything else I should know before I
venture out. Thanx everybody!
xxxooo!!!
bobbi

Hey all!

This is just an informal kind of bizarrish query of sorts, testing the
waters, looking for piranhas and to see if it's too cold. :)


Who..if anyone..would be interested in moving into a multi-bedroom fairly
nice (I've got my standards), house in the South Bay Area:

        San Jose, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Cupertino, Campbell

My lease is up at the place I live in Mid May, and one of my roommates is
moving to So Cal. As such, instead of trying to fill the room (I know what
a nightmare it was the last time, when Microsoft kidnapped one of them),
and continuing to pay entirely too much rent..I'm looking to cut expenses.

Anyone interested?

We've already got Rick (JediBitch), and his roommate (non-raver, but raver
friendly), interested..any others?

Speaking of noise, does anyone else out there religiously tune in to KFJC? If so, you may have caught yesterdays complete insanity - an entire days worth of broadcasting this WEIRD noise stuff (as in, I listened to it on the way to work at 8AM, and it was still going at 10PM.
What it was was broadcasts from shortwave radio stations of secret codes used by the intelligence networks - i.e. its lots of static with voices going 5..4..8..2..9..4 etc.. for hours on end, mixed in with strange distorted music.
Completely beautiful.
Andy T trainspotted it as a 5CD set on Irdial records. Pretty whacky.
Big up the KFJC massive - who's going to their Sit and Spin party on Sat with Mr Hate spinning? Should be wild.

aaaaaaaah no pleeeeeeeeeease.
you candy ravers just don't know where to stop.
teletubbies is not funny, there's no entertainment value (not even on
drugs). there's no content. it might be cute at first but that wears off
after the first 3 minutes. it's totally brainless. it's not for slow
learners. it's for babies. it's annoying and stupid and babyish. hate hate
hate! it's up there on the hate scale w/ the spice girls.

take it. you can have it. we don't want it. it's revenge time, for all the
american soaps. i wish you would get some cool good stuff from england like
*father ted* or *red dwarf*.

how awful!

	a TV show targeted to 1 year olds???

what is this world coming to???

...the day i sit my 1 year old child down to watch television...
if that's the sort of entertainment you want to feed your child at that
early of an age (if _any_ age for that matter...)- you shouldn't be
'qualified' to have children!

GEESH!

>this is a t.v. show *for 1 year-olds*.....how much were you able to
>understand when you were that age??
*probably enough to know whether my parents cared for me and wanted to give
me quality entertainment... like their love and attention!

i know i'm going off on a tangent... but that whole idea of TV for 1 year
old has gotten me outraged!

Hi Rave Friends,

        I have seen positive articles and features on raves, although
perhaps not as many as the negative ones if you're considering only
non-scene-oriented media.

        Also, having a bit of firsthand knowledge of the media, I've rarely
known an editor-type to reject a well-written letter to the editor simply
because they didn't agree with what the writer was promoting.  Remember,
they thrive on controversy; they *want* people to write who disagree with
them!

        Also often overlooked is that whether or not a letter is published,
it is being read in the newsrooom, often by multiple people, and sometimes
discussed.  Attitudes among media people are informed and changed by the
feedback they get from the public.

        Why not be part of that feedback?  Here's a short list of S.F.
media contact information to get you started...

        And back to the perennial drug issue.  If someone says, "Oh yeah,
it's all about drugs," I don't necessarily see that as negative.  Why does
it always have to be the drugs vs. the music?  I don't think raves would be
raves without either one of them.  If the U. in PLUR means anything -- and
I admit that personally I've always thought it was the vaguest part of the
acronym -- surely it means that we should be accepting of the various
musical and pharmicological tastes within our community.  If you can't even
achieve a semblance of unity with other ravers, who will you achieve it
with?

Far from PLURfect,

Hi Rave Friends,

        I'd read this thread a while ago, and noticed that e.menon said
Hitler was not a socialist.  I wanted to say something about this, because
there seems to be a lot of confusion about what socialism is.  As I see it,
there are two distinct types.

        Hitler was indeed a socialist, but more to the point, he was what I
call a "top-down socialist," i.e. one who favored social engineering by
force.  The Nazis believed in public education, gun control (for the
people, not the state), worker control of workplaces, better health care
for the elderly, etc., and they believed in using the power of government
to force others to support these changes.

        Sound like our government today?  You bet.  The only difference is
the extremes to which the politicians regularly go to impose their agenda.
(So far mass extermination by oven or gas chamber is not considered an
acceptable means in the U.S.A.)

        The alternatives to top-down socialism as practiced in Nazi Germany
or Soviet Russia or other miserable states are individualism, where people
work independently or in groups organized for non-violent competition, or
"bottom-up" socialism, where they band together in *voluntary* collectives.


        Sometimes these voluntary socialist mini-collectives may even do
radical and subversive things like throwing rave parties without the proper
permits.

Peace, love & liberty,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

Sounds good to me!  I just don't know of any parks in the area.  =\
I've been a South San Jose kid all my life, not Santa Clara!  Only been 
here about a year or so.I know there is one by my house, about a
block or two, which would be about a mile away from Chevy's.... 
I could get off my fat ass and look for it.  i know there's a golf course
across the street from where I live and there's all these damn
Duck Xing signs around where I live.  They've gotta be there for 
some reason!  ;)

I know of 2 parks in santa clara....one is right down the street from my
house--inbetween bucher ave, san tomas, homewood, and forbes.  I don't
know the name.  Then there's central park (?), sorta across from
kaiser-permanente on kiely ave.

fuck.  or we could use my backyard.  ;)

elvis costello, grateful dead thedoors and led zep, nina hagen fad
gadget the b52s and the police,  8 1/2 souvenirs (austin plug :P) and
finally 

*drum roll*

herb alpert and the tijuana brass.

so _that's_ what that was! i tuned in on my way home from work today, at
one point there was a cement truck next to me on the fwy, it was white
w/ black stripes, and since it was churnning, major spirals were
happening, NO i didn't hit happy hour after work, it's just that a that
moment the trippy sounds coinsided w/ the Betelguese cement truck,
~weird~
had to turn it off, traffic was getting to me :\
actually, it would be perfect elevator music for the one in my new
building, my boyz [Mook~Guy~Byron] know what i'm talking about [shudder]
i take the stairs ;)

>Very interesting.... My hair caught on fire....

        Well, my hair did not catch on fire, but my white jumpsuit is
trashed.  Definitely the wrong thing to wear to a Crash Worship show!  The
area in front of the stage was practically a mosh pit, with half-naked,
sweating people and lots of body paint.

        The most amazing thing about this event was that when we got there
around 9pm, the crowd was one of the most sedate I have seen.  People were
mostly sitting in small groups on the floor, or in chairs around the edge
of the big upstairs room at the Maritime Hall.  Somebody told me it would
get wild later, and I said, 'I don't think so, everybody's too relaxed.'
If you would have taken a picture at 9 o'clock, and another a few hours
later, and showed them to me, I would not have believed it was the same
bunch of people.  Even during the opening act, a girl-guitar band, everyone
was very laid back, with the notable exception of this one obnoxiously
drunk guy who kept shouting dumb things at the singer.  It was downright
roomy in front of the stage, with everyone sort of standing around,
eyes-forward.  Lots of cigarettes being smoked, although in the
high-ceilinged room I didn't find the smoke that noticeable.

        There did seem to be high expectations before the show, despite the
mellow vibe and smaller number of attendees than I'd expected to see for
this "cult" band.  One guy told me he'd come all the way from Cleveland to
see them, and was going to another show next week in Texas or someplace.
Still, most of the people there looked pretty average -- only a few looked
heavily punk or goth, the majority could have been at just about any event
anywhere.

        At some point after Crash Worship started though, the atmosphere
did a 180, and people really got into some frenzied dancing.  More body
paint appeared, and lots of shirts came off.  It was definitely an
experience.  There were several topless women on stage, dancing very, um,
sexually, and a float was carried through the crowd accompanied by drummers
and fire-eaters, at one point with a woman dispensing some kind of liquid
(?) from a sack, at another time a woman wearing a giant horned mask.  Some
of the footage would make an excellent fundraising video for the Christian
Coalition.  8)  There were some pretty cool visuals with text bits telling
a story about the Tower of Babel.  The music was mostly drums, but there
was some electronic stuff going on as well, overall it seemed very
trance-inducing, something that ravers might enjoy.  But of course the
friendly rave-vibe was absent.  The band also seemed to want to "control
the creative vision" as one person I talked to put it, limiting the amount
of audience participation.  One example:  Tired of being crushed and
jostled by the sea of bodies, and feeling exhibitionist as well, I got up
on stage for a bit to start dancing there as I'd seen a couple women do.
After a few brief exhilirating moments, one of the guys in the band without
warning tried to throw me into the crowd.  When that rude attempt failed,
he asked me to leave the stage.  I got the impression they are not as crazy
about having cute guys as cute girls up there with them, which also led me
to wonder about tonight's "women only" show advertised in the paper.

        Another lesson learned is that pot leaves one too relaxed and
mellow to get into truly proper Crash Worship mode.  Although I do wish
some of the folks there had been a bit mellower -- body contact while
dancing is good, but at a certain level it becomes downright dangerous.
I'm 6' tall and weigh about 165 lbs., but I felt it would have been quite
easy to suffer some grievous bodily harm while enjoying the show.

        I also lost my pager somewhere in the thick of things.  The first
time it fell off, a very sweet girl found it and gave it back to me, which
I should have taken as a warning to go and put it with my jacket in the
coat check.

        Slam-dancing your way to a bloody nose, or bloodying someone
else's, is not my idea of a good time.  The Crash Worship crowd was not
quite to that point I don't think, but they were definitely treading on the
edge.  On the bright side, you could hang on the edges of the main body of
dancers and still have a very unique, primal experience without having to
worry about your physical safety.

        Anyway, I didn't meet any other SFRavers there, although I ran into
Joe of peace-necklace fame, who I've seen at lots of raves.  I think it's
the first time in probably a dozen or more events I've seen him at that he
was without his booth, just there to enjoy the show.

        The overall verdict?  I had fun, and would recommend checking it
out, but I can't give a wholehearted endorsement.  The atmosphere reminded
me of some of the pagan abandon of Burning Man, which is a do-not-miss on
my list.  But BM has a lot of other elements that make it what it is that
were not present at CW, and I haven't witnessed the same level of physical
mayhem at Burning Man either, although it's certainly possible I just
wasn't in the wrong place at the wrong time.

May the bass be with us,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

I think an important thing to remember when discussing this kind of stuff 
is that there is a difference between "socialism" and "communism".

One deals with how individuals, groups and government interact 
(read: politics) and the other deals with the distribution of wealth 
(read: economics).

It all started with a visit to the hottest geekfest in town, the Netscape Mozilla source code launch party. Weird. Geeks completely going for it - turned out to be quite raging, all in all. 2000 people packed into a maze of a club (the Sound factory) with queues round the block - weird. Visuals of the source code scrolling past projected onto a huge screen were a nice touch.
Anyway, the main entertainment of the evening was Sabotage at El Pirata. Turned up at 11 - residents doing tag team with some funky techno and a bit of electro. The TV screens projecting a negative image of the DJ from the viewpoint of the mixer was a touch of genius.
The place got pretty full by midnight, when Alan Oldham, aka DJ T-1000, took to the decks. For the first half hour he kept it really deep and trancy, beautiful headfunk techno. Then, with one mix that just kept going over at least 5 minutes, he brought in a harder edge, and by then the quietly dancing crowd were ready for it - upping the ante and starting to cheer and shout. Up and up it went, harder and harder, more and more insane. A whole room of clued up clubbers writhing to the hard edged beats and crazy mixing skills. And finally Jeff Mills' "The Bells" was dropped (as it inevitably is at any techno gathering), and totally destroyed the throng - everyone jumping and hitting the air with their fists and screaming with the raw energy coursing through their bodies, extravenously injected through the big gateway speakers.
On and on it went, until 2.15 when all had to come to an end and the ovation T-1000 received was beautiful. We staggered out into the crisp San Francisco air, fully understanding how music can be a drug - and we had just got our fix. A great start to the new Sabotage night.

tv is sick, tv for kids is sicker.  i have a friend with a couple a
rugrats, they don't have a tv.  while other kids their age are
hyperactive brats who can't talk or think about anything but the power
rangers, mike's 2 kids are these amazing little otherwordly beings,
hyperactive too but in a much better way.  better adjusted, way more
creative, interested in the world around them...

but on the other hand, they do tend to get up and demand attention at
6 am sat morning, ugh.  which is where a television set comes in
handy.  it's the ultimate babysitter - just plop the little tykes in
front of the box, and they're guaranteed not to move again till you
make them...

but i would like to check out the teletubbies sometime.  sounds wierd...

due to interest on the list, i am reposting an old review of a crash
worship show i saw last year in oakland.  btw, tonight they are doing
another show, for women only ("crash worship asks that only women
attend this show...")  wish i could go, it should be interesting - cw
tends to take a theme and run with it...




crash worship review - thanksgiving day, '97
--------------------------------------------

after seemingly endless misadventures, chris, martha stewart, pjfuzzy
and myself finally made it to the warehouse at 2nd and jackson, only
to wait about 3 hours for cw to start playing.  beyond race was making
swirly arabian/ambient shadow music while a dj spun in the other room.
 then some slacker with a distorted acoustic guitar made beckish
beefhearty skronking noises for a while (normally i dislike anything
that smacks of indie rock but i had to admit the guy was rather
entertaining, whoever he was). i listened and danced till finally at
3:13 am crash worship stormed the warehouse.  wow.  how can you
possibly describe a crash worship show?

dozens of torches were lit to drum swells and the germano-yiddish
strains of a string trio.  topless dancers spun flaming batons as
platters of semi-clad girls were hoisted around the warehouse.  a
woman standing next to me whistled a long drone along with the
violins, i accompanied her by whistling an indian melody as the dozen
drumers softly banged their way through the crowd...  a 6 foot tall
man with flaming horns threw handfuls of firecrackers into the masses,
dousing the floor and audience with flammible liquids before burning
his hat in a flaming pyre that mushroomed up to the wooden rafters. 
then things started to get crazy...

the drum core beat a furious tattoo as the mosh pit started to
writhe... band members wandered through the crowd with mylar sacks of
red franzia, soaking the crowd in dyonesian revelry.  wine drenched
shirts came off...  celebrating the harvest season, i scarfed half of
a "special" cigarette with pj, then passed it off into the swirling
masses...  the same platters that held the half-naked women now held
fruit and spit-roasted suckling pigs.  the element of danger added a
keen edge to my high - an orange hit me on the side of the face,
stinging my eye - what if that had been one of the bottle rockets the
guy with the horns was shooting into the oil soaked crowd?  a
beautiful woman did acrobatics hanging from a rope attached to the
ceiling as the strings lilted.  the drummers beat louder and faster as
she spun and spun and spun...  the tempo picked up again, those guys
could make a pretty phat beat when they put their minds to it, i was
sucked into the crowd once again...  a semi-neud couple necked in the
middle of it all, i lightly caressed them as i floated by, they didn't
seem to mind...  louder, faster, louder, louder, my ears were
splitting as the whole scene built to a crazy creshendo till suddenly
at 4:23 the cops busted in and shut off the sound system.  but of
course that couldn't stop the drummers, who continued to wander
through the crowd beating furiously as the police tried to chase them
down.  meanwhile the string quartet was now being pushed through the
crowd by naked men on a viking ship with wheels as they handed out
grapes to the revelers and the beautiful woman had stripped off her
fishnets and was doing more erotic ballet hanging from another spot on
the ceiling...  the five cops and ten security guys were still trying
to get the 400 or so people out the door, they were arguing with the
drummers, who (practically at gunpoint) led a bunch of us out the door
and onto the street, where they continued to play and dance till 4:36
am - one hour and 23 minutes later.


funny thing about crash worship - the first time i saw them they did
the same show (minus circus acts and pigs) to 13 people in a small
club in raliegh n.c. one wednesday.  my roomate knew one of the band
members from art school, so we invited them to stay the night at our
20's farmhouse in bynum (pop 223).  ALL RIGHT, i thought, THE PLACE IS
GONNA GET TRASHED!  COOL!  you can imagine my (pleasant?) surprise
when, upon their arrival at our house, their drummer dreike made
herbal tea for everyone while chit-chatting with me and my wife, and
then they all went promptly to sleep - but not before washing out all
their mugs and placing them neatly to dry on the dishrack.  _very_
nice people...

um, i'm gonna restrict this to what i've been listening to lately
(like this week), lifetime faves is just too hard to chose...

5. van morrison
4. marvin gaye
3. vivaldi guitar concertos
2. foxy brown soundtrack (foxy not jackie)
1. missy/aaliyah/timbaland

i _really_ dig those timbaland produced cd's, yeah they're pop r&b,
but in the best way possible.  timbalands production reminds me of
jungle sometimes, the way he switches the beat around, but it's slow
and deep instead of hyper like jungle.  the alliyah cd is like upbeat
pop and "quiet storm" stuff, while the missy cd is darker, more rap,
heavier beats.  both are exellent, i think they stand up with any of
the motown classics, or any other "classic" r&b - i listened to them
all last summer, and all winter, and they're still in heavy rotation
in my car...

Hey all,
   theres a program on the web called winamp
   < http://www.mindspring.com/~farsyde/winamp.html>
 i've been using for a few months. Basicly it's c/d quality sound,
 from the web. 
 the program to record mp3's (the files that Winamp plays)
 is freeware. I'm telling all of you this in hopes that some of you,
 the ones who spin, will record some of your work in mp3 format.
 if anyone can tell me of any existing mp3 techo sites 
 I'd love you forever, (not that I don't already) 

                       sorry for the spam,
                                                    Carl

Skankin Pickle are awesome. I love that song "Fakin' Jamacan"
I've seen em live before and they tore it up.
Heard of the Dead Milkmen but didn't get to much into the Punk/Ska scene
before I started getting more into techno.

i'd like to ask this sweet girl how long she's been into jungle, and/por
how many parties she's been to..
coz...
every true junglist would know that dancing is the ultimate release of
stress and emotion for a nuttah. it's all GOOD not WEIRD... what's wrong
with dancing like a nuttah? it's all GOOD! how can y
i thought the show was a little weird coz of all the people STANDING
AROUND... whats upw ith THAT !!! weird...
i mean, are you people TIRED, that's all good yeah.. coz i know what its
like to have a bad back and all.. but i dunno, how can you call as show
weird cox of crazy dancers when you're talking about a JUNGLE GIG?!
if the guy's dancin a lil crazy, so be it.. he's groovin to the shit
HARDCORE and i give him MAD PROPS no matter HOW weird he looks -- coz at
least he GOT THE PASSION! 
 and
singing to drumnbass -- have you ever heard of MC'S?!?!?! they're
essentail to a kickass live show! they're singing in a sense, rapping,
whatever... 
funky divas and shit, they know what's up.. they add FLAVA to the beats,
SOUL to the groove. 

well to make a long story short:
if you've never heard of singing to drumnbass
and if you think dancing crazy at a junglegig is weird...

you got alot to learn about junglists.

give it up for the crazyass true  junglists
they got mad stylez and funkalicious flava!!

much respect that you had fun jumpupgrrrl but you gotta learn to respect
and understand all aspects of the scene, whether you're into it or not.
coz the singers and the dancers hold it together... they're contributing
to the mad amount of frenzy and love and passion that bust out a phat
wicked party. ya dig?

   I'm back in SF, looking forward to a good weekend.  Tonight starts
   it off with the Stonesthrow Showcase party at DNA with a lot
   of turntable action, and the XLR8R party at Sound Design.  

   Friday features house, trance and jungle at Deep, Frequency, and
   the Trance & Jungle Factory party; or catch Scott Henry and Dara
   at Nikita.  Saturday is highly competitive with a big lineup
   at Bionic, a mostly local star lineup at Intoxication, a stop
   by the Ninjatune guys, the Green Gorilla Lounge down south, and
   the Pablo's Anniversary.

ART OF THE NINJA: 
Ian Dury said "Do it yourself, it's cheaper and more fun" and he was
right. The only way to be real is to do it yourself. MATT BLACK and
JONATHON MORE's (a.k.a. Coldcut) near-death experiences with Big Life
and Arista Records convinced them that being as independent as possible
is of the essence. Ninja Tune was born out of a desire to side-step the
bull of major industry dealings, and over the last seven years the label
has continued to expand on the D.I.Y. philosophy that gave it birth.
Matt has a background in computers and biochemistry, Jonathon is a
former silversmith and art teacher. Having DJed at countless legendary
London parties they met at Reckless Records. Their mutual interest in
mixing led in Jan 87 to their first record, 'SAY KIDS, WHAT TIME IS
IT?', acknowledged as the first UK DJ 'sampling' record predating 'Pump
Up the Volume' (which actually samples Say Kids.) After this, their
notorious Remix for Eric B and Rakim's 'Paid In Full', brought major
acclaim. Big Life Records launched their artists Yazz and Lisa
Stansfield with Coldcut collaborations and productions.Throughout
Coldcut have maintained their commitment to the DIY & independent ethic.
After pressure from Arista to deliver more pop hits, they formed NINJA
TUNE/NTONE to provide a no bullshit outlet for their own music; Ninja
has since evolved into one of the most successful cutting edge
underground labels often credited with 'inventing' the 90s triphop
style, although they maintain that no-one 'invents' anything. Ninja's
diverse stable of artists continue this philosophy, funking up heads
across the globe with their eclectic blend of music selection and
multi-turntable tricknology.

THE HERBALISER - Jake Wherry and DJ Ollie Teeba are the Herbaliser.
Jake, grew up on a diet of jazz and James Brown. Ollie Teeba caught the
DJ bug at the age of 15 and progressed from spinning tunes in his
bedroom to playing clubs and warehouses. A mutual love of anything fat
and jazzy brought the pair together in 1992 and 'The Herbaliser' was
born. The Herbaliser sound lies between turntables and trombones,
updating a deep jazz and hiphop sound with today's sophisticated
production techniques, whilst keeping a vibrant feel to their music,
courtesy of some thumping double-bass, horn section and heavy use of
breaks. Current Release: Blow Your Headphones

DJ VADIM - Born in Russia, he has lived in London since the tender age
of three. His first release on Ninja Tune was "Non Lateral Hypothesis'
in April 1996. Apart from real Hip Hop, Vadim is inspired by creaking
doors, answering machines, musique concrete, running water and creates a
unique collage with, as main ingredients, the fattest, slowest, weirdest
beats ever recorded. Much deeper than Portishead, more daring than
Earthling, dope enough for B-boys, cool enough for Jazz Kats. Current
Release: USSR Reconstruction

CHOCOLATE WEASEL - The mighty T Power and his sampler-wielding
accomplice Chris Stevens burst open the righteous wardrobe and dust off
their spangled waistcoasts and lurex flares and get down breakdancing in
gold platform trainers. Music For Body Lockers is slick rick body
popping too fonky! Current release: Spaghettification & Music for Body
Lockers

NEOTROPIC - If the tone of today's testosterone tunes leaves ya a trifle
cold, feel the beat of female heat in regions neotropical. Riz Maslen is
Neotropic. Having also recorded under the pseudonym "Small Fish With
Spine" Riz's electronic landscapes is a welcome antidote to the world of
too many boyz making too much noise. Current release: 15 Levels Of
Magnification

HEXSTATIC - VJing is doing with visuals what a DJ does with music,
attempting to take the audio excitement that a good club DJ/sound system
provides, and ramp up the audiences' visual stimulation to an equal
energy level. In 1993 Hex started melding people's minds at the now
legendary Telepathic Fish squat parties with Matt Black's (Coldcut)
punky vhs set-up. Stuart Warren-Hill (HexStatic) has been at the
forefront of developments in new computer techtainment. From the video
sampling eco-friendly game 'Top Banana', and 7 groundbreaking
interactive music CD+ releases, to art installations for 2 major
galleries, and promoting VJing as a club artform. Current release:
Timber - Enhanced CD collaboration with Coldcut

Place and time: somewhere in the Soviet Union in the 1930s.

The phone rings at KGB headquarters.
"Hello?"
"My neighbor Yankel Rabinovitz is an enemy of the State.  He is hiding
undeclared diamonds in his woodshed."
"This will be noted."

The next day, the KGB goons go over to Rabinovitz's house. They search the
shed where the firewood is kept, break every piece of wood, find no
diamonds, swear at Rabinovitz, and leave.

The phone rings at Rabinovitz's house.
"Hello, Yankel! Did the KGB come?"
"Yes."
"Did they chop your firewood?"
"Yes, they did."
"Okay, now it's your turn to call. I need my vegetable patch plowed."

Well my plans for a So-Cal road trip got destroyed by El Nino. So looks like
I will be in the Bay to party this weekend.

Anybody going to the T&J Factory party tonight??? I'll be the raggedly tired
looking one. My hair will probably be kinda fro-ee as with all the dancing
it won't want to stay still.

 I am also thinking of hitting the Rebel Alliance party as I don''t like
spending huge amounts of $$$ on massives like Bionic.

Either email me (I might not get any mail about tonite til tomorrow) or page
me 510-297-2510 after 10pm tonite

Thanx and see you on the dance floor

Phunckateck is going to be going off again soon.  They will be hosting
Goldie soon, for those who are into the BIG name stuff.  No, Cat's Grill has
been closed for a while, renovations.  

They do the third Saturday each month at the top.   And soon DJ Noel will
put out a message to tell you all the haps.  I believe Phunckateck will be
hapening again on May 6th.  

The Phunckateck info line number is:  415.331.1500 X160

due to interest on the list, i am reposting an old review of a crash
worship show i saw last year in oakland.  btw, tonight they are doing
another show, for women only ("crash worship asks that only women
attend this show...")  wish i could go, it should be interesting - cw
tends to take a theme and run with it...




crash worship review - thanksgiving day, '97
--------------------------------------------

after seemingly endless misadventures, chris, martha stewart, pjfuzzy
and myself finally made it to the warehouse at 2nd and jackson, only
to wait about 3 hours for cw to start playing.  beyond race was making
swirly arabian/ambient shadow music while a dj spun in the other room.
 then some slacker with a distorted acoustic guitar made beckish
beefhearty skronking noises for a while (normally i dislike anything
that smacks of indie rock but i had to admit the guy was rather
entertaining, whoever he was). i listened and danced till finally at
3:13 am crash worship stormed the warehouse.  wow.  how can you
possibly describe a crash worship show?

dozens of torches were lit to drum swells and the germano-yiddish
strains of a string trio.  topless dancers spun flaming batons as
platters of semi-clad girls were hoisted around the warehouse.  a
woman standing next to me whistled a long drone along with the
violins, i accompanied her by whistling an indian melody as the dozen
drumers softly banged their way through the crowd...  a 6 foot tall
man with flaming horns threw handfuls of firecrackers into the masses,
dousing the floor and audience with flammible liquids before burning
his hat in a flaming pyre that mushroomed up to the wooden rafters. 
then things started to get crazy...

the drum core beat a furious tattoo as the mosh pit started to
writhe... band members wandered through the crowd with mylar sacks of
red franzia, soaking the crowd in dyonesian revelry.  wine drenched
shirts came off...  celebrating the harvest season, i scarfed half of
a "special" cigarette with pj, then passed it off into the swirling
masses...  the same platters that held the half-naked women now held
fruit and spit-roasted suckling pigs.  the element of danger added a
keen edge to my high - an orange hit me on the side of the face,
stinging my eye - what if that had been one of the bottle rockets the
guy with the horns was shooting into the oil soaked crowd?  a
beautiful woman did acrobatics hanging from a rope attached to the
ceiling as the strings lilted.  the drummers beat louder and faster as
she spun and spun and spun...  the tempo picked up again, those guys
could make a pretty phat beat when they put their minds to it, i was
sucked into the crowd once again...  a semi-neud couple necked in the
middle of it all, i lightly caressed them as i floated by, they didn't
seem to mind...  louder, faster, louder, louder, my ears were
splitting as the whole scene built to a crazy creshendo till suddenly
at 4:23 the cops busted in and shut off the sound system.  but of
course that couldn't stop the drummers, who continued to wander
through the crowd beating furiously as the police tried to chase them
down.  meanwhile the string quartet was now being pushed through the
crowd by naked men on a viking ship with wheels as they handed out
grapes to the revelers and the beautiful woman had stripped off her
fishnets and was doing more erotic ballet hanging from another spot on
the ceiling...  the five cops and ten security guys were still trying
to get the 400 or so people out the door, they were arguing with the
drummers, who (practically at gunpoint) led a bunch of us out the door
and onto the street, where they continued to play and dance till 4:36
am - one hour and 23 minutes later.


funny thing about crash worship - the first time i saw them they did
the same show (minus circus acts and pigs) to 13 people in a small
club in raliegh n.c. one wednesday.  my roomate knew one of the band
members from art school, so we invited them to stay the night at our
20's farmhouse in bynum (pop 223).  ALL RIGHT, i thought, THE PLACE IS
GONNA GET TRASHED!  COOL!  you can imagine my (pleasant?) surprise
when, upon their arrival at our house, their drummer dreike made
herbal tea for everyone while chit-chatting with me and my wife, and
then they all went promptly to sleep - but not before washing out all
their mugs and placing them neatly to dry on the dishrack.  _very_
nice people...

hey Drakonis,
Thomas' original plan was to sell tickets at the door, but i talked to him
this morn & he's expecting it to sell out because of the lineup.   You
should call him @ 510-704-9876 and find out how many he has left, and see
if you can work something out.

You asked:

        Well, I had yellow ski goggles on my forehead and was also wearing
a silver rain jacket over the jumpsuit when I arrived.  Later on I had the
jumpsuit unzipped down the front and my body smeared with some of that
cancer-causing silver glitter (good one Monty, I actually forwarded that
post to someone thinking you were in earnest before I thought twice and
realized I'd been had!)

        I don't know if the jumpsuit was DuPont or not, it doesn't have any
labels on the outside that I've ever noticed, and as far as who made it, I
doubt I could answer that question about hardly anything in my closet.  I
don't think it was designed to be disposable, but if bleach doesn't do the
trick I may be disposing of it soon.

May the bass be with you,

have you given any thought to the size of a cd-quality mp3 of
a DJ spinning for any decent amount of time?  You're looking
at something like 1Minute = 1Meg.

45+Meg mp3 files are probably going to be a pain for most
people to download.  even on a T1/T3 it would be annoying.

just a though...

Who cares if the show is aimed at 1-3 year olds, the fact is that it is excellent adult viewing too. It's like Southpark - 60% of the viewers are over 18. In the UK they rapidly changed the original programming schedule from 7.30AM to showing a repeat at 10AM so all of the students could watch it (students in the UK are lazy fat asses. I should know.)
Watch out for the episode where Dipsy throws a ball up in the air and it comes down as a giant letter E. Subtle or wot.

I'll give a review :)  The DJ booth was way up off the dance floor, so
there was *no* interaction potential, strike one.  Strike two: the band had
just ended their set, and it being 1am and a weeknight, everyone had this
bleary look in their eyes, and I could just hear half the crowd say to
their other half, "gee, I wonder how many messages I've got in my inbox
this evening...".  The fact that they shut the bar down didn't help :)
Strike three.  So given those circumstances I'd venture I played an OK set;
I didn't haul out anything fancy, just used the club's Gemeni CD players,
so no fancy warping of the sound either.  So this was a glorified "play a
few toons I like for some friends" gig, beyond anything else.  I saw a few
dozen folks left writhing around to the music so I guess it was liked by
those who stayed.

Markie spun a great set in the same room, and kept it packed in between the
band's two sets.  The man is *such* a professional.  Rocky (caliban) played
a nice trippy set before the band's first set, too - anyone catch him last
night on KZSU closing out the "day of noise"?

I received this today.  It has absolutely nothing to do with raving.
Unless, perhaps, raving helps develop the altruistic and compassionate
side of our natures.
I just thought some people on this list would be interested.
Have a good weekend, everybody!

I was in the 'main' room, waiting until 1:30pm, for Brian to start.  I
figured he'd be much better than the wanker playing bad industro-pop/big
beat there.

1:30 came and went, no brian...so I started to wander...and then found him
just before he finished in the 'live band' room...I didn't even know there
were dj's in there.  A nice little drum'n'bass track was playing...ah,
much better.  The red lights on the mirror ball were very 60's lounge-ish.
Then he played some way slow shuffle track, let loose a puff of smoke from
the fog-hog, and stopped.  bummer.

I was the guy with almost no-hair lurking in the green jacket at the foot
of the stage.  I woulda come up and said howdy, but you looked like you'd
rather not be disturbed by some wanker from the sfraves list.  ;)

from the "DJ Kicks" series from Studio!K7 -- Smith and Mighty

A very broad ranging mix ranging from some of those classic '89
"Bristol Soul Sound" to brit-trip-hip-hop, to dub, to drum and bass...
I've been into the Smith and Mighty sound ever since my trip to bristol
in '89 (I used to work at HP, so I got to visit HP bristol for work...
and check out their scene at night...). Other than Smith and Mighty's
"Bass is Maternal" and major record label push for groups like Massive
Attack and Tricky, I really haven't seen any releases whatsoever with
that bristol sound I like.

Well, this one has a nice mix of them, and it's a nice mix. 

It's so nice to hear a mix that isn't just straight up same-tempo, same
sound, boom boom boom boom (for house), or straight-up same-temp
bo-chk-chk-chk-fuzzz-fuzzz-bwaaaaa-bwaaaaa-bwaaaaa of jungle. This one
mixes it up with niceness, if ya know wha' I mean.

Given that I'm a rather disturbed individual anyways, it wouldn't have been
a problem.

hello all you musically intellectual peoples,

There's a song at the begining of Taylor's "Live at the Metropolis" where some
chick (yes, i said "chick!") sings a little diddy kinda like...  "Calling your
name..  can't you here me...  calling your name...  yada yada yada... "  well,
i love that song!  does anyone know the name of the song and/or who sings it?
i think Taylor did the techno remix, but what about the original?  was it non-
techno?  any info will help (artist, label, year, etc)  shanks a buncha! =)

wuvs,
-=wyv=-

communism:  any theory or system of common ownership of property

socialism:  a theory by which the means of production and distribution 
are owned by society rather than by individuals

No, in a communist system, for example, you couldn't steal my shit.  I 
couldn't steal your shit.  In fact, nobody could steal anybody's shit 
because nobody has any shit.  All the shit that we have belongs to all of 
us as a group and to none of us as individuals.  You wouldn't be 
stealing, you'd just be moving shit from place to place.  I see no 
contravention here.  :)

larceny:  the unlawful taking of another's property (IBID p 333)

Larceny is a criminal act.  I thas nothing to do with politics.  But in 
a society that does not recognize private ownership of property, larceny, 
by definition, could not exist.

> ...is theft an economic act? <well yes, cause I redistribute resources and
> especially yes if i profit from your stuff >

You can only profit if there is gain in the trade of goods or services.  
In a system of group ownership of property, you could try day and night to sell 
something and you'd never get a buyer because if someone really wanted 
that item, all they'd have to do is come and get it and use it.

 There have been many questions asked about PHUNCKATECK....hopefully I can
address them all here.

                                              ***********

PHUNCKATECK is no longer at Cats Alley. They closed down in Jan. to retrofit
the club. We have a once a month deal at THE TOP (every third Saturday of the
month / 21+ ), in the meantime. 

We'd like to announce that PHUNCKATECK is starting up in about a month or so
at a new location, under the new name "DIGITAL".  Our opening night special
guest will be *GOLDIE*.
 

Due to a lack of venues that permit 18+ events, we are sorry to announce that
our new night will be 21+.  Each and every week, we will offer a special out-
of-town guest, whether they be from the UK or stateside. So, expect this
summer to blow up Junglewise in S.F. !!!!!!!!!!!

Call our info line for date & location Information at:

                                       415-331-1500 ext. 160

well, not one single post i've made to the sfraves newsgroup (or any of my
private ones for that matter) have made it through lately, so i'm
skeptical of this one too.  still, the sysadmin told me the problem with
fixed, so heregoes.

i just got back from 'the edge' nightclub in palo alto, and despite being
a retched hole, i had a lot of fun.  regardless, it made me yurn for a
good rave.

so here's the low-down.

i'll be living in the bay area for just under 1 more month... then i move
back to canada.  i've been to a couple of your parties, and met some very
cool kids.. 

anyhow, i'm really looking to rave at -least- once more before i go, so if
anybody from the south bay is going to any decent parties (ie.  like
tonight, saturday :) ), gimmie an email! :)  i'd prefer
trance/jungle/house, but y'know, all i really want to do is meet s'more
california kids and have a great time. 

if this fits your bill, send me a messy.  this goes for you too haze,
lacey & gang. :) 

and just incase this message -does- make it through, i appologize for all
the people i've been neglecting--it's the email server, honest! :)

have a good weekend kids,

- jason

Ok, here is the deal. I got in touch with this dude who posted from Indiana.
He wanted to come down and rave and have a good time Saturday night. He was
looking fo someone who could give him a ride to the rave and introduce him to
some peeps. I replied and told him I would tell him what parties are going on
and how to get there but I am tapped on cash and couldnt party this weekend.
He said if I came from SanJose to meet him at the SANFRAN youth hostile and
take him to a party, he'd cover my ticket and a "party favor"  Ok,cool.....he
sems alright. He is older and kind of a hippie raver.....I am not getting bad
vibes about this and yet a 6th sense is telling me something.....If anyone who
lives in the Sanfran Area who is going to Rebel Alliance ( there has got to be
someone!) would like to help meet up, that would be cool. He said he would
like to meet some local peeps too...
I just am really cautios about sketchy and uncertain situations and wanted to
hear some opinion. I cant just ditch hime, he flew up yesterday and is at the
youth hostile today. 

I spoke with him on the phone twice and all. He has this huge vison of going
to a rave and dancing his ass off and taking some "vitamins" that he cant get
in Indians and just having a great time. Thats beautiful, if all is good. =)
Sorry to spam folks. 
Take care

welp i never made it to trance factory ... :( ... that was majorly
depressing ... how come the south bay didnt have tickets being sold in the
area ... i mean we would like to go to the good underground raves too :( ...

and given that my CD player is still broken ... :( ... i need a major good
party to lift my spirirts back up ... i was hoping Trance Factory would do
that but somebody forgot us in the south bay ...

i have some hopes for bionic tonight although the lineup doesnt look that
exciting ... also is it just me or does it smell like a somewhat massive
party ... i would like to know how many of you are going to be there tonight
and what you think the music will be like (what type of music i mean) ...

i might also be able to give jason a ride if i decide to go to that party
...

last night i thought of going to the edge but i decided to check out
downtown san jose instead and landed at the usual for that 80's music thing
they got ... it wasnt too bad - i actually enjoyed some of the old classics
such as "dance on dance" by carrera i believe ...

:)

Can someone tell me what the Astrobeats room is?
One of the ideas im working on for the art party is
a room completely decorated in astrological symbolism
and music that creates the astrological experience
so that people can see what astrology really is about.
So many still think it's some kind of fortune telling or
this stuff that you see in the newspapers. Anyone
interested in helping with that, let me know.

jungle factory....lots of typical kids that go a lot......there were some new
faces, but it was cool.......micron spun a good set i was happy to hear it
(too bad he had to deal with the speakers not working right) it is all good
though because the set was good anyways but anything is when there is lots of
talent envolved..... everyone else was great too but i am to tired to respond
about them all....uumm well i had a great time there was a good crowd, the
only thing that sucked was that someone was caught stealing a thomas had to
escort him out and it was such a good party to be stopped at the end by
that... it sucked oh well i still had fun yay.. now i am on my to the peoples

    Well, I saw lots of south bay people saying they're going to the Bionic
.... which doesn't make sense to me because the Green Gorilla Lounge is like
in downtown SJ.  A few of us are meeting up to go to this party so I'm
lookin' forward to it.  : )  There will be SFR representation there so don't
be shy, you can buck the trend!

i thought nobody would show up at the green gorilla lounge ... last time i
went to GGL i ended up all alone which i didnt mind too much as the music
was good but the lineup for tonight is a little weak ... decisions ...
decisions ... i'll show up at the GGL and then head to bionic if it sucks
... i totally believe that we should support the south bay scene ...

ill probably be a little late as i'm headed to a private disco party before
that ... i hate disco by the way - i'm just going to that party to express
my displeasure ... also GGL only goes on until 2am right ? so what do we do
the rest of the night ?

nico ... need a ride bro ?

Of course, I neglected to mention that Brian Transeau (BT) was very much
involved. In fact, both Taylor and Brian engineered the track in DC, near BT's
home.

If its the track I'm thinking of its orinaly by Anomaly and Talyor
did that phat remix of it. Its pretty tracy mounmentic type sound.  Its on
Platypus label and came out a year or so ago.  Hope thats the one your
thinking of.  If not its a great track to look for anyway.

Hi i'm kind of new on thislist but i just wanted to put my couple of 
centz in on crashworship and all that.  First of all i would say if you 
really want to get into one of their shows it is much better at the 
location they usually play at on 2nd st. in Oakland.  That place is a 
big ol' abandoned warehouse with two rooms, and one room has a more ravy 
trance-house atmosphere while the other one has the more tribal 
fire-eating atmosphere.  For a raver the Oakland location would be 
better and probably for anyone else also.  I feel like at the maritime 
there were more 'rules', whereas at the warehouse things were freer.

  Even so I had so much fun at this show and pretty much forgot my mind 
and name with no drugs.  Somewhere I read that if you learn the path to 
the lsd or the shroom state you can find your way back again without the 
aid of the drug.  I felt like the music and the collective consciousness 
did that for me.  It was a moment of pure satanic joy.
You stop and listen in the middle of the show and the vocals sound so 
insane like the roar of a dinosoar or the silver scream of an elephant 
from outer space.  

  As far as what starchild was sayin' bout sexism, I guess I could 
understand that but I didn't really see anything unconsensual going on.  
It's human nature i think.  I've been making a project of photographing 
their shows and got a couple shots with a real positive feel this time.  

latah,

             digs

 to the mad amount of frenzy and love and passion that bust out a phat
 wicked party. ya dig?

Following is something from another rave list
that i thought some of you might be interested in exploring.
I personally dont care for the new agey lightworker
style of the message but the experiment seems
like something at least worth trying for anyone interested
in world peace or spirituality. I am not connected with this
or supporting it...just passing it along for you to
form your own opinions of. Check out the web site for more info.

I think I am have communed with the pixels on my computer screen
too much. I am going to turn into one unless I turn off this machine.

It was a pretty good party.  I had a lot of fun.  Of course I was
completely out of my mind due to some candEE I had at the party.  This
candEE was pretty kosher.  Too bad you can't find this candEE at liquor
stores or snackbars.  N E Ways, I enjoyed the music and the small
setting.  Prime stuff.  It was cool also 'cause it was my first Trance
and Jungle Factory party.  I'm so used to shopping there but I have never
partied there.  Boomerang came through with a lovely ambient set and some
good literature to go along with it.  Man, that guy has some nutty
stories.  It kinda sucked however since some dickhead was stealing shit. 
Apparently, somebody ganked a 1200 also.  That's fucked up.  Thomas does
a lot for the scene and people are here not even aware and just fucking
it up for everybody else.  It was good seeing all the familiar faces that
I met........ya'll know who you are so I'm not going to strain my brain
remembering who.

Well, I guess that little spiel of mine about not partying was once again
wrong.  So for future reference........fuck it, I'm always going to
party, maybe not all the time but atleast every so often.

C U all at the Viberation party.

Hey everyone... 
     I am embarassed to even talk about this... but it's not just something
that's affecting me... it's something that's affecting some of my friends in
the scene too... so I'm asking you for some advice on how to deal with this
little drama thing that's going on with me lately...
     First of all... there's a girl in the scene that I used to date.  Things
didn't work out... and we didn't part on the best of terms.  No big deal,
right..?  I mean, it happens to everyone sometime in their life.  O.K.  So I
haven't talked to this girl since October... I have seen her at a few parties
lately... (The Gathering, Harmony, Skillz, skillz afterparty, Tranceforce, and
last night at Bionic...).  Though I regret that she and I aren't friends now,
I accept that it's her choice, and I respect her wishes.  The times I've seen
her at parties, I haven't tried to talk to her.  I haven't approached her. I
haven't followed her.  I don't look at her.  In short, I respect her.  The
last thing I would ever do is try to bring a bad vibe into the scene which has
shown me much love and a feeling of community.  A sense of belonging...  When
she sees me at a party, if she's dancing and sees me, she looks at me with
evil eyes.  I look away.  If I walk into a room where she's just chilling...
she will bail.  At first, that reaction toward me really bothered me because
I've never in my life had such a negative reaction towards my "existence".
But I've come to accept that it's just the way it is and I don't let it bother
me anymore.  I've talked to some of you about this drama before and everyone's
agreed that it sucks, but what else can you say...!  I feel the same way.
     But for some reason, I guess the fact that I don't do any of those things
I mentioned isn't enough for her.  For last night, she was at Bionic and had
brought many of her friends with her.  (As this post has already gone long....
I will sum up some of the events that took place....)
1.  her little brother (age 13...) and another guy were <always..> right
behind me when I was dancing... and I caught them both kicking empty water
bottles toward me while I was dancing... whenever I would move somewhere else,
sooner or later, they were there too. <my guess is to try and make me trip on
the bottles>
2.  I was giving a friend a back rub in the chill area... and another one of
her friends came by and took a picture of that.  my friend is alot younger
than I am... and I've known her since january.  <my guess is that a picture is
soon to appear at a party near you... flaming me or something....>
3.  another guy was following me all night.  at first I thought I was
tripping... but I wasn't on anything hallucinagenic, so you be the judge...
and once when I went from the main room to the jungle room, this guy walked
through the room looking left and right for someone.  he passed me without
noticing me, so I followed him.  when he got to the end of the room and turned
around, it startled him to see that I was following about 15 feet behind.
<the shocked look on his face confirmed my suspicions...>
4.  I went with a couple of friends from the list into the chill area to relax
a little and I noticed one of her friends talking to a security guy.  <why am
I noticing these things you ask?  because weird things had been happening all
night!> he then made 3 trips to the chill area checking things out.  the first
two times he just came and left.  but the third time, he walked to the cyclone
gate and let himself into the "off limits" area but didn't close the door
completely.  he kept poking his head out looking toward me, but when he would
see me looking back, he would step back.  then he would look again.  finally,
he just kept staring... so I approached him and started up a conversation.
during our conversation, he asked me things like "what time did I get
there..?", "who did I know there..?", "did I come with anybody..?", and "did I
come with the people I was sitting down with..?".  <I don't know what her
friend said to him, but it was obvious that he was there because of me. but I
am not! a dealer, and have not EVER harrassed anyone at a party!  ....or ever,
for that matter....>
5.  while I was talking to some other friends on the list who were on the
dance floor, one of her friends walked by and spit something out of her mouth
onto my female friend's back.  I yelled at her but she kept walking.  <this
whole drama has now reached a new low....>
6.  toward the end of the party, I separated myself from my friends because if
someone has a problem with me, IT STAYS WITH ME!!!  I don't want anybody to
suffer as a result of (my...) personal problems.  <but as I was sitting at the
tables near the front entrance to the party, I noticed 3 security personnel
just staring at me.  my returned stares did not stop them from staring.  and
some of the people who I'd encountered during the evening had also stopped
near the exit and were staring at me.  at this point, as dramatic as this may
seem, I feared for my personal safety and asked another friend from the list
(rather intimidating in size...) to walk out with me.  I did  not tell him
about the drama, but only wanted a show of support...>
**Now.... I've met many of you peeps and have made some really great friends.
Those of you who know me I trust will have a VERY favorable thought in regards
to me.  And for those of you who don't know me... let me tell you this:  my
screen name refers only to a play on the word dysfunctional and refers to my
having been brought up in an alcoholic, 2-marriage family.  I do not, however
use my upbringing as an excuse for ANYTHING!  In fact, I use it as a stimulus
to achieve more out of life.  The results thus far include: I am a supervisor
for a contract manufacturing machine shop in Hayward, I own my own home and a
cabin in Tahoe, and have completed 6 years of post-secondary education.  I am
in fact still continuing my education.  
     While I don't look for any recognition for anything I do... for the
benefit of those who have not met me, I will tell you that I have gone out of
my way to pick up people for a party, returned them home (or others who didn't
have a ride...), payed for some to go to a party, helped with setting up
and/or tearing down at a party, and I've never... ever!  tried to "pick up" on
anybody at a party.  I feel I contribute positively to the scene which has
shown me such a feeling of belonging, but as I type this post, I'm wondering
if my being involved in the scene is a bad thing because I do not want to
bring any negativity into it.  (My sister always told me I'm too sensitive for
my own good... but I've shed tears over this whole drama... and I'm really
asking for some advice on how to deal with it.  In short, I guess I'm putting
it into your hands.  So please advise).
Thank you in advance for your suggestions...
Peace. Out.
~Michael

Hey Mike,

Eventhough I heard all of this, reading it and thinking about it a
second time made me think of the situation more. Bro you have my full
support.... some people dwell on the past and thrive on making others
uneasy in an area that they are sharing. She obviously has some problems
that she needs to take care of and the way she is treating you is
completely uncalled for. I think her age may have another affect, she
hasn't lived and learned enough to understand herself. It's kinda sad
that she would resort to these kinds of childish games and that really
dissapoints me that anyone would act that way... I think she needs to
move on and live her life instead of trying to make you feel any nervous
feelings about being in a place with her. Eventhough I've only known you
for a little over 2 months now, you are a great friend to me and I know
for a fact that you don't deserve to be treated this way by ANYONE, and
I know it's not something you can really just forget about and let be
because it would bother me too. In time hopefully she will grow out of
this childish behavior...... And I'm here if ya ever need me bro. See ya
at Vibration : )

GaBbeRheAd,

Mike,

Man I feel for you, I really do.  But PLEASE do not even think of dropping out
of the scene because of of someone else.  I know we don't know eachother but
just from reading your letter you sound like a really cool person with alot of
positive energy to contribute.  Speaking as a once very immature girl myself i
can tell you that this girl is just playing stupid games due to some bad
feelings that she's experiencing from this whole situation.  Maybe she wanted
you to chase after her or some stupid shit like that but you didn't so now
she's just tring to make your life a living hell.  Whatever the case may be
she is in need of some serious help.  My sugestion would be to just confront
her and try and resolve this manner in a civilized fashion, instead of just
trying to ignore the situatuion by leaving the scene, because beleive me your
positive energy will surely be missed by all those who love you and all those
out there waiting to feel you love and positive energy.  So please try not to
let this situation get you too down but rather face it head on, who knows
maybe you guys can become friends?!!

-L.M.

INTENSE 'FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS' SCREENING HAD SOME IN
AUDIENCE LOOKING FOR EXIT

UNIVERSAL sneaked its movie FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS Tuesday
night in North Hollywood. Being described as "one of the most bizarre
films ever made," the Terry Gilliam project based on a Hunter Thompson
took them to hell and didn't let them come back during its 2 hour
screening.

"I got sick afterwards," one attendee told the DRUDGE REPORT. "Like
they laced my popcorn with angel dust or something."

Thompson's 1971 fuss-novel hits the screen after literally 25 years in
development and 17 different scripts. Names like Nicholson, Scorsese,
John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd have been attached over the years. The
story follows the adventures of a ROLLING STONE magazine writer
[Johnny Depp] who is sent to Las Vegas to cover a Narcotics
Enforcement convention. Dark Comedy.

No sex, very little violence, it was scenes of graphic drug-tripping
-- scenes that make the TRAINSPOTTING boys look like aspirin chewers
-- that shocked the crowd and had some looking for exit.

One scene that goes down in a Casino has Depp hallucinating lizards.

The 10 minute scene comes early in the film and sets tone. "He's in
this Casino and all of a sudden every one in it starts to turn into
creepy lizard-like creatures," describes a viewer. "Very disturbing...
wacky."

Depp smokes a cigarillo throughout the film making his continuous drug
rants even more over the top, at times reducing him to nothing more
than a mumble. "Whenthegoinggetsweird, t h e weird turn pro," or
something like that. Depp acts out ether binges, coke tokes, LSD
attacks with surprising ease. Camera effects simulate the highs for
the viewer.

One extended exchange between Depp and his attorney, who is tripping
out hard in a bathtub, was so intense and disturbing that several in
the screening audience walked out of the theater. [More than a dozen
found exit during the film, according to one estimate.]

The drink and drug road trip of writer Depp and his attorney is set
for release in late May. Just how a new generation will relate to
Thompson's "Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream" is an
open question at UNIVERSAL. One executive hints that Depp's Hawaiian
shirt may become a fashion trend. The movie's soundtrack, said to
feature 70's lounge, may also start something.

Hey Mike, if I were you, I wouldn't worry about a damn thing.  This girl
obviously is very insecure with herself or something she has done and
therefore has to try and make you have a hard time for it.  She's
obviously more immature than anybody could imagine so all you have to do
is say, "Fuck it, it's her problem that she's making for herself.  If she
wants me to become as low as her, she'll be waiting for a long time
'cause I'm not about to do that."  You see, she is very immature 'cause
she knows she has done something wrong and in order for her to accept
herself, she has to try and make somebody else to do something wrong so
she can feel better about herself.  I guess you can say that she's one of
them sheep that feels wrong and bad if she does something that everybody
else isn't doing.  She has no thoughts or her own and therefore shouldn't
be worried about.  I know you're a very cool guy and because of that, you
shouldn't have anything to worry about.

Later bro........those glasses you gave me are fucking dope.

VW certainly has done their research to target their audience.

The songs I've recognized in ads:

Orb - Little Fluffy Clouds
Stereolab - Parsec
Spiritualized - Ladies & gentlemen we are floating in space
	(which caused a minor flashback last night!)

And another song I don't recognize.

What is up with that?  The Stereolab and Spiritualized songs
are relatively new, which makes me wonder if they had these
deals lined up even before the albums were released.

Does this scare anyone else at all, just a little bit?

Steve.

 a lot of music works this way with the film & tv industry.  if you watch
The Saint, which came out well over a year ago, there's a scene in the
train station where a 3-second cut of that Daft Punk hit is playing  verrry
quietly in the background.    i don't know when the album was released in
the US, but it was a long time between the time the film came out and radio
started playing the song.

also, remember that a lot of stuff is released overseas a long time before
american culture catches it.  an example is how  Macarena  was a hit in
Mexico & South America like 5 or 6 years before it  revolutionalized
drunken sports revelry in the States.

I'm not sure if they're also trying to get the queer consumer but I was in
the Castro when this bug with a dealership sign on the side pulls into 18th
& Castro. He stops I the middle of the intersection, gets out and waves to
non-existent crowds.

Subject:	VW is so freaking hip . . .

VW certainly has done their research to target their audience.

The songs I've recognized in ads:

Orb - Little Fluffy Clouds
Stereolab - Parsec
Spiritualized - Ladies & gentlemen we are floating in space
	(which caused a minor flashback last night!)

And another song I don't recognize.

What is up with that?  The Stereolab and Spiritualized songs
are relatively new, which makes me wonder if they had these
deals lined up even before the albums were released.

Does this scare anyone else at all, just a little bit?

Steve.

I'll be spinning this friday at the society 1 year.  There is a REALLY
good line-up set for this party and everyone will be playing 2 hour
sets.  I'm not sure if the line-up is supposed to be a surprise or
not..so i won't give the rest of it away.  But, from what i understand
this is going to be a kick-ass party in an unbelievable location. 
Wait til u see what they have in store.

OOooooooooooooooooooh!  I can't funkin' wait for this movie to come out.  
This was such a great book.  I finished reading just as we were driving 
into Las Vegas in a rented convertible at sunset...however I was with my 
dad and we were looking at colleges (boring).  But Hunter Thompson is 
such a wacky fun guy.  I've read about parties at his cabin in COlorado.  

Plus, gotta see this lizard scene...Once, on my seventeenth birthday, my 
friends and I skipped school and spent the day in a park (in Boulder 
CO).  All day.  Morn to dusk. Watched the clouds and listened to Led 
Zeppelin for 9 hours.  'Somehow', I forgot to go to work that day too. 
Parents were worried.  I finally called, and Pop came to pick me up.  I 
opened the door of the Camry (which had no wheels-- rather, it was 
levitating like Luke's landspeeder (?) vehicle in the first Star Wars), 
looked in, and saw that my dad was a Lizard.  His forked tongue kept 
flicking out when he spoke.  I sat on the far edge of the seat as we 
flew home. 

Can't wait to see this funkin' movie!  Yeee-haw! 

Nathan

Hi Michael!  
	You know, hearing you so worried and distraught over some gal who 
doesn't have even the most basic human respect for you really makes me 
sad...you do not deserve this! I'm sure everyone else who knows you will 
agree that you are an exceptional person -- there is *nothing* wrong 
with your behavior, and you have shown nothing but kindness and 
consideration for her feelings....now, i know that i've never met this 
chick, so it's hard to say what's going on inside her head, but there 
actually *are* people out there who seem to enjoy *creating* drama in 
their lives.  Perhaps this is her way of garnering attention from her 
friends or making herself seem important, like you are some stalker 
(which you are NOT) who just won't leave her alone? I mean, really -- I 
was at Bionic, and that place was a MADHOUSE -- way too crowded & hot -- 
and it seems to me like it would take a *lot* of effort to follow you 
around and make your night miserable!  so obviously this girlie has 
nothing better or more useful to do with her time than create situations 
which make you uncomfortable -- a very sad thing, indeed....I know it's 
hard to do this, but continuing with your kindness is the best thing you 
can do.  And staying out of her path as much as possible, tho that might 
be hard cuz we all seem to go to the same parties! :D  She's looking for 
a reaction and you're doing the most sensible thing by not giving her 
one -- you're smarter and better than all this nonsense!  
(and you're hella funny too :)

Don't let someone else's excuse for attention divert you from the fact 
that you are a super person!! 

luv n hugs,
natasha

A company called Happy Kids, Inc. just filed to go public.  

(but it's a clothing line. Ok, so I thought it was funny.)  

Vlad, let me take FGE public!  Or Harmony?  Who here has got a rave crew 
system that can be franchised?  We'll write up a business plan, throw in 
a few forecasts, get an auditor to sign off on the books, and be rich 
before the ink dries.

OK, so I get that Mike/Dsfunshnl requested some advice, and that you are
his friend and are trying to support him, and I think it's great that you
are doing that.

I caution you, though, about making statements like the one quoted above.
You really have no idea what is going on in this girl's head.  How do you
know that "she knows she has done something wrong"?  Perhaps she thinks
that Mike/Dsfunshnl is in the wrong and that she is entirely right.  It's
possible that she had a conversation with her friends that is almost
identical to the one that is going on here.  She says: "Mike/Dsfunshnl is
doing something I don't like."  Her friends say: "Yup, he's wrong, and
we'll side with you because you're our friend."  And the result is the
behavior that Mike/Dsfunshnl described.

If the girl thinks that she is right, then you saying that the girl is
wrong only exacerbates the situation because you're setting up
Mike/Dsfunshnl and his friends to start thinking in a way that isn't in
agreement with the actual situation.  She feels the way she feels, and
thinking that she is  wrong for feeling that way is like thinking that the
earth is wrong for having earthquakes.  Her friends are doing what they're
doing because they think they are supporting her, and I bet that they all
think they are doing the right thing.

I'm not saying that I think that what the girl or her friends are doing is
right, and I'm not saying that you need to think that it's right either.
But if you get that they think that they are right as much as you think you
are right, then you may be able to gain more insight into the situation
than if you just assume that they are wrong and are a bunch of mindless
sheep.

	There's other music besides Electronic? Hehe.. Seriously though... I've
been listening to electronic music for about 6 years now. My music
collection contains nothin' but techno. I don't have anything against other
types of music (well, maybe the spice girls 8-), I think I just always
prefer listening to electronica.... Wether it be trip-hop or hard trance,
I'm always up for it... I might like one or two commercial songs here and
there... but that's about it.

Groups I like...

	Beastie Boys
	Bran Van 3000 (Some of it)
	Sara McGlauklin (I know I spelt her name wrong but have no idea how 8-)
	Tori Amos

I have found myself in this situation multiple times it seems in my youth
on both sides of the fence.  And because of my youth probably is why I
allowed myself to become caught up in the drama regardless of the side I
was on.  I had not experienced anything such as this again until recently
in the rave scene.  Which might *possibly* be explained by the fact that I
had not been around the younger set (21 and under) in quite a while.  When
I did recently find myself in this similiar though not nearly so aggressive
situation, my first reaction was to fall into the drama and be effected by
the evil eye stares, etc.  After a couple of incidences, I realized that I
was falling for the trap of these kind of games and was no better myself in
doing so.  I was no longer an immature child and I wasn't about to start
acting like one.  The very next party that I saw this person at when I
happened to walk by them I treated them just like I would anyone else I
knew in the scene.  I smiled a big genuine smile, said hello, and gave them
a hug, made a little small talk and went on about my partying.  This
completely disfused the situation from that point forward.  We now are
completely amicable whenever we see each other and in time when all wounds
are completely healed and scars gone, we may be friends.  

The point is she wants to get a reaction out of you.  She was obviously
very hurt by this break up and at the very least it made her feel insecure
or like something was wrong with her.   By playing these kind of games she
can make herself feel better about the pain of the break up and feel more
secure about herself.  When you avoid her looks across the dancefloor,
leave the room when she comes in, don't say hello when she walks by, etc.,
you are feeding her right into her games.  These kind of reactions appear
to her like you are more insecure in yourself than she is and that she is
succeeding in hurting you like you did to her.  That is exactly what helps
her to feel better temporarily.  Eventually as the wounds naturally heal
and she moves on with her life (which through past experience I've seen
take as long as a year or two) this behavior by her would fade away.

The fast cure then is if you are not truly hurt by her and you are not
insecure about yourself than stop acting like it and fuelling her fire.  If
you see her givving you the evil eye across the dancefloor smile and wave. 
When you walk by her at a party say hello, you do know her, don't you? 
Don't you normally say hi to people you know as you walk by them?  Stop
treating her like your ex-girlfriend and start treating her the same as you
would any other friendly aquaintance.  Though I don't know you personally,
you seem like a nice, friendly, sensitive guy.  Get over your
uncertainties, Stop letting her get to you, Get on with your life, and
Treat her with the same genuine warmth you would offer any Joe Schmoe in
your life.  In addition to being able to be comfortable and relax at
parties, I think you will find that her wounds will heal much faster as
well.

Kill 'em with kindness 'cause it's hard to hate a warm,fuzzy teddy bear.

Nathan,   Didn't you know... FGE is already a Public company.   Every person
that has supported FGE is a stockholder, and our pre sale tickets are our
stock certificates, which pay out dividends.  And all the events are open to
the public, were ALL are welcome to come in and enjoy.    The next stock
holders meeting is this friday.   For info call 415-263-0483.      Keep it
real...   Vlad

Right on I couldn't have said it any better. That's so true. Micheal you're
definately one of the kinder people I've run into. Don't sweat it, some
people
will never groove. Secure people and insecure people don't mix.

Positivity,

JOHN CARMAN on TELEVISION -- `Teletubbies' Is Here -- Be Very Afraid 
     JOHN CARMAN
     Monday, April 6, 1998 
     1998 San Francisco Chronicle 

     URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/04/06/DD91651.DTL 

     Eh-oh! ``Teletubbies'' begins its assault on the plush-toy market 
today. The weekday kiddie show, imported
     from Britain, begins on PBS (9:30 a.m. on Channel 9), and Hasbro is 
ready. Soon the properly outfitted toddler
     will probably have bright-colored terry cloth pajamas and be within 
arm's reach of Teletubby replicas -- Tinky
     Winky, Laa-Laa, Dipsy and Po. 

     And a few nominal adults will probably be drooling and gurgling 
too. 

     It won't just be the plush toys. These Teletubbies are going to 
grind Barney the purple dinosaur into Barney bits.
     They're going to spawn Web sites bristling with Teletubby arcana. I 
wouldn't even rule out the prospect of
     religious cults. 

     Why do the Teletubbies have those blinking, unformed fetal faces? 
How about the little TV screens implanted in
     their bellies? What's the periscope-control mechanism in 
Teletubbyland? How about the mysterious pinwheel
     that radiates astral sparks -- or are they truly magic spores? I 
don't even want to think about the strange sun that
     shines over Teletubbyland. The sun encircles the face of a giggling 
baby. Bizarre things happen. The baby
     giggles. 

     In fact, I find ``Teletubbies'' downright frightening, for three 
reasons. 

     First, this is a TV show for 1-year-olds. It's a show for infants 
who will have no conscious memory of it. With
     its constant repetition, deliberate incoherence and bright visual 
style that evokes anyone's vaguest, earliest sense
     of springtime and Easter, ``Teletubbies'' presumably is exactly 
what infants want. If anyone understands the
     psychodynamics of infancy. 

     I don't care so much about all of that. What's scary to me is the 
fact that when the intended audience outgrows
     ``Teletubbies,'' it moves on up to ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.'' 
Now we actually have a preparatory TV
     show for Mr. Rogers. 

     Second, there are disturbing reports that when ``Teletubbies'' made 
its splash in England a year ago, certain
     noninfants there started combining the TV show with recreational 
drugs. 

     Think about that. I'm guessing that the only reason anyone would 
drop, say, acid tabs in the first place is to
     experience hallucinations that would look exactly like 
``Teletubbies.'' 

     The show is an immersion in thick green grass, buttery daisies, 
splotches of lavender, live bunnies strewn here
     and there on the landscape, and the four Teletubbies, whose 
movements and speech are devoid of rhyme and
     reason. 

     So why would anyone be dumb enough to do drugs and watch 
``Teletubbies''? It would be redundant. It
     reminds me of Bobcat Goldthwait's old line about Elvis Presley. He 
wondered why Elvis needed drugs when,
     with his money, he could hire midgets to perform hallucinations. 

     Third, ``Teletubbies'' is just plain creepy, and no less so for its 
surface gentleness. A colleague watched the
     review tape and had the sharpest observation yet about the show: 
``I find it strangely soothing,'' she said. With
     equal emphasis on both words. 

     I'll tell you something that happened on the tape. Po, the littlest 
Teletubby, comes across a flagpole sporting an
     aqua flag with an odd serpentine pattern on it. Po and Tinky Winky 
march up and down hills with this discovery,
     and between trees. Then they march it into the Teletubby hut, a 
cavelike dwelling that squats on the verdant
     Tubbyscape. 

     The flag is snapping above the hut, and all four Teletubbies are 
laughing and enjoying their good fortune, when
     the flag inexplicably vanishes. Zap, it's gone. Cut to the sun 
above, with its baby's face smiling slurpily. 

     Soon the narrator intones, ``The sun is setting in the sky, 
Teletubbies say goodbye.'' That's it; some giggling and
     commotion, and the show is over. 

     What happened to the flag, and what the hell was that all about? 
Just a little Teleglitch on the face of creation, or
     something meaningful? 

     Perhaps we are teaching 'em young. The great pinwheel spins, the 
sun laughs and poof, we're once again the
     victim of some incomprehensible cosmic joke.

Hey crazycats,

Hey guys just wanted to let everyone know that I will be coming down to San
Fran from Vancouver this Thursday and will be staying for 5 days.  Anyone
who could offer me some insight on where to go, what parties to check out or
anything of interest it would be greatly appreciated.  Also if anyone could
offer me a place to crash for a night that would be amazing.  If anyone
would like to meet up with me and show me around or let me tag along to a
party I would totally return the favor if you came up here.  I've never been
to San Fran before and am going alone so any help you crazy kids could offer
would be amazing.  See you all soon

thanks,


Michelle

Not that i really accept bribes or softwarez or anything.

YES, what do you want.  He is in town, I can get a message to him but I can
not give you his number.  He'll be at Audio Impact tonight and he'll be at
EKLEKTIC this week.  Tomorrow he goes to LA for the Vipor Room, but then
back again to SF.  Friday he'll be kicking it at the Justice League.

peace,
dmarie

I've decided (uh oh a decision).. that it's time to collect some new RA
streaming
resources. Here's the ones I know about/visit most often. If people
could
stack this list with cool RA (real audio) or MPEG III (btw where do I
get an
mpegIII encoder: anyone got a decent one?) :

http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/ --> essential mix/ grooverider in the
listening room
(essential mix today is pretty good  like 25 minutes into the set)

http://www.hyperreal.org/music/DJsets/ --> good stuff here sometimes
(I've seen their list and have perused spots. Any gems people found?)

http://www.betalounge.com/archive/
(this is good)

http://www.netmix.com
(Did anyone listen to Laurent Garnier's set a couple months ago? phat)

So that's the mainstream sites I think. I know of a few personal
sites (i.e. catweasle's which I liked and somone from sacramento but
I forget the urls). I hope this list will grow huge. I spend a good deal
of
time online during the day. If you don't want to post send em to me
personally.
Thanks much...

Hey all!

Well, I've gone through that quiz and answered all but the ones that leave
me puzzled.

Here are the ones I have /no clue/ on:

9 20 28 101 121 126 130 137 167 181 183 216

Here are the ones I /know/ the song, but can't think of either the artist
or the song name:

193 196 221


How's everyone else doing?

hello michael,

hmmm... sounds like a messy situation, like most break ups are. i think
one of the hardest things to do when a relationship dissolves is to try
and see things thru the other persons perspective. whatever she is
feeling right now, hurt...stalked... sad... angry is real in her world
and it is the motivating force behing her actions. and likewise with you,
however you are feeling right now has motivated you to ask for advice
from your peers. 

there are several things you could do. but its important to look at what
outcome you want. do you want to be friends with her, acquaintances,
enemies, or indifferent ex lovers?

remember that there were things that attracted you two to "get to know
each other". and try to remember that however she is acting and reacting
right now is her mind and body's way of coping with her feelings. whether
or not it is healthy is something else. 

its the unfortunate thing about the human mind, or maybe society.
sometimes its so easy to remember who and how we've been wronged, but it
seems difficult to remember who and how we've been loved, helped, and
righted. and the really sucky thing is how difficult it is to rise above
the pain,rise above the people who have "wronged" us and deal with things
in a "mature" and healthy manner. and maybe even more difficult is to
reach out our hand and try to help them rise above the pain. but doing so
feels much better in the heart and soul. some say revenge is sweet, i say
its sour, bitter, rotten and ugly. 

karma, to me, is another way of viewing the golden rule "do unto others".
i have a qualm with viewing karma as "what comes around goes around".
it's to easy to use this saying as a justification for vindictive
behavior. karma is  how our actions spark other actions and reactions.
it's like a rock that you toss in a tranquil lake, the ripples reach
places of the lake which are hard to imagine. 

so, i dunno, these are some of my opinions gathered thru experience of
being on both sides of the wall. and in the end, whether you two decide
to continue the feud or heal severed ties, a good saying to remember is
"this, too, shall pass". i have met you at sanctuary and think you are a
really cool guy, so i hope things work out for you in a positive light.


-yasmin

p.s. a really good poem to read when you feel like people are being yucky
is maya angelous-"still i rise"

Hey, I think y'all are denigrating the sanctified hallows of sheephood
by saying that a person who acts despicably is a sheep. Sheep are
wonderful, friendly, inquisitive, intelligent, innocent, soft, and
cuddly! I've never met a sheep I didn't like. More people should be
sheep, cuz I've never met a bad sheep, but I've met many bad people.
Acting like the psychobitch described in this thread is very human --
but a good sheep will just say BAAAAAH to such behavior.

And contrary to popular belief, sheep *DO* have thoughts of their own,
but they're so cooperative and wonderful and kind to each other that
you monkeys think they're just running around in a mindless herd. This
is not so. They are infact part of  a greater sheep-mind that
harmonizes their lives from the great beyond, while allowing them to
express their individuality in such a way that doesn't cause conflict.
If only humans were so blessed, but alas, they're just a bunch of
not-so-evolved monkeys that think they're "all that" while still
running around slinging shit at each other.

So, if you want to transcend your meager human existances, please
repeat after me. BAAAAH. I am a sheep. BAAAAAH. 

Now there, Doesn't that feel better already?

Sincerely yours,
	Fluffy. (gosh, it's so hard to type when all you got is hooves!)

For showing up @ our lil event on Saturday.  The numbers were right
(Translation = We didn't lose $$$) and it looked as if everyone had a good
time.  I do want to express thanks for the propriters of the space, the
Sound System, & the DJ's for some wicked-ass sets...  But most importantly:
Thank you, dear raver, for your support.  Without you here, there would be
no reason to throw an event.

And speaking of events, the wait is on the rain....  As soon as that
clears, we'll clear out too... To an undisclosed location for the first of
(Hopefully) a series of free outdoor events.  Just an RAS way of saying
thanks and supporting our local UG scene.

Paz y amor,

Adam, anakin or That Tweeker Behind The Turntables.

When I read _Fear and Loathing_, I generally can't keep myself from
laughing so hard it hurts.

i *do* hope the film captures Thompson's humor and self-focused wit.

who plays the attorney, i wonder?

Regardless, i'm definitely going....

     Hey guys!  A lot of you don't remember me, but for those of you who 
     will, it's me Shawna!  Altho you may better remember me as the Laffin 
     Happy Trip Farmer.  I'm no longer on SFRaves, but I was hoping some of 
     you old skoolers out there might be able to help me with tracking down 
     Moonpup in London.  I will be going there next month, and told him a 
     while back I'd track him down if I got to London.  So, if anybody 
     knows of any information about him, email or snail, if you could pass 
     it along to me that would be very appreciated!  If you have anything, 
     please email me at  
     
     Shawna_McGourty@rld.bofa.com   (including underscore).
     
     
     Thanks!
     And hope you're all doing well!
     
     
     Love

     It was just an average night before going to a party. Anticipation is
high and nothing but time's passing by seems to matter. After arriving in
dowtown Oakland the excitement grows. The location that In-Touch
productions chose for this "Bionic" party looks like a well thought out
location. When calling the info line I was urged to get my pre-sale
tickets early because there was a very limited capacity. This statement
brought my excitement up a notch. It looked like a great party with some
big name dj's and plenty of room to dance. Arriving at the door I started
to realize that everything I thought was wrong. The line was deceptively
short and it looked like not too crowded of a party. I was dead wrong. As
I walked through the door it was only 10'oclock and already the dancefloor
was packed. It was nearly impossible to move around the place and when you
found a nice spot to dance more people came through the door flooding the
floor. By 12 it seemed that there was not an inch of cold wet pavement to
dance on. 70 percent of the people were not even moving just standing
around. The sound system could not handle and tracks with a hint of bass
in them. The speakers sounded like a stock system in a car on full blast.
recieved many , "Get the fuck outa the way." and "Move bitch." The vibe of
this party was horrific. I can understand why people were mad. Nobody
likes being at a party that is hotter than a New York august. No fans or
windows allowed for no airflow and the stench of sweat and smokes. The
Drum'n'Bass room was so packed that it was an adventure to get in far
enough to hear what set the Dj was playing. In the main room DJ's were
made to sound like crap with a system that could not support the beats in
their set. It seemed that almost every dJ shopped at the same record shop
for there was at least 3 records played more than twice. To top it all off
after you are sweating more water than the Salt Lake they charge you 2
dollars for water in a line located at the most inaccesible place in the
whole wherhouse(spell check). I recomend that you never attend another
In-Touch party in your life or never attend your first. In-Touch needs to
learn that there is more to making a party than booking the dj's. The main
reason they exist is because of us. Treating people like caged animals is
no way to thank a bunch of people that just payed for your rent.


               One Love,

                  Goombata

This is exctly what I was trying to warn people of when I stated that I would
not be in attendance of this party due to the fact the promoter for In-Touch,
Mikey, does not care about anything about the kids that come out to support
him, he's just in it for the money.  Why do you think he includes names like
Grand Master Flash and Sugar Hill Gang to his list of performers at his planet
rock parties? It's so he can attract a larger crowd and make more money.
That's why his parties are hella ghetto and everyone I know hates his parties.

Anybody recommend any RA sites with better audio quality and rates
closer to 40K (most seem to be 16-24 K). I wanna see all the cool
things my new 56K modem (USR V-Everything External) and PPP gateway
(www.ugate.com) can do!

Even better would be places w/ MPEG3's of people's mixes. I'd just love
to get my hands on the Betalounge's winter music conference sources in
DAT or MPEG3 format! Even though the RA stuff sounds kinda yucky,
it's still nice to be able to hear all those great DJ's.

PS: I've found that through judicious use of multiband
compression/expansion/eq (combined w/ direct SPDIF digital output of RA
stream from my computer), when piped through my TC Electronic Finalizer
(digital dynamics processor), I can make AM-radio sounding RA sites
(e.g. www.betalounge.com or www.pirate-radio.com)  sound downright
snappy coming out of the Genelec studio monitors! But like they say,
you can't shine  shit and I sure would like some better sounding stuff
with higher bitrates and a stereo image.

You missed the point. I was responding to your question as to why the

Supposedly in New Zealand, there's 25 sheep for every citizen.

See Mike sweetheart...
	Everyone's here to back you up. Don't let this stress you out and hold you
down (and you know, this is coming from personal experience). Maybe we should
charge her for those pictures she got...lol! As I see it, this can't go on for
much longer. Either she'll give up trying because you're such a strong person,
or you and her will actually talk and figure out what the hell is going on. If
neither of these things happen, I'll bust out with my ninja tofu and regulate
;-)
	Sometimes women are such a pain...hehe.
Take it easy ya'll

and lets not forget that back in the day we were spinnin sheeps hair 
long before we was spinnin rekKIDs. And our music came from deep
inside our hearts, not from any of these new fangled techno devices.
and we liked it...

Yes... we got the whole community together and everyone was just
spinning up a storm...then we would all gather round the fire and
partake of grandpas sacred drink and start sewing psychedelic quilts.

I can still remember the thump thump thump
of the looms as we wove our stories and love into the quilts
that we sold to the white man to teach him about peace.

Ok, I've gotta get off this mailing list soon! No offence, but my eyes
cannot take the amount of mail I've been getting. I just thought I'd ask
one more time if anyone has any advice on SanFran clothing stores for a
visiting Vancouverite.  I like funky used clothes. Stylewise, I like
anything strange, some of it could be considered raverish (I call it
comfy), but deep in my heart, I'm a mod, so anything that could fit into
those categories. Please help me! I want to help your economy as best I
can!!!

Hi all.

Does anyone know any good coffee shops or any hang-out spots which open
for 24 hours in downtown SF?
I often come up to SF with friends and go out in the night but always
have difficulty to find a place to kill our time.

Thanks!

Jun

sure, that's not a bad deal if you are distributing them on CD.  that's
one of the great things about mp3 encoding.  i can fit over 8 full
length audio cds onto a single data cd once i rip/encode them.

as a matter of fact, we have an mp3 server at work with a rack of 4G
scsi drives (running FreeBSD) that is packed with stuff.

however, distributing mp3s over the internet isn't exacly net friendly.
but, wasting bandwith is a pet peeve of mine ;-)

Hey Kidz,

I wanted to write this note and send it personally
but after thinking about for a sec. I thought you
might find this story kind of cool.

On Friday I took my good friend Eric snowboarding for
the first time. We experienced some difficulties with
our car but had a good time and made it off the hill
with about 5 hours to spare before the rest of our
party made it up the hill.

I had remembered that Jill (cheerio 80) worked over at 
the Starbucks in Truckee so we decided what the heck
lets call her up and say hola'. Now you have to
understand I have never met Jill and talked to her
once via:e-mail. Without hesitation she said, "stop
by and see me!" so it was off to Starbucks (the ONLY
place to hang out if your in high school and live in
Truckee).

We meet Jill and she says,"I'll take my lunch!" and it
was off to "the King" for some chicken sandwiches. We
instantly clicked, you know those weird instances where
you just meet someone and you feel like you have known
them forever? Well Jill asked her boss to let her
off early and said, "Since you have no-where to go lets
go back to my place and you can kick it and wait for 
your friends." We were super stoked! Her parents took
us in like we were family and we both had a great time
hanging with Jill, messing around on her tables
(junglist DJ's beware) she is just an absolutely
SUPER person!! Mind you we were supposed to be there
a couple of hours and left at like 1 in da' morning
do to lagging raver time. 

I just wanted to thank you Jill, publically for opening
your home to Eric and I. You are a very special person
and if you ever need a place to stay (we got the house
in S.F ;) my home is open to you and your friends. All
because I happend to be on "sfraves". You rock the
house Jill! Come see us when you visit your man ;)

Layne

Hi Rave Friends,

        One of the problems I see with extreme socialism (aka communism) in
which not only the means of production and distribution, but ALL property
is owned by society at large, is illustrated by the common phrase,
"Possession is nine tenths of the law."  Say you want to wear to your next
rave a colorful outfit which is currently in the possession of a big, mean,
professional wrestler who sleeps with an Uzi under his bed.  Are you really
going to be able to just walk into the house where he resides (note: not
*his* house) and take it?  Probably not, unless you're willing to bring a
small army or break in when he's not home.

        If you wanted the outfit badly enough to go to that kind of
trouble, you might be willing to pay some amount of money to him, or to a
third party, such as a sympathetic mutual friend, to obtain the transfer of
the group-owned property in question without going to the trouble of
exercising your legal rights to it directly.

        Of course this is overlooking all kinds of custody and transfer
problems that would obviously arise when multiple individuals wished to use
the same item over a period of time.  Considering how such a system would
actually work makes it seem even more unlikely to me that private property
will ever be abolished on any scale larger than among a small group of
friends or in a limited environment such as a workplace.

        But that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Take away ownership and
sharing no longer carries the same qualities of generosity and kindness.
Instead it brings resentment and guilt, as people take things that others
really don't want to give.

Peace, love & liberty,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

Hey all...
   Some friends and I have been thinking about putting together a party 
for quite awhile, and we finally started doing something about it. We 
have had a few meetings, secured funding, and have a good idea of what 
we want to do. Now all we need is the DJ's. Following is a list of the 
ones we voted on. Anyone with any contacts that could reach these guys 
(or gals! - DRC's Awsome!), please send them along. And just as a 
question, has anyone thought of making a list and posting it on the 
hyperreal site? It sounds like a good idea if it hasn't already been 
done.

(in no particular order)
Doc Martin
Jeno
Simon
Tony
Jerry Bonham 
DJ Doubt
DJ Dan
Donald Glaude
Carlos
Frankie Bones
Sasha - england
Drc
Dutch
Crystal Method

   Now don't feel bad if we didn't mention your name, or a friend of 
yours. We DEFINITLY want any local or upcoming talent to be shot our 
way, so please send Name, Location, Music Type, and Contact to us.
   Thanks everyone for the help. This party is tenativly scheduled for 
the 27th of June, but that is not, NOT, set in stone yet. The name of 
the party will be "Incarnation, the chapter of earth." Please e-mail me 
any questions, comments, or ideas. All are welcome.

Peace and Love,
Dave

I tried to keep track of some bpm's once upon a time, but that endeavor only
lasted 10 minutes.  My ears just tell me what speed the track is relative to
what's playing out on the other turntable.

But I have heard of tools that will do this for you.  Not my bag baby!

there is a nifty piece of software for the mac that i use to identify bpm...i
just send the input to my computer and VOILA! it measures and verifies the
bpm. This works perfectly for 4-on-the-floor beats; more complicated rhythm
structures require a longer sampling time, but it still gets it accurate just
the same.

i found this 'lil program on cnet's webpage, shareware dept.

I use WinBPM which is a very simple and effective little program. can
usually get a solid bpm in about 15 secs. requires manual input, tho.

Hi Gang,

        So Check this out.....  This friday, FGE is throwing down a
small UG in SF.   There will be at least one room ( a second room is
being worked out right now) with dj's Jazz-E, Kevin Kind, Carlos, Ghost,
and Guest DJ Sahid, From Germany, making a stopover on his dj tour,
Dreamers Paradise.     Sound will be by Xtreme Audio, and I candy
Visuals, as well as toons of ligting, banners, and all that other fun
stuff and surprises.

        In addition, there is also a free outdoor FULL MOON after party
(weather permitting) with our friends from the SF House Collective.
Directions to the after party will be given inside the main party.
It's going to be fun night of great grooves, and fun peeps, so I hope
that you can all join in.

        Basically, the admission is going to be very confusing, so i'll
break down all the options... nice and simple like....

Option 1)   The general cover will be $10 with a canned food donation to
Project Open Hand, and the SF Food Bank.

Option 2)   The special cover will be $5 with a canned food donation, if
you have a pre sale ticket stub from any previous FGE parties.

Option 3)   You're gona love this one.....   Come in for FREE with a
canned food donation if you purchase a $20 pre sale ticket for Feel Good
Forever (May 23rd) at the door, and the first 100 people that purchase a
pre sale ticket will receive a copy of Dreamers Paradise by DJ Sahid
from Germany.

        There is a limited capacity on this event, and it will take
place at the Ravatime Hall at the corner of First and Harrison St., in
San Francisco.   All are welcome.   doors will open promptly at 9pm.

for additional info and updates , as well as directions,   call
415-263-0483.

Thanks and Keep it real...   Vlad.

 how much does the pitch control mathmatically
change the bpm? (what does +2 mean? 2%?)

what do the dots lit up by the strobe signify? i've 
had people explain this to me before, but my brain
hasn't been able to  grasp the concept.

you guys can flame me for this but i am going to come out and say it anyways ... why the hell do we have 2 weeklies on monday evenings in san jose now ... i mean the san jose scene does not have enough people to support 2 parties on the same night ... the best way to kill the scene in my opinion is to try to split it ... united we stand a chance ...

as far as i know afterglow started 3 weeks ago before this party and it has been bringing in a good crowd ... AndyW has been in the scene for a while now but i had never heard of miss bethie and her friends until very recently when she started posting a huge amount of BSP about her friend's parties ...

i will let the sfraves crew in the south day decide who they want to support but my full support goes to andyw and afterglow ... and miss bethie a little less bsp and more substance would be appreciated ...

Rudi

Last night was the best night I've had in a long while!
First off, I walk in on some loud jungle blaring through
the speakers.  I look at the screens and they are playing
Star Wars, X, and excerpts from Ghost in the Shell.  
And to top it all off, thye were playing a PSX on the screen!
I was sitting at home playing Dead or Alive, the game that
they were playing, just hours before I came to the club!
Bad ass!  The music was SO good!  Everyone that spun
last night got me moving!  Especially Siphon.  YEAH!  =)
If it's like this every week, you can definitely count me in 
EVERYTIME!  I had so much fun last night!   

Had fun talking to everyone.  It's great to get to know more
and more people in the scene.  AndyW, you spun wonderfully,
you'll have to let me know what you were spinning!  It blew
my mind!   We have to get this picnic thing going!  Megan and
jimg both bugged me about it.  I guess they think I should
organise another, huh?  No problem, I guess, you guys name
the park and I'm there with bells on!  (maybe not bells....  )
I'm up for it, how about you guys?  DjNick!  Man, we have to 
get together sometime!  I met 2 new people last night, Herb
and another cute grrrrlie, but I can't remember her name.  =(
I tried to remember but I was in a daze the whole night.  I had
so much fun!  Thanks again to AndyW, Li, Science, Siphon and
MAK.  You guys kicked my ass!

Jedi666Boy

COMPETITION forces people to perform at their absolute best.  if you've got
two weeklies going down on the same night you can bet they'll each be
grabbing the best talent they can, making the most visually entertaining
flyers they can, putting together the best nightclub atmosphere they
can...just to snag your hard-earned dollars.

even if this isn't happening right now sooner or later one of the clubs is
going to have to up the ante in order to increase their numbers.  

me, i like the idea of a choice.  if one club is getting overly housey,
let's say, and i'm bored with that, it's nice to have another option to
turn to.

If you ask me, which nobody probably did, I cast my
vote for afterglo!  After last night, not much could change
it!  It would take quite a bit of convincing to make me go
to another club that night.  I've always hated the cactus
club but now, fuck all that!  I might be tempted to check
out what I'm missing one night, but I have a feeling that
not much will change my mind!  

afterglo kiX My @$$!!!!

it seems rather easier to simply get a feel for manually beatmatching,
rather than doing it arithmetically.  besides, riding the groove...keeping
your fingers loose yet tight on that mysterious revolving label in the
center, all the while your right hand not knowin' what the left is doing
just goin' crazy on pitch control, smooth slide heading down..."madre de
dios!  i am approaching the dreaded plus 8, o can it be that these records
won't match?"

NO!  somewhere around 7.5 you tentatively lift your shaking,
low-blood-sugar digits from the label, and listen with sweaty, perked-up
ears as the mix screams through the headphones for the murderous
dropped-marble chaos of a beat mismatch (o yah, we in "da biz" call dem
"car crashes" or sumtin like dat).

but it's smooth and clean and o yeah you bring that fader up just like you
was Jeno himself...oh the needle rolls into a break, so CUT THE MIDRANGE,
DROP THE BASS!

now start all over.  and do that for a couple hours.

you got it.. it actually changes the speed of the motor, so if you had it
on 33 RPM, locked on 0 and then move it up to +2 then it's now going
33*1.02=33.66 RPM...

related concept. the dots are spaced so that when the table is locked at 0,
the dot will arrive in front of the strobe just as it flashes, and appear
to stand still. if you speed up the table, dots begin arriving "ahead" of
the flash. to look at it another way, each consecutive dot is beyond the
spot where the previous dot was during the strobe flash. thus they appear
to slowly move off to the side.

the different rows of dots are for 33 or 45 RPM... essentially, this is a
hard-wired physical way to tell if your turntable is calibrated correctly,
and to get visual feedback as you adjust the pitch. i hope this made sense...

I personally would have to say the Gathering--Thats where I'll be going 
atleast. I think you should just base your party on the kinda music that 
you favor, I like hard house/progessive better, and I love all of the 
Choice Production parties, so thats the main reason that I'll be going.
PeaceOut

Much Love

Any one seen those new records with a chip implanted in the
center part? You need a special adapter for the turntable
to read them but they contain lots of info like bpm,track length,
etc that is then displayed on a lcd readout. The chips can be attached
manully to the records you already have and programed with another
little gizmo.

In a message dated 98-04-06 21:28:45 EDT, you write:

<< This is exctly what I was trying to warn people of when I stated that I
would
 not be in attendance of this party due to the fact the promoter for In-Touch,
 Mikey, does not care about anything about the kids that come out to support
 him, he's just in it for the money.  Why do you think he includes names like
 Grand Master Flash and Sugar Hill Gang to his list of performers at his
planet
 rock parties? It's so he can attract a larger crowd and make more money.
 That's why his parties are hella ghetto and everyone I know hates his
parties.
  >>

This is so funny, because I really have mixed feelings about this guy> No..
this is not a trash talk letter, and no you do not have to support In-Touch if
you don't like them.  However, I knew that if I went to one of his parties
that it WOULD be ghetto with a capital G.  So what happened?? I told you all
about Planet Rock.  We had more fun then I've had in AGES!!! and it was
totally unexpected.  Afterwards Mikey even thanked us and gave me and a few of
my friends a group hug  for coming out to his party.  So.. yah.. I knew bionic
would not be good so I didn't want to go (mind you this had nothing to do with
the fact that I was out of town).  So here's someone you can know now that
says... Not all In-TOuch parties are the worst parties in the world.  And YES
I am a hypocrite and talk smack about Planet Crock and Bionic... heheeh so
flame away.  MY 2 cents..

hugs n'stuff,
trice the tekno diva

I have been listening to a few home made mix tapes lately and I found
something in common with several of them that really erked me. I felt as a
listener and a buyer of mix tapes that I would make a suggestion to those
DJ's and any other aspiring DJ's.

My suggestion: please please please fade out the last track on your tape. It
is most painful to my heart my mind and my ears to be really into a track
and to have it cut off right in the middle because it's the end of the tape.
However if the song faded out smoothly at least I would expect the track and
the tape to end and not have a heart attack when it did.

Thanx to those of you who already do this and to those of you who now will

And one more thing RUDI..

	Weren't you the one in the PLUTO hat on Saturday night? Its funny when you talk about SUPPORTING people's parties.  That was also MANNY's party from the Velvet Shop *held at the usual on Thursday nights* And you were all for supporting that.  So what is wrong with me posting yet ANOTHER one of his weeklies or parties? Which is free none the less.. I really am sorry that this has stirred such a fire in you

hey bobbi,

i don't know if i qualify for the catwalk or anything, but i buy a lot
of clothes in the vintage clothing stores around valencia and 16th.  i
see other thriftravers in them as well sometimes.  das pussycat on
16th btwn valencia and guererro has nice stuff, more spendy but
generally under $20.  lots of mod stuff there.  clothes contact on
valencia, btwn 16th and 15th, has clothes by the pound, it's much
cheaper, i got a cool safety-yellow jacket there recently for about
$6.  and theres a few other places within a couple of blocks.  plus
the mission is fun to hang out in, lots of bars, clubs (liquid on 16th
btwn mission and van ness, for instance), scarification studios...
plus you can get indian ice cream at bombay ice cream on valencia btwn
16th and 17th.

gee, i oughtta be a tour guide...

sorry if this is kinda late, but i only have so much time to read sfraves
and write emails at work, but i wanted to say something

i went to the advanced screening for this movie in la last tuesday. i
believe the film is scheduled to be released sometime next november. these
are just some brief thoughts on the screening:

essentially, i hope they fix it in time for release. there are many things
i like about what theyve got so far. for example, johnny depp does a pretty
good raoul duke. his rendition seemed very cartoony, reminded me a lot of
the ralph steadman drawings

the first half covering the dirt bike races was quite good

in the second half, about the dea's convention, i feel the director took
too much of a liberty rearranging things a little bit. it made it difficult
to stay focused on the story. they change the ending slightly too

they definitely do their best to try and shock the audience as best as they
can. after a while, it gets a little bit too much. in my opinion, it
downplayed a little bit the big message i got from the book, which is: this
is what we believed in the 60s, and this is what we are left with now

i dont remember who played dr gonzo, but i never really liked his character
in the book anyway and so i didnt really like the way the character was
handled in the movie

i believe november is the date to look out for as far as a release goes

anyway, have a good day everyone, and ill see you this saturday at
frequency 8!

joe

I apologize, I don't think the two posts I posted before my last post that showed up made it to the list. My mail server has been acting whacky, and I wanted to make sure that I got my thing in.

RUDI, I apologize that you feel the way you do, and that it was such a problem about the BSP I posted about the Monday nite weekly.. I was not aware that Afterglo was a Monday night party in San Jose.  Also, the party TOP SHELF, is thrown by the same person who throws VelvetShop on Thursday nights and also The GREEN GORILLA LOUNGE this past weekend... Which is Manny.  

I am sorry that it was such an ordeal for me to post what was going on, but I am not trying to create COMPETITION.  I was just INFORMING people of the party, and not knowing that Afterglo was on the same night, ALSO afterglo has a little advantage over Top Shelf, its an actual 18+ party in SJ, not a 21+.  

Once again I am sorry, but I also thank Layne, I do have the right to post BSP's. This list is to INFORM of parties not just have rave discussions.  I am on 10 different mailing lists, so it is hard for me to keep up with posting all the time, but when I think of something or something comes up, I do post it.  Getting 400 emails a day is a little crazy, and you can lose your self in it sometimes.  

Sorry for any problems I have caused, but I really don't see what the big deal is.

I've gotta side with Rudi on this issue.

I don't think Rudi was trying to flame you for posting BSP's or anything
like that, or because your event is on the same night as afterglow.

But the facts are simple:  We'd all like to foster a scene in SJ.  But,
assuming that there are only a limited number of people to support that
scene, both events, when scheduled for the same night, are hurt.

Say that on any given Monday night, there are only 100 ravers that decide
to go out.  20 might go to Top Shelf, 80 go to Afterglow.  The managers of
whatever club Top Shelf is get bummed, because they aren't making any
money, because there are only 20 people there...so they start to wonder if
they should even be open on Mondays, or maybe give that timeslot to some
other event.   The managers of the Cactus Club, on the other hand,  are
more satisfied, because they have more business.

Or vice versa.

Even in a perfect world, if 50 people go to one and 50 go to the other,
from the managers' POV, that's not alot of heads, and they don't make much
profit.

It's supply and demand.  True, having the option to go to either is nice,
but let's face it, unless both places get packed and stay packed, one or
the other is going to be cancelled, because the clubs' owners won't be
feeling like they're making enough profit to stay open.

On the other hand, if Afterglow is on Mondays, and Top Shelf is on some
other night, then those 100 people will most likely ALL go to one, and
then ALL go to the other.  Mangers everywhere are happy, because their
clubs are full.

Just a thought,

-jimg

On a Technics SL1200mk2 that's not quite true. All the dots work the same
for 33 and 45. There are four sets of dots: +6%, +3.3%, 0, and -3.3%.
You're right of course, they're very usefull fo checking calbration. Great,

here i go playing tour guide again...

on mason st, right up from the youth hostel (downhill from post) are a
bunch of 24 hour diners i really like.  the pinecrest is where this
waitress got shot last year, made all the papers.  given the service
we got there, i'm not surprised, but it is pretty diner-ific.  i like
one of the other places better, it's 1/2 block downhill, this 50's
lookin place w/checkered floors and lotsa chrome.  it's pretty cool,
for instance there's nothing but 50's and early 60's stuff on the cd
jukebox, plus they make killer malted shakes, and a great breakfast
any time of day.  plus you see a real wide variety of people there at
3am, tourists, ravers, asian gangsta kids, businessmen, hookers...

the one a few doors downhill from it is bigger, but not as good.  look
for the one with the (much) smaller shopfront w/the grill in plain
sight and the 50's choons piped out onto the street...

I apologize that you feel that way about my BSP, but actually its a FREE party thrown by Manny (M3) from the Velvet Shop and he has been around for a long time.  I am not creating competition JUST informing people of what is going on.  Maybe afterglo started before TOP SHELF, but Top Shelf isn't there to make any money at all either, so it isn't really that big of a deal.  Anyway, I once again apologize that you feel that way, but I think I have the freedom to post things such as BSP's on this list if I want too... This list is to INFORM people as well as discuss things in the scene.

i agree that we should be trying to create togther instead of competing
against each other, but that would be like asking martin not to throw a
gathering because vlad is throwing a fge. sometimes our own agendas don't
quite mesh with those of others. we need to stop trying to find what is
wrong with each situation and start seeing the good in it all. think about
this. when i left san jose in october 97, there was no 18+ dance night at
least not the kind of dancing that i wanted to do. there are plenty of 21+
weeklies and i am sure they aren't going to lack for support. we need to
support 18+ weeklies, so that they keep happening. i give mad props to the
afterglo kids for all the hard work that they are doing.

i could be wrong, but arent many of the bigger RA sites 
bandwidth-negotiated?  meaning, the better connection you 
have the better audio freq range you get?

AFTERGLO :) 
well i had 3 hours wack sleep this morning but it was well worth it..

never before have i seen a buncha guys have so much fun throwing their own
weekly -- YEAH!!! PROPS to the boys! i found myself a new home for monday
nights, even though it won't always be jungle (sniff) the crowd is plush
and vibey and well, how can i resist...
the jungle was great, a bit alcohol-influenced near the end *ahem* NOAH
YOU ROCK which just made the night taht much more fun! the crowd too, i
was surprised there are so many SoBay junglists out there... PROPA !!!!
:))
got there early, left late and danced the majority of the night, running
into SFRavers new and oldz alike (if i named you all it'd be like rollcall
or something, and i KNOW i'd be mispronouncing your names) but dear lord
be nice to me, i was tipsy. and my head couldn't get off that dancefloor,e
ven though i sat it out a bit..
	SOOPER PROPS for AndyW's RAGGA and oldskoolin jumpup tracks he was
throwin ddown in the beginning, yeah thats what it is he was playin btw :)
even origin unkown's 31 seconds YEAH makin a comeback (once again).. 
	and SCIENCE's LOVELY LOVELY set with his diverse selection that
flows like it's all one song..
	and HAK/THAD who just kicks in all aspects, his style just blows
my mind straight *UP* (you had me running back in the club all night
evertime i just lit a cigarette goin *DAMN! again?*) 
	and of course SIPHON for his inceredibly enthusiastic,
smile-abundant set that kept everyone nutting and screamin and beggin for
more.. nice scratchin, brotha ;))

i have to say, i saw alot of people i haven't seen in ages and it FELT
GOOD to see you all, and meet you all, and hang with people i saw in
recent times as well.. and if you wonder who i was, i was wearin a purple
shirt and really short blonde hair..
*DINK*
see you all at afterglo next week! and if you miss it, you're missin OUT
:) 
+ these guys are just tryin to give us somethin to do on a monady night,
$3 at the door $5 for 18+ doesn't make for a profit, i don't think... just
representin the south bay the way they can do it best.. and they DO DO IT
THE BEST!!!!  TRUE THAT!!!!!!!!
:)))

Subject: more rave documentary help
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi. it's me again, and I need more help.  I want to structure the documentary
into little chapters or sections, each dealing with various aspects of raving.
seems logical, right?  I also have to keep in mind who the audience is going
to be: people who don't know about raves or think they do, based on nasty
little
one-sided things like the 20/20 special.  In other words, I want to define or
explain terms and other things and in doing so, hopefully show a balanced
view of what the rave scene is.

And as I am new to raving, I thought I'd seek advice from you more experienced
people. what aspects of raving do you think should be defined or presented?
For example, I'm considering sections like massive vs. underground, candy
raver/
candied up, music (to include DJs, trainwrecking, types of music, etc.),
fashion,
drugs.....
suggestions?

Basically, assume you have to explain raving to someone who doesn't know.
what are the major areas you would outline?  don't be afraid to gimme both
good and bad things, cause I do want to show ALL of it.

thanks to everybody out there. I hope to meet you all one day.

much love 
& besitos!
marie

inquiring minds want to know...

1. what is a compressor?
2. anyone have any helpful hints for how to program phat beats on a drum
machine or keyboard? 
3. is it possible to integrate an accoustic piano (real piano) into
electro music or would you have to use the sampled sounds on a keyboard?
or are there keyboards that have the touch sensitivity of a real piano?
4. (bonus ?) how many days are there in a year : P

I was too ragged last week to post my reviews of parties and stuff so I
am going to do a SHORT series of posts reviewing everything i did last
week with emphasis on the highlights(I know you don't want all of the
gorry details ;D)

Day 1:
After getting off of work and going to a friends sorority bbq (oh the fun
=P) I pick up a bunch of folks (fit 6 FULL siz peeps in a Camry) and went
to Tranceforce. Definite a dope party. Highlights include the downstairs
room especially w/ Michael Liu, and MystrE's set upstairs. I usually like
DRC's set's but that night I just couldn't get into it. Also the group
hug and the ever present SLO-tribe representin'. 

Day 2:
Spent the day helping ~e~l~e~n~a~ moving into her new apartment with guy
and Byron and some of her other frenz. Then dealt with the Wells Fargo
not clearing my check because of system problems drama. did some rekkid
shopping at Crazy Eddie's on telegraph (if you got patience you can find
some cool rekkids there) then drove up to Terri's party in Sac with Byron
and danced the night away, while drinkin' her home made guarrana punch.

Day 3:
After an hour and a half of sleep drove back home from Terri's and went
to T&J Factory and picked up a few nice Trance Compilations. Then drove
down with Feathr333 to Nick's Sunday Sanctuary and Played on his tables
for a few hours. As more people showed up i hung out and grubbed and
listened to others spin like vets(Nick, Derek, and Geoff) and other try
out the tables for the first time (Minh) This weeklie is turning out to
be a neccessary part of my week in order to wind down and meet more
folks. Props to Nick, his rommies and the regulars.

Stay Tuned for more brief reviews to come

MooK<><

Its true we all love each other up here and we never fight
or even say bad things about each other...well one time
someone told someone that they didnt think something they had posted was very nice 
but that blew over pretty quick.
About the only time we get cranky and mean is when those
people from down south try to come up here and mess with us.
 
Peace and love and acceptence and tolerance to all...except those
southerners that just want to come say mean intolerant things  =)

As a member of SoCal-Raves I gotta pipe up here.  :)

Yeah, SoCal is having some real problems right now...  Things have been 
on a downward slide for the last couple of months.  I dunno if it's the 
weather, the lack of good stuff to do or what.  But for the most part 
it's a fun list.  There's a lot of drama, but there's a lot of drama in 
_everything_ in SoCal! :D  

I love both lists. :)

So since there is so much drama maybe we could start our
own raver sitcom. Do you think american tv is ready for a raver
soap opera or sitcom?
It could be a perfect hollywood project...right?   =)

what would we call it?

As the ravers spin?

raves of our lives?

One life to rave?

All my raves?

any other suggestions?

I was going to use a drum machine to determine bpms. A friend of mine
did this and he said it helped alot. Where did you get that winbpm thang?
Do you tap the key to beat? I've got one of those somewhere. I'm realising
now however that matching beats is just the entry to matching chords, breaks
and pauses. Wow this just keeps getting more and more interesting.

A compressor reduces the dynamic range, by the compressionratio, of any
program material you feed into its inputs.  Most
compressors also include attack and release envelope controls
to flatten or smooth out the peaks or transient program material.

Good compressors offer a "happy medium" effect of flattening the
source material's dynamic range while retaining the integrity of
the overall mix, especially in the mid and high frequence ranges.

Dramatic amounts of compression can produce breathing or
pumping effects which most accoustic engineers will keep to a
minimum but which can produce some very interesting artifacts
for experimental or techno producers.

Oh and there are 365 days in most years, however,
every fourth year there is a leap year which has 366 days.

Jen you good missy nub nubbin

inquiring minds want to know...

1. what is a compressor?
2. anyone have any helpful hints for how to program phat beats on a drum
machine or keyboard? 
3. is it possible to integrate an accoustic piano (real piano) into
electro music or would you have to use the sampled sounds on a keyboard?
or are there keyboards that have the touch sensitivity of a real piano?
4. (bonus ?) how many days are there in a year : P

Hey, I'm a long time socaler who can see your point, but I must say 
something:

Socal is only as good as its participants make it.  Our whole community 
is based on the idea of doing it yourself and that goes for the list, 
too.  The list is very symbolic of the scene down here right now.  If 
Elevation had gone off, you would see a very different list right now.  
But, since it didn't, people are crabby.

Socal has a certain something that SF lacks.  And SF most certainly has 
something Socal lacks.  That's what makes them special and unique.  Try 
saving your own before running to a new scene and discarding the old 
one.  Socal has a LOT to offer.

I'm so thrilled that someone wants to make an honest
documentary about an undefinable group of childeren
that stay out all night getting high in confined spacez
dancing uncontrolably non stop for hourz in front of
wallz of 25 inch subz blasting distorted and boisterous
muzic while security teamz and cops watch with amazement.

AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm assuming this iz for a film,sooooostarthere
ifitsnotforafilmthenillpostanewmessagewithanideaforabookokay?

herez what you do:
First break your project down into two parts...
Control and Out of...
the first part should have an intro that describez ravez.
Not some webster dictionary collegiate edition educated 
guess making pocket protecter wearing hypothesis forming
pencil necked geek saying,"A rave iz defined az a loud
or boisterous party characterized by its unorganized
organization," in some annoying nazal voice...
You should get yourself a party kid, (^_^).oO(I'm a party kid)
and have them be either the host or have them inroduce
themselvez at the beginning and narrate the film...
After the descriptive introduction, break off into different 
sectionz...
 Introduction:I've never been to a party and don't know where
they are thrown at but I want to go to 1
 Selection:Deciding where to go, picking good partiez
and not falling for over advertized bunk-rave flierz
(Planetrock98,Tribal Massive97,Bigfloor97)
 Preparation:How and where to go about getting
tix b4 the nite of the show, what to bring 
 Appearancez:How should I dress, whats everyone gonna be 
wearing
 Arrival:what to expect in your first few mins inside
 Showtime:After every1 takes their medication
 Clozing:Last set of the night,possible afterparty
 Crash:Vizual demonstration of the E-ffects of expending
large amounts of N-rgy for X-tended periodz of time
 Aftermath:Returning to your normal routine after a never
again to be repeated or forgotten evening.

Part 1 iz called 'Control' right? and it should cover 
every aspect of a rave that a first timer should know about .
Part 2 iz called 'Out of...'right? and it should cover
every negative aspect of compulsive party behaviour,
or addiction to the lifestyle az I like to think of it.
This part can be introed w/something generic like
"We learned that ravez are not bad but bad thingz do happen
inside of one in 'Control'. Well now we'll go over the 
side effects and negative aspects of party life..."cheezier
and cheezier, so on and so on...
Then Break your sectionz down into something like
 Addiction:Can't seem to stop going to partiez
 Love of the life:Just cause the music stops doesn't mean
that I am...(in reference to vitaminz A and Cr and E)
 Ouch:Effects of Dancing for 8 hourz non stop without
going pee or taking the time to drink some water
 Reality Check:When Party kidz realize that raves are for
muzic love and dancing, not the drugz...
And then Sign off....
Short little conclusion by the party kid(Me)(^_^).oO(pleazzze!!!)
Short little clozing statement from the director(U)
Roll the credits
How hard iz that?
SotheresmyideaandIhopeyoulikeditcauzeIcantcomeupwithanythingelse!
==
The Cali 1 who'z AlwayzSpun,
livin life and havin fun...
Gettin high late at night,
Alwayz rollin through hiz life
Not knowin what to do or where to go

Does anybody remember the days when you could bring a cassette tape to a
party and the DJ would drop it into a cassette deck and record his set
for you?  I still have old Jeno, Josh, Buck, Thomas, etc. tapes that
satisfy to this day. You can hear all the trainwrecks & coffin bumps.
Even cooler...they're the only copies and didn't cost me a cent.  Do any
DJs still do this?

Hey, Where's Jeff n'stuff?  His postings were always funny.  Anyone 
heard from Nancy who jetted off to New York?  What about that Mellissa 
gal with the model agency, who was going to book DJs?  And Is Paul 
actually gone, or just lurking?   Haven't heard from JSL in awhile.  I 
assume the Fairy Rave Godmother has not come back on line?  

It's weird how people come and go.  Names that pop up on my screen and 
say stuff for several months and then vanish.  I wonder what kind of 
churn or turnover the list has.  Stats, Brian?

Hello again, peeps.
   It seems that people got the wrong impression of what I was trying to 
say. We don't plan on having a line-up of ALL the DJ's listed below, 
only some of them. But usually a couple of the ones you want are already 
booked, or maybe we can't aford them right now. we still, however, would 
like to be able to contact them. Someday we may be able to have a party 
as such, and I'll be sure to let you guys know. But not yet, not on our 
first party. 
   Thanks to everyone who replied. If I din't send you a message 
already, let me know. Pobody's Nerfect.
   For everyone who wants to help, or has a demo tape they'd like to 
send, call me on fri, sat, or sun, or just mail the tape and I'll call 
you when we review it.

S.U.S.K. Productions (Stands for 'Society Under Siege Krew')
c/o David Olazabal
445 40th St. #3
Oakland Ca, 94609
(510)547-0969

Peace and Love,
Dave

P.S. Here is the original list. And BTW, Deepfog is one of the best 
trance Dj's I've heard lately. He gave me a tape, Champagne Trance, and 
I havn't stopped listening to it. Send him some mail at 
deepfog@hooked.net
 
Hey all...
   Some friends and I have been thinking about putting together a party 
for quite awhile, and we finally started doing something about it. We 
have had a few meetings, secured funding, and have a good idea of what 
we want to do. Now all we need is the DJ's. Following is a list of the 
ones we voted on. Anyone with any contacts that could reach these guys 
(or gals! - DRC's Awsome!), please send them along. And just as a 
question, has anyone thought of making a list and posting it on the 
hyperreal site? It sounds like a good idea if it hasn't already been 
done.

(in no particular order)
Doc Martin
Jeno
Simon
Tony
Jerry Bonham 
DJ Doubt
DJ Dan
Donald Glaude
Carlos
Frankie Bones
Sasha - england
Drc
Dutch
Crystal Method

   Now don't feel bad if we didn't mention your name, or a friend of 
yours. We DEFINITLY want any local or upcoming talent to be shot our 
way, so please send Name, Location, Music Type, and Contact to us.
   Thanks everyone for the help. This party is tenativly scheduled for 
the 27th of June, but that is not, NOT, set in stone yet. The name of 
the party will be "Incarnation, the chapter of earth." Please e-mail me 
any questions, comments, or ideas. All are welcome.

Peace and Love,
Dave

The fairy rave mother (leslie) is off the list but still goes out every
once in a while.

Greetings SFRavers =)

Apologies for the grossly commercial nature of this post - I wouldn't make
it if this group hadn't expressed interest in the past.

In any event, I've just finished digitally remastering and burning my first
CD release - Live @ Disco Dave's. This set was recorded at (Gateway) Dave
Abel's warehouse on November 27, 1997 at a farewell party for our friend
Rachel.

It's 73 minutes of acid techno trance, sliced, diced and well fucked up =)
(I can't take it out of my damn player ;)

It's been digitally remastered in my studio (the bass-station) with the
subsonic bass punched up and the the high end sparkled a bit... Put it on a
real system and it'll floor you =)

No color J card as yet (I might or might not ever get around to it,) so for
the time being it's all about the music, but I think the price is right.

If you want one, send a *stamped, self-addressed envelope* (big enough to
hold a CD) and $8.00 to:

Live @ Disco Dave's!
1425 Santa Fe Ave.
Berkeley, CA
94702

Please don't respond to the list about this.

take it easy
ethan

Today's semi-rave-related movie review:  Fans of Dr. Hunter S.
Thompson aka Raoul Duke might also want to check the 1980 flick 'Where
the Buffalo Roam'.  This one was inspired by Hunter's coverage of
Nixon's re-election campaign - needless to say, the two men had
issues.  Bill Murray plays a haggard Hunter pretty well, and some
psychopath delivers the goods as the Samoan drug attorney cum Mexican
survivalist cum 2nd Extremely Dangerous Maniac.

theres a moontribe dj named treavor who has a tape out called "hugs" and
what he does at the end of the tape is suddenly switch the turntable off,
in the middle of the song! so you hear the thing just slow down and stop
all of a sudden right when youre there peaking off of it

first time i listened to it was with friends morning after a party and we
sorta just zoned out into our own respective worlds, we were coming down
and such, and hearing that at the end of each side of the tape was the most
jarring experience ever

its kinda awful, but at the same time, funny. like treavor is fucking with
your head or somethin

About the only time we get cranky and mean is when those

Props to Manny, his party was part of the inspiration for what we do (I
know I've been to Velvet Shop and had a damn good time on several
occasions).  As well as props to Mad, and Static, and Phunkatech, and a
lot of other "done right" nights out there.

There's nothing wrong with two people (or groups of people) having similar
ideas at the same time.  People starting clubs often get asked to do
Monday nights... so we had two new monday night clubs start in a month... 
that means options... it's not just that there is something to do... there
are now multiple things to do in San Jose on a Monday.  SF has tons of
good stuff going on all the time and nobody worries about it there... 

How many times have you thought of something, and seen it come out months
or years later (even though you didn't tell anybody about it)?  It
happens. A club night takes a while to organize, and I don't see any
disrespect here from anybody.

There's differences between the two clubs, and there are differences in
people.  I think people will go to the club they want to go to, and that's
probably something that's not best decided via this list as a group or
community... it's a personal choice. 

Do what you like.

Peace,
AndyW

Hello,
You haven't met me, but I don't post much. I usaual just read what
others have to say and sometimes shed my opinon. I love to hear what
others have to say. It give me such insight and I always try to blend
everything new and unique I hear into my life good or bad. Right now I'm
sorrta in the same situation you are, A male that I was dating in the
scene him and I ended on bad terms also. We don't even speak anymore.
It's very uncomfortable to see him at parties. It was also his choice
not to be friends. So I just ignore him and go on with my life.
First off you need to be strong and remember that you are a wonderful
person, and you shouldn't let anyone get you down, no matter what. Raves
to me are my oulets to a stress free enviroment. This girl is obviously
very immature and you are way above her maturity. That potrays alot
about this girl. So you need to forget about her. It might be hard. but
you deserve so much better. Please don't sink to her level. That's
exactly what she wants. So the only way to not, is to ignore her. Show
her that you can have a great time without her, that your better than
that. Show her that you can continue your life without her. Remeber it
was her choice not to be friends. Msbey she'll wake up and relize  what
relaity is, and then maybe she'll come back to the real world and make
amends. You never know you could even be the bestest of friends. My
advice might not be helpful, but this is what I'm doing to deal with my
problem. You just seem like such an amazing person. I can tell that you
are a very positive person to the scene and us ravers can't afford to
lose such vaulable people. I don't know you but just by the way you
express yourself so beautifully I can tell your an open and caring
individual. So please turn that upside down grin to a smile. 
Remember I wuv you..
Love Victoria
"Sunshine"

Kidding. No one's actually naked.  But they're all naked in their own 
way when they step up in front of a crowd to play records, exposing 
their feelings through their music. 

Here are some pix of SF starz:

I've tried it and I've heard people try it but never really heard it sound

i do something where i turn off the record, let it wind down, then
manually wind it back up to 33 with my finger, kill it again, but this
time i wind it up to 45, let it slam at 45 til this particular break
in the song...then i slam it into 33 again.  The record now gives u
the illusion that it is still going MUCH faster than it actually is. 
I've only had this work on one of my records though..."get down" (for
those of u that know what i am talking about).

Uhhhh.... thought we all (me...) could use a break from the drama, so I wanted
to share this with you peeps...  hope nobody's offended!

~michael


Little girl asked her Mom, "Mom, may I take the dog for a walk around
the
block?"

 Mom says, "No, because the dog is in heat."

 "What's that mean?" asked the child.

 "Go ask your Father. I think he's in the garage".

 The little girl goes to the garage and says, "Dad, can I take Susie for
a
walk around the block. I asked Mom but she said the dog was in heat and
that I
should ask you".

 Dad said, "Bring Susie over here".

 He took a rag, soaked it with gasoline, and scrubbed the dog's butt
with it
and said, "Ok, you can go now but keep Susie on the leash and only go
one time
around the block".

 Little girl left and returned a few minutes later with no dog on the
leash.

 Dad said, "Where's Susie?"

 Little girl said, "Susie ran out of gas about halfway down the block
and
there's another dog is pushing her home".

I'm reading a book right now called _Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of
Adolescent Girls_ that talks about all the hard stuff girls go through
naturally and how our western culture makes it much harder on them.  A good
read for all you women out there and anyone else that is interested.  Not to
downplay what she's doing - I agree, sounds like just a very immature
personality, but being aware of the challenges all women face makes a little
sense out of the chaos.

As a proud owner of a tc electronics finalizer (new finalizer plus
info -- http://www.tcelectronic.com/finalizer_plus.htm), i'm into
compression...

Here's some quickies to get you started.

	http://www.proaudio.co.uk/comppa.htm
	http://www.proaudio.co.uk/comp.htm

Ultimately, the theory of compression will just point you in the right
direction. you just have to put various kinds of music through it and
listen to what it does. After about 6-12months of critical listening,
you start figuring things out. I think I'm almost there.

i read that book!  Last year as a matter of fact!  Great book, it's helped me 
to understand the grrrrlies more.  ;)  Both bOiX and GrrrliEs go through
a lot of crap and this book focuses on the female intracacies of growing
up in this fucked up world.  I highly recommend this book, it's a good read
and you just might learn something!

I was going to say something, but didnt want to get bashed my my friends
here.....so 2 people posted about weeklies. People will maybe go to one, then
go to the other, maybe stop by both. The thing is they will decide what they
like better. If someone stops going to afterglo because they like top shelve
better, then thats means that weekly is right for them. Look at the SF Raves
calender......3-5 parties in one night....all different, maybe equaly as good,
maybe not. The point is we all have the right to be informed about other
events....I think the SanJose scene will still be tight even if there are 5
weeklies all on a Monday, because almost all of us are looking for the same
thing, A good time. I dont think we need to bash on people for posting their
weeklies. My 2 bits..... =-)

Hi all! ]=}

 I'm still here but really busy so I just skim the list these days. 
Being the first email list I ever subbed to I just can't stay away.

 Dionysus Dreams is still alive and well. We helped out Martin O'Brian 
(sp?) at Vision recently and we will be helping with The Gathering on 
April 11th.

 For those that don't know Dionysus Dreams has assisted such groups as 
Harmony (3 Year, Spring Massive, 4X4), Mantra, CCC, Hunab-Ku, Koinonea, 
Sacred Dance Society, The Gathering, LightSeed, Warmth 2, St. Johns, 
Expansion 2 and many others.

 Hopefully we will see some of you at Burning Man this year!  :)

hugz,


Ran D. Dreams

i subscribed to the socal list, hoping to meet some people to hook up
w/ at DUNE later on.  you think sfraves has a lot of traffic?  i
steped away from my computer for about four hours soon after
subscribing.  when i came back, the score: sfraves 37, scraves 123. 
one-hundred and twentythree posts in four hours!?!  phew!  the thing
was, about 117 of them were all flames, and flames of flames, all
about like _one_ post, where some kid snuck into a rave, and posted
about it, and a bunch of people came down on the guy for "stealing
from the scene", and then a bunch of people came down on the people
who came down on the other people.  whatever.  it could have been an
interesting conversation about crime as counterculture, morality, or
something, anything, but really most of it was just a bunch of people
bitching at each other and calling each other names...

not that there weren't some interesting moments.  i responded to a
post about shel silverstien, and wound up talking to noah a bit.  but
then that could have happened here.  there were some other cool posts,
but everyone seemed more interested in responding to the flames,
rather than getting something else going.

there was one really interesting thread, though.  apparently, a girl
had posted a bitter letter about some guy who was abusive to her, and
how she hated him but kept coming back to him.  or something like
that, i don't think i ever saw the original, just the responses to the
responses.  this started a conversation about how sleazy, scumbag guys
("dogs" according to scraver slang) always seem to be constantly
surrounded by tons of fine babes, even though everybody and their
mother knows what the guy is all about.  saw some well written
responses that were pretty damn honest, well, blunt, actually.  which
is something i don't see as much of here, that sort of eyes-open
cynicism.  but maybe it's better that way...

oh, one other thing.  there are two groups on scraves:  ThOsE wHo
WrItE eVeRyThInG iN aLtErNaTiNg CaPiTaLs, and those who dont.  the
OnEs WhO wRiTe LiKe ThIs AlL hAvE aCcOuNtS oN aOl.  everybody else
hates them.  i think it's a generation gap thing.  well, dont worry,
WnDrTwIn29, we don't care if you write in alternating capitals or not.
 at least i don't.  most folks up here seem to get along just fine,
regardless of their age, race, sex, religion, and capitalization
style...

which is one of the many reasons i like sfraves so much :)

peace,
messiah

can someone send me some more info on the upcoming Dune party? a friend
of mine told me about her experience at Dune in '96, and since then it's
been something i've wanted to experience. i'm out in the midwest and
i've been wanting to go check out the sf area for awhile, as i'm
thinking about moving out there (these midwest winters suck ya know). so
maybe this would be a good time to do that and go to a good party as
well, if i can work it out. thanks:)

no, i didn't make it to notv at 1015 this week, though i've been
before, and liked it.  actually, i'm just talking about not having a tv.

i don't own one, and neither do my roomates.  it's a personal choice
we've all made, and one that we're all pretty happy with.  when you
lose that fuckin box sitting in the living room, all sorts of neat
activities spring up to fill the gaps.  talking for instance.  sure,
we all like chatting with friends, but when the tv is around, it's all
to easy to turn it on, and turn your friends (and yourself) off.  lose
the tv, and suddenly you're forced to entertain each other.  and
believe me, my roomies are _definitely_ funnier than any tv program
out there.  well, except maybe for mst3k...

we also play a lot of games: poker, backgammon, chess, scrabble,
grass...  i never used to play most of those games, but i find i
really enjoy them now.  they're like these little microcosms,
miniature replicas of the game of life, or some facet of it.  i can
feel my mind expanding, getting more limber, especially playing
something challenging like chess.  learning little lessons that can be
applied to the real world...

granted, there have been times i've come home from work and found
myself too tired to do a damn thing, even talk.  but on those rare
occasions, i simply allow myself to "turn off" on the couch, as if i
had a television, and just veg.  sure, i probably look sorta funny,
but that's just cause everyone associates that vegetative state with
watching tv.  i find i enjoy it better without, i just sit back, maybe
roll one, listen to some tunes, and let my thoughts wander.

tv is like this fucking drug, you turn it on and you just sit there,
immobile, eyes glassy, staring at this one spot.  well, i've been in
that state without the help of a television set, but the thing was, i
was at least thinking my own thoughts.  if you're watching tv, you're
silently absorbing all kinds of sick little messages:  i'm fat, i'm
ugly, i need to diet, i need to eat some burgers, i need a new car,
new clothes, i don't need it but it's on sale so i can save money by
buying it...  it's not just the commercials, the commercials pay for
every second of tv you see, and that's reflected in the programs,
implicitly.  everybody lives in these dream apartments with furniture
they couldn't afford if they really worked at a newspaper or whatever,
and you just sit there and feel more and more inadequate, but
subconsciously...

ok, maybe that sounds a little paranoid, and perhaps it is.  and there
are plenty of other socializing mechanisms in this culture to make you
a little consumerclone, and i'm still vulnerable to some of them.  but
honestly, i think that's what tv's all about, selling shit, and i
wouldn't put it past the networks to find a thousand little ways to
implant suggestions in your brain, all of them centered around your
buying the sponsor's product.  certainly they would if they could,
don't you think?

anyway, i don't think i'm gonna go back to owning a tv anytime soon...

I know a while back there were a few people saying they 
math majors or something similar. 
Im looking for a program that will generate these 3d
shapes of the 4th dimension. Any suggestions as to where
i might find something like that or some keywords
 i might use in my web search? 
I will be using then for my eye candy.
I would really like to get the formula or a 
wireframe for the venus shape.
thanks

Time to round up the south bay crew for dinner ... i'd like to see how many
of you would be interested in having dinner on saturday evening before
heading out to Frequency 8 or The Gathering ...

I'll be headed to The Gathering with a couple of newbies this saturday and i
was hoping to introduce them to some of you happy kids before the party ...
also we havent had a pre-party dinner in a while so this sounds like as good
a time as any to have one ...

i was thinking chili's on winchester at 7:30pm ... can i get a show of hands
for how many of you will show up so i can make reservations and stuff ..

also if anybody needs a ride i should have plenty of space in my car ...

:)

			     _Monday's Finals_


	Sunny, sunny and bright.  I would approach a friend to tell me all
the things I thought of myself, but then there is no cause.  All the birds
have flown on spirals up and down.  Into the sky so blue and gray and
boiling for days on end.  I would approach my friends to tell me why I am
so sad, but then there is no cause.  
	Yes, the sky is sunny.  Sunny and bright.  Blinding me with the
mirror of gases aflame and hot all over  so very bright.  I did not see
the rain, nor feel it strike the ground in ever growing circles that
spread.  Spread for very far and wider, and wider, and wider.  The
grasses, they bend their heads and whisper.  To the ground they touch with
psalms to the wind in dry heather voices.  
	The flowers I have sown, they did not grow this year.  Their
petals dried and colour faded within the ground.  Blossoms opened for the
pleasure of heaven and hell.  Who knows what lurks beneath the earth I
tread on worn weary shoes with dust within the crannies and gravel
grinding under the soles.  They used to shine in black leather splendour
all new and wet with father's money.  But all the running, the walking,
the turning  has covered the shine and hidden with dust.  The laces so
chewed with tears from sharp edges.
	The leaves tremulous over birch bark so white and unsoiled.
Powdered and lacquered with little black marks.  The leaves tremulous so
yellow and orange.  Shaking like butterflies on empty branches, sheltering
from the wind, the rain, the cold.  Falling and littering the ground in
islets and  rivulets of gold on black asphalt.  The ground so dark and
viscuous, smelling like new air and dead worms and squeaking with slippery
steps up and down the concrete hill.
	I walked through campus, past the towering campanile gray and
green with age.  The Mulberry trees were being cut of branches, all their
new fingers sheared with scissors and cruel saws spiked with teeth.  The
trees have gnarled knuckles snarled branches and screams pockmarked on
bloated boles.  I passed by, averting my eyes, saddened by whips and fags
littering the red brick walkway.  There was no sound breaking the crisp
autumn air.  Nothing to crackle the sharpness and crystalline silence.
The students trudged on with their heavy loads and humpbacked steps.
Heads were bowed, expressions grim.  I saw no color, their bright slickers
had no hue.  The atomic reds, banana yellows, crayon greens and
superman blues were just a mirage.  Nothing but empty memories of carefree
childhood with alphabet blocks and Tonka toys.  
	The  next day I passed the grove, morbid, empty, and chill.  A
lonely trill trapped within my hearing drew my vision upwards.  I ignored
the flickering yellow hazard tape that encircled the perimeter and
uncrimped my neck to look towards the heavens.  There was a rosy sunset
with wisps of baby blue, jewel-like and pretty like a first communication.
But strangest sight of all,  sharp needles of darkened growth punctured
the sky like so many masts at Newport harbour.  It was sublime to see the
last line of trees, standing as so many sentries ready to fall.  Their
batons in the air, a ragged leaf waving in the wind, and the sunny-sunny
bright sun setting across the bay.  I wanted to capture the moment,
graphic and sharp and full of today's little tensions.  But I bowed my
head, resettled my backpack, and trudged on to class.

its a device that squashes sound.  compacts it into a limited volume
range.  you set a threshold limit, and anything louder than that
gets clamped down. if you were standing at the mixer and lowering the fader
everytime a loud note hit you would be one.  whats cool is with really
low thresholds it makes everything sound like it is completely blown
fullblast even at low volumes.  as in all those trashy hiphop loops.

sure why not, as long as you have a mic and a mixer.  i dont know anything
about mic'ing a piano, but you could probably get cool sounds by just
experimenting.  radio shack PZM mics sound miraculously good and theyre dirt
cheap.  otherwise, most old analogs arent touch sensitive, but almost all
new keyboards are.
hope that helps :)

  ahh... i hear ya clear and loud.
  i detoxed from tv for a year and just recently started 
  vegetating on my couch again. today was the first
  day i watched jerry springer from beginning to end, 
  and the whole time i watched i was puking chunks
  of my sanity. 
  
  this show repulses me and i will never poison my
  brain with that brutal, button pushing, fist provoking
  crap. i'm sorry to all of you out there who enjoy 
  watching this show, but i will never ever change
   my strong feelings of anti respect for what this
   show represents. 

   todays beautiful happy topic was about men who are 
   playing two women. they brought out one woman who had
   a baby with this guy, who had a baby with another
   girl and she was nine months preggers. when the
   other girl came on stage, she immediately rushed
   her and tried to kick the crap out of her. now i am
   no medical specialist, but i have a feeling, call it
   intuition or maybe i'm psychic or something, that
   this isn't too healthy for a nine month pregger
   woman and her baby. 

   i understand that the topics that they so wonderfully
   explore is poop that happens in the real world. but there
   has got to be a better way of cleaning the poop than
   subjecting oneself to a show that promotes physical
   and verbal abuse. sure jerry brings in his deep 
   insightful caring comments and thoughts to try
   and bring peace and help to heal these poor poopy
   people, but its just not enough to positate a pregger
   woman having fists flown at her.

   am i the only one who doesn't like to watch jerry?

   -yasmin

   p.s. i no longer have cable and have to admit that i miss mtv
          the discovery channel, and a&e.

you know I grew up as a child pretty much without television by conscious
choice of my hippie parents.  i always kinda resented it then because i
would always feel left out at school when the kids started talking about
last night's cool episode of whatever show.  (and now today i really suck
at games like trivial pursuit with any tv references)  anyways, the first
time i moved into my own place one of my first purchases was the biggest
color tv i could afford and cable with ~all~ the channels.  for the next
three plus years i lived on the couch.  i stopped going out on the
weekends, i stopped reading books, i started eating nothing but tv dinners
and take out, friendships were lost with unanswered letters.  bleh, i could
go on and on.  my whole nonexistant life revolved the next episode of er or
seinfeld or hbo's saturday night new flick.  i'm quite embarassed when i
look back now.

so, about 9 months ago i realized what a horrible bore my life had become
because of television's hypnotic powers to suck you in and plant you
permanantly on the couch.  the very next day after realizing this fact i
called the cable company and had it turned off, all the channels.  now all
my television is good for is playing rented movies and you wouldn't believe
all that i've accomplished and how lively my social life has become.  i
have real live friends again! that i actually do stuff with.   you are
certainly right, messiah and so too i guess were my parents, tv is just
like a drug.  i know i feel like a recovering alcoholic sobering up from a
three year drunk.

now, if i could just get away from this computer. . .

j.

This is just a reflection of the size of the scenes...  the bay
area has around 3 million people.  The greater LA area has something like
8 million... plus another couple million in san diego, irvine, ect.

If only I could get the rest of my family to feel like you. They are 
fixated on the damn thing(T.V.). In my opinion tv's are all you said and 
more. They ruin lives by making you feel inadaquate, and like "I'm not 
good enough unless I look like a supermodel, and have tons of money." 
It's the downfall of western society.

Peace and Love,
Dave

----Original Message Follows----

no, i didn't make it to notv at 1015 this week, though i've been
before, and liked it.  actually, i'm just talking about not having a tv.

i don't own one, and neither do my roomates.  it's a personal choice
we've all made, and one that we're all pretty happy with.  when you
lose that fuckin box sitting in the living room, all sorts of neat
activities spring up to fill the gaps.  talking for instance.  sure,
we all like chatting with friends, but when the tv is around, it's all
to easy to turn it on, and turn your friends (and yourself) off.  lose
the tv, and suddenly you're forced to entertain each other.  and
believe me, my roomies are _definitely_ funnier than any tv program
out there.  well, except maybe for mst3k...

we also play a lot of games: poker, backgammon, chess, scrabble,
grass...  i never used to play most of those games, but i find i
really enjoy them now.  they're like these little microcosms,
miniature replicas of the game of life, or some facet of it.  i can
feel my mind expanding, getting more limber, especially playing
something challenging like chess.  learning little lessons that can be
applied to the real world...

granted, there have been times i've come home from work and found
myself too tired to do a damn thing, even talk.  but on those rare
occasions, i simply allow myself to "turn off" on the couch, as if i
had a television, and just veg.  sure, i probably look sorta funny,
but that's just cause everyone associates that vegetative state with
watching tv.  i find i enjoy it better without, i just sit back, maybe
roll one, listen to some tunes, and let my thoughts wander.

tv is like this fucking drug, you turn it on and you just sit there,
immobile, eyes glassy, staring at this one spot.  well, i've been in
that state without the help of a television set, but the thing was, i
was at least thinking my own thoughts.  if you're watching tv, you're
silently absorbing all kinds of sick little messages:  i'm fat, i'm
ugly, i need to diet, i need to eat some burgers, i need a new car,
new clothes, i don't need it but it's on sale so i can save money by
buying it...  it's not just the commercials, the commercials pay for
every second of tv you see, and that's reflected in the programs,
implicitly.  everybody lives in these dream apartments with furniture
they couldn't afford if they really worked at a newspaper or whatever,
and you just sit there and feel more and more inadequate, but
subconsciously...

ok, maybe that sounds a little paranoid, and perhaps it is.  and there
are plenty of other socializing mechanisms in this culture to make you
a little consumerclone, and i'm still vulnerable to some of them.  but
honestly, i think that's what tv's all about, selling shit, and i
wouldn't put it past the networks to find a thousand little ways to
implant suggestions in your brain, all of them centered around your
buying the sponsor's product.  certainly they would if they could,
don't you think?

anyway, i don't think i'm gonna go back to owning a tv anytime soon...

in Rob More's column in the examiner......

i thought that it was pretty funny....


"Overheard conversations, 

that's one of the things I like about San
Francisco. You don't hear the same kind of things you hear in Orlando,
things like "Is it an all-you-can-eat buffet?"

 The other night I was standing in line at a local nightclub.
Naturally, I was the oldest person there and felt bad about it until I
listened to the young woman behind me talk about her gum problems
caused by her new lip stud. I may be old, but I don't have gum problems.

 Then she started telling her friend about a rave she went to where
someone gave out a certain psychedelic, whose name or color I didn't
catch because of hearing loss caused by Doors concerts and Orange
Sunshine.

  "It was the big drug of the early '90s, but now it's cut with
speed," lisped Miss Lip Stud. "This was the real stuff, like you used
to get in the old days."

Sorry, I am not prepared for flashbacks to the good old days of five
years ago.

 Hey, kids, the early '90s was only two Middle Eastern buildups and six
  presidential sex scandals ago. My drug of choice back then in the
pre-Monica days was aspirin, same as now.

 Just say no to drug nostalgia. Ah, the early '90s: If you remember
them, you weren't there.
"

just thought i'd share some of the outside world....

Hey there!
Personally, I would do more things on "why do people rave?" and explain 
the different involvements.  You could do a totally different 
documentary on the music alone.  
How do people get started?  What keeps them all going to parties?

some things that people might say  the reason why they party is because 
of the following-and I could probably give you some names of great 
people to actually contact due to their unique sense of "raveness"-itsa 
new word  he he ;)
a) the spiritual factor
b)drugs-sad, but true
c)fun ye haw
d)acceptance by most everyone, very loving community
e)learning experiences
f)politics in raving

Just thought I'd help you out a little

maybe,
Danny

wow, a lot of responses on this one.  i have a feeling this no tv
thing is gonna become something of an underground movement, one day
soon.  it's almost a subversive act - by not watching tv, you are
removing yourself from the reality plane of the VAST majority of the
american population.  even in the deviant subcultures i hang in, it
seems most people watch the tube.  to avoid it is to avoid the main
method of cultural indoctrination in this society.  what will we come
up with to replace it?

hmmm, i think i can use this angle to push my new religion.  soon as i
come up with one, that is...

You're looking at it, bro.  The 'net is fast changing from a
means of light-speed communication and sharing of info and
ideas into a new breed of hucksterism and means of making
a buck.  Soon the net will be the focus of a severe backlash
like TV is just beginning to get now.  This may happen before
or after the whole thing goes down.  I give it two years.
You read it here first.

Ironically, I work for an internet company. . .

Hey, even if I wasn't a guy, I'd still read it!  I read all kinds of crap!  ;)
You name it, I've probably read something about it!  Sci-Fi, Fantasy,
Fiction, Non-Fiction, Supernatural, horror, astrology, astronomy,
Dune books (all of them actually!), and I have a real obsession
with the works of Nick Bantock.  I must have some sort of weird
fetish for stationary and office supplies.  I get all excited when I get
a new pen or some bad ass paper...  I think I've said too much...

We will replace it with the internet...same tube...different imput.
Tv could be a powerful tool to improve the world...if we 
got creative people to do the programming that was oriented
to something more helpful. maybe a messiah wannabe channel?

When i go to partys with real good visuals, i find these images
often open me up to some very inspirational, often spiritual
experiences. Of course the sight of mt shasts at sunrise
can do the same thing. The internet and computers
give individuals and artist the means to create these images
for the masses as well as giving the masses the choice as to
what they want to download into their synapses. It makes tv
interactive and gives the power and responsibility back to the people.

I went 5 years without tv..by choice and now watch it sporatically.
Those 5 years gave me a new perspective and now i watch
it with discretion and a perspective that allows me to
control my reaction as opposed to being a poor helpless
victim...i just dont buy this victim mentality.
I feel one needs to be aware of what is happening in the world
in order to improve it.

Like any other drug...you can use it or abuse it.

Radio Shack PZM's are the best value for capturing sounds. Remember, they arent perfect 
for everything! But they are wonderful mic's. 

When micing a piano, Keep in mind the fat strings are the bass strings(yes, this is the 
origin of the term "Phat":)~) the thin strings are the 'highs'. One mic cant capture 
all the sounds that a piano puts out due to the distance between the fat strings and 
the thin strings. So begin your expirimenting with two mics spaced to best capture the 
full sound. The very best sound engineers debate over the placement of microphones, so 
this should tell you that everyone of the pro's has expirimented before deciding on his 
personal favorite placements. Expiriment. You can never know everything.

I posted something similar to this a couple of months
ago before my computer crashed and therefore was unable to follow 
up on it.
If anyone is interested in a new mailing list, mostly ravers
that want to discuss the spiritual and philosophical
aspects of raving and making the world a better place in general,
email me and i will send you a couple of web pages to check
out and get more info.

following is some of the suggested topics of the list.
The list is really taking off now and some really 
fascinating and inspirational people are participating.

I was hoping the smiley face would be sufficient. I apologize. Phat does not come from 
the size of one's strings(dont tell this to a bass player)

Depends on where you grew up. When I surfed it related
to deep punishing barrels or fat lips (of waves that
is). On the mountains boarding, it was how big and
crazy you got in the air so how fat pretained to how
big. Or you could say Pretty Hot And Tempting regarding
to ladies (no offense meant there) or Phat blunts
yada yada yada. I was pretty sure skaters formed it
from big Phaat airs.... just my half a cent

I don't think RatShack makes those PZM mics anymore, though.  I could be
wrong, but I heard this awhile ago on the net.

LTJ was here about a year ago, promoting Logical Progression Level 2,
and he spun at VSF.  Logical Progression Level 3 is coming out in
the very near future (YEA!), so keep yer eyebones peeled.

Derrick May has been (train)spotted at Space Children massives,
last summer, I think.

I hear you on Carl Cox.  Wasn't he at Nikita not too terribly
long ago?  I could be terribly mistaken.

Dunno from Grooverider or phantom 45, though.

Steve.

funkmaster flex from nyny is one, he does a hip hop radio show that's
pretty big in nyc, you can get tapes of his shows in underground rap
stores there.  a few years ago he put out a mix cd, which i bought. 
it's pretty cool, he cuts and scratches things up, and throws in
freestyle sessions from all the top rappers of the last few years. 
it's a pretty cool cd, the overall effect reminds me of rap shows you
hear on the east coast, with crazy mixin, people freestylin over live
beatloops, and the dj talkin the talk over the breaks...

he put out a second mix last year, but i didn't get it, so i don't
know if it's as good or not.

-messiah


ps. i keep askin people where i can go to hear some hip hop, but the
only place i've heard mentioned is deco.  oh yeah, and the elbo room. 
i know there's gotta be somewhere else.  has anyone out there been to
a kmel party?  kinda curious what that would be like...

A friend just sent me this .exe program called RaveBoy.  It's this dude 
with a big head and small body.  You can hit record, punch in a few 
moves, hit play and he dances your routine to the music playing in the 
background. Cute...  it was made by Disney?

Hi all,, 

I'm going to need help doing some promotional work over the next
while, and I need an 
intern.  It will be approximately 4 hours per week, usually on Monday
afternoons.  It 
will be mostly sending out promotional tapes of me and other Aware
Environments 
associates.  I am preferrably looking for someone who is more a dj or
promoter, this 
would be most beneficial for that type of person.  You must be able to
make it to the 
Berkeley area on Monday afternoons.  This is not a paid internship,
however, I do have 
decks at my office so I'm sure if you bring your records it won't be a
problem to hang 
out and spin here and there. 

Interested parties should email me.  This will be fairly long-term,
and the volume will be 
increasing after the first of the year. 

Please, if you have questions, send them with your statement of
interest. 

Thanks. 

Deepfog

here is a sample of what someone wrote today
on the list i have been telling you about. This
list is pretty interesting if you like this type of discussion.

------------------------------------

That's what you call "liquid dancing"?  I do something like that quite a
bit.  As the dance deepens in trance, beams, waves, or balls of light
and energy often show up.  These energies can also take the form of
geometric shapes and patterns; the simpler ones are of spirals and
triangles.

At times we dance as separate beings.  Other times we become one and are
dancing through my body.  Two of the more complex shape patterns that
visit resemble a lotus blossom with a long root and streaming fount of
light, and the other is a multi-armed hydra like being shooting strands
of energy out from the arms in a web.  (And no, i am not doing
psychedelics during this, although i do imbibe a sacred toke or 2.)
When either are dancing me, my feet tend to be rooted to the earth.

I experience these energies as having not so much personalities, but
most definately sentience and purpose. I'm aware a communication usually
takes place during a visit.  After awhile i may step out of the dance
for a few minutes to capture the essence by drawing an image, or
speaking a few words into a tape recorder. Actually, a good portion of
Circle of Shaman was penned primarily through this type of trance dance
experience.

It also has the effect, as you mentioned Troy, of raising kundalini
energy, but this isn't limited to happening only with liquid
dancing.  Has anyone ever had what feels like an energetic orgasm during
dance?  (gee, i feel a blush comin on.  you don't even know me and here
i am getting so personal.  giggle.  oh well.)  Anyway, yes, i do feel
kundalini energy getting stimulated as well.  It varies in intensity
from xperience to xperience.

jed, regarding your concern about western culture not valuing dance and
other similar creative expression as healing or spiritual modalities - i
couldn't agree with you more.  Western religion has systematically
severed the the body from the head and called it and anything to do with
the sensual world sinful...the root of all desire that must be quelled
through transcendance.  The church fathers struck the part where Jesus
taught forms of sacred circle dancing which integrated breath, movement,
and chant as ways to, not just pray, but commune with God.  I'm
recalling that phrase in the Gospel of Thomas attributed to Jesus:  "To
the universe belongs the dancer.  S/he who does not dance does not know
what happens."  (Another translation is "does not know his
immortality.")  How interesting.  Does not know what happens.  There's
stories and info in dem rhythms!

HOW TO KILL THE TELEVISION MONSTER WITHOUT UNPLUGGING IT

1. turn off the sound on your TV

2. turn on two different stereo systems--one with your choice of wordless
music, the other with either AM radio or some spoken word stuff.

3. sit back and enjoy!  or take control by changing channels as the music
changes!

my personal favorite: late nite news with firesign theatre and aphex twin.
boy, there are some odd current events out there.

on a somewhat related note--imagine if the audio from boys' toy commercials
and girls' toy commercials were switched.

"I don't need
 A TV screen
 I just plug the aerial
 Into my skin
 And let the signals
 Run through my brain
 TV O.D.
 TV O.D."

Well, I must say that this was a very nice thing for my ears.  The sound
to it had was very acid and very smooth.  The mixing is very clean and
almost unnoticable.  I have to give phat props to him for just putting a
nice set together.  It even had my head bobbing while driving in the car
to the store.  Good job man. 

However, besides the overall beauty of the tape.  There was one
incredibly attrocious act committed that will be hard for me to forgive. 
So at the end of the first side, the tape just ended in the middle of the
song.  O.k., that kinda sucks but it usually isn't a big deal in my
reality.  However, the reason why I must bitch and moan is because it was
cut off by one of my all time favorite techno remixes in existence.  It
cut off right towards the beginning of the song Toxygene by the Orb. 
This remix is the "Kris Needs Up For a Fortnight Mix".  How could someone
have the gall to cut that one off at the end of a tape.  Hmmmmm, oh well.
 It was a good mixtape overall and I would recommend it to others to
purchase it for some good tunes to dance to.

Good Job C@

Bye all.

Trip out! My friends and I used to do this back in middle school when I was a 
little skater. We would put on some cheese soap opera and mute it, and then
blare some hardcore ala Minor Threat, the Decendents, MDC, etc. There would be 
these occasional moments of briliance where the actors and actresses were 
synched up with the music and appeared to be singing along to 'John Wayne was a 
nazi', 'I'm not a loser' or other similar love songs. 

Back in the day,

Looking forward to Sanctuary this Sunday.
Here's a way for all you cast away Easter celebrators/debaucherous
youths to bbq and enjoy life. Bring your records and some food.
Looks like we are going to have some live stuff going on (to be
confirmed).
Let's hope the weather holds up.  I'll start around
2pm... email me if you need directions.

:)

    All that stuff is fine and dandy, but make sure you include the meaningful
aspects of raving.  Such as community, spirituality, individual expressionism,
diversified acceptance, and all the fundamental basics of what raving is all
about, not just the stuff at the parties.   But counterculture aspect of it's
origins, Its intrinsic valeu, and it's important place on our society, as well
it's contributions toward our cultural development and utopian dreams.

when i was 14 me and pj were in a band together with chuck (who went
on to drum for a band called superchunk) and steve (who went on to be
schitzophrenic).  we were the band with no name.  anyway my parents
had this OLD old vcr with this wierd button that said "audio dub" on
it.  if you pressed it while you were watching something, it would
record the sound from whatever channel was piping through it over the
original soundtrack of the tape.  or if you plugged in a microphone,
whatever the mike picked up.

we would stay up all night, recording random snippets of late-night tv
into bizzare cut and paste pastiches.  then, we'd rewind the tape, and
record strange industrial soundscapes over them, using guitars,
walkie-talkies, phazed spoken word rants, fans with tinfoil,  electric
organs, xylophones, and whatever else was handy...

Does anyone have a copy of this 20/20 special, "Stop the Rave"
that aired on Feb. 20, 1998 on videotape?  
I missed it and as far as I know, I can't order a copy from them.
I wanted to use some of the footage in it as "found footage"
for my documentary.

If anyone has a copy that they'd be willing to lend me for a few
weeks, I'd greatly appreciate it.  or info as to how I might be
able to get an official copy from abcnews if it is possible.

thanks!
much love
& besitos!

Sorry if I'm gushing but I just got home from interviewing
dmarie, susan, and emily (sorry if I got those names wrong!)
from eklectic and they are great people.  Intelligent,
well-spoken, and friendly.  just fabulous.  I highly 
recommend that everyone check out their weekly if they
haven't already because great vibes + great people + great
music = a great time!  

It's people like these 3 women who help contribute to the scene.
and all of you, too, of course!

But anyhow, I'm just happy and I hope I do justice to the people
I interview and the parties I film cause my camerawork is a little
crappy. sigh.

much love

Looks like in the month of March, there were 166 subscribes and 184
unsubscribes.  There apparently were a few people who appeared to subscribe
then resubscribe often, for some reason.  But most of those are unique; I
have no idea how many subscribed and then unsubscribed within the month of
March.  I'd say there's a fair bit of turnover there, when the total list
size is only 430.

As a point of interest, sfraves-calendar had 67 subscribes and 60
unsubscribes, and the total list size is 1237.

Friday and Saturday are both big, with parties spread throughout Northern
Cali on Friday (SF, Sacramento, Modesto, Berkeley), and then the
Gathering on Saturday should be a good old-school party, the 
Reinforced Tour brings some jungle legends to the city, Frequency-8
continues its dedication to Trance, and finally, a real afterhours
party, Love Bizarre starting at 3:30am.  Then on Sunday, Stompy brings
it all back into the house.  I think I'm also going to try to make it
to Eklectic to start off the weekend...

Subject: JUNGLE:  Eklektic:  Ground Score says...
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

...here's a little story I'd like to tell about three yin sisters you know
so well, it started way back in history with Miss E and Q and dmarie.  No ~
we had no little horsie named Paul Revere but....this is what we do have.

Eklektic

We would like to invite all y'all to the bumpin' upstairs jungle adventure
otherwise known as EKLEKTIC in SF. 

DJ Dara (NYC) alongside SF locals B (with a female MC) and Mateo of Control
Dek, will be filling your dance card, making your ass move and giving you
plenty to sweat to.

I know...I know, what about our residents Sage and Stareyes?  

Well,  Sage graciously gave up her set for fellow out of town junglist Dara.
Dara had grooved and dug our vibe back when Dieselboy was in town, but Dara
had not yet played Eklektic.  Since he's rollin through town, he asked to
gig.  Sage was down and why not, she still get's paid!  (=

So remaining true to our name Eklektic, so is our line-up.  DARA ~ B ~ Mateo
- tomorrow - thursday

A video on raving and will be shot by a college student working on her
thesis.  Metropolitan magazine star reporter Michelle Goldberg will be in
the house doing a review and write up, a Vancouver promoter will be chillin'
to check the SF scene, articles on flier art will be written and many
girlies swooning over Dara will be present.

	[Steven Allas]  I would be interested to know how many hours
everyone spends in front of their computer.  I know I rack up some
unruly hours on mine, both at work and at home.  Would the reasoning be
that at least on the computer you are thinking whether surfing sites or
chatting?  I can say honestly that I do plan my t.v. consumption around
sports, discovery channel specials, or a&e.  I don't watch the t.v. for
news much.  I build a base of contacts around the world and we
communicate through e-mail or talk on freetel.com.  I doubt the media
gives us the real news so I'd rather find it myself from private
citizens.

Has anyone heard of this?  I think it may be a movie but am not sure.  I
just know that Roger Sanchez, one of my fayv dj's has something to do
with it.  I'd appreciate any information, thanks.

I believe this shows that he is really into his art.
That he is so intranced by the music he is spinning
he honestly doesn't recognize the tape is ending. I
consider this a good thing. 

I have been reading how folks are complaining about
one side of the tape ending in the middle of a song.
This shows improvisation at its best, the set isn't
all planned out he is playing what feels right. I
hate it when people plan out every mix it just
doesn't seem very much like true mixing. I will play
maybe one or two mixes that I know are going to rock
and feel the rest of the set. My props to C@ Weasel
for playing by what he feels!

Oh! Derek I know your just being facetious it was just
a good opportunity to make a point, lates.

After a very enlightening meeting, and an incredible performance by
the "George Lucas Love Slave All-Stars", Joshie, Stevie and I fought
the evil forces of sleep and went out to Eklektic
to dance and dance and dance to some incredible music.


As soon as you started walking up the stairs, you could feel the heat
ooooozing out into the stairwell.  BOOOOOOM into the room as you pop
through the doorway, and such nice faces smile and boogy up to you. 
It was impossible to just stand around, some part of you had to move. 
The beat grabbed your body and made it groove all around.  The whole
room was just bumping up and down, together, so it
looked like one huge beast.  Every once in a while a hand would pop up
to give it up for the dj.  It was just real swell, you know?

And this little chicky smiled all the way home to Santa Cruz.

The reason why it cut off was cos on the master CD the mix was 60 minutes, so putting it onto a 45 min side means something somewhere is going to get cut. C'est la vie.

Anyone going to the Field Trip full moon party in Santa Cruz on Sat? CU there.

C@weasel

From: drekster@juno.com (Derek J Fieldsoe)

However, besides the overall beauty of the tape.  There was one
incredibly attrocious act committed that will be hard for me to forgive. 
So at the end of the first side, the tape just ended in the middle of the
song.  O.k., that kinda sucks but it usually isn't a big deal in my
reality.  However, the reason why I must bitch and moan is because it was
cut off by one of my all time favorite techno remixes in existence.  It
cut off right towards the beginning of the song Toxygene by the Orb. 
This remix is the "Kris Needs Up For a Fortnight Mix".  How could someone
have the gall to cut that one off at the end of a tape.  Hmmmmm, oh well.
 It was a good mixtape overall and I would recommend it to others to
purchase it for some good tunes to dance to.

Good Job C@

If you are a fan of or curious about FSOLondon, do yourself
a big favour and check out their LIVE ISDN show (not the
ISDN that's been released) at http://www.astralwerks.com
It is soooo freaking good, and includes tracks from Dead
Cities, which gets better every time I hear it.

If someone held a gun to my head and forced me to pidgeonhole
FSOL, I'd place them somewhere in the IDM/trance/techno rangs,
but then again, what the hell do I know?

I work in Monterey. Sure is a perdy place indeed.  I finally had to
turn my desk around so I didn't face the ocean. Too distracting.  I
got to the point where I thought the otters were mocking me.  But
occasionally I see the reflection of the ocean on my computer monitor
and I take a look.  Really beautiful all by itself.

But just a few minutes ago I popped in my King Britt presents Sylk 130
*When The Funk Hits the Fan* cd, and now it's just plain goofy.

The waves are wooshing in and out to the same time as the songs. 
People walking around almost look like they're dancing, or at least
have a bit of a groove in their step.  And this dog walked by and his
tail was wagging to the same beat as some of the vocals.

Normally Monterey has this cheesie quality to it, but now with King
Britt in the background, everyone doesn't seem as white bread.

For anyone who hasn't heard this CD, go get it.  Dig in the couch  for
spare change if you have too. It's not just a bunch of songs, it's
like a history lesson in funky music, using old styles and new styles.
 Ahhhh....


La Te Da. I need sleep.

Tabitha

Yeah, Steve had a good point here in his response to me.  Is there
anybody out there that can go to this website and possibly record it for
me.  God, I don't know.....I'd do anything.  I'll clean anybody's
bathroom for a month if they can somehow record it for me.  I'll even
reemburse people for the tape that is used.

plEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEasE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thanx.

I haven't heard the tape youre' refering to, but I did get the pleasure of
hearing C@tweasel spin at Velocity Quest and his set blew my mind. I am very
impressed by his music and his style. If his tape sounded anything like what
the set I heard him spin was then the tape is amazing. However I can also
understand Derek's point (duh I just posted about it a few days ago) about
getting into a track and have it cut out in the middle, and I realize
sometimes the tape isn't long enuf but maybe just fade out the track at the
end of the tape so as not to be as painful on the ears and the heart. I
really look forward to getting to hear this tape soon.

hey,

I heard a nasty rumor that they weren't working together anymore.  Does
anyone know if this is true?  The are definetly one of the best if not the
best electronic musicians I've heard.  I've been waiting to see them live.
I'd be disapointed if that can't happen.

AFAIK they don't play live apart from ISDN broadcasts from their studio.

Is this the RA file that starts off, in a speak-n-spell sort of voice:
"The Future Sound of London, Live via I S D N"?

I've got a shitter of a proxy here at work, and can't get alot of RA files
that aren't made available via streaming HTTP, but I can get this one.
I've got a tape deck (shitty dumpster find, but it works), and I can
record this.

I've just started listening to it, and yeah, it rocks.  FSOL has undergone
a sort of change since I started listening to them back in the Amorphous
Androgenous/Papa New Guenia (?)  days...they were hella ambient back then,
now they're more like trip-hop almost.  It blew my mind when I heard the
"We Have Explosive" single...FSOL doing straight up big-beat, almost!

They rock...I'm definitely gonna bring a blankie tape in next week and
record this. 

Hey, how many, or any, sfravers also check out the IDM list?  lemme know!

a friend of mine who really enjoys fsol has been looking
for their video. Was that ever released and if so,
 where can a copy be obtained? I checked their web site
but didnt find much.

I have to pick a 5-10 min dialog from a play for my drama class and I was
wondering if anybody out there had any suggestions as to a good piece to
use. I only post this as I know there are a large number of you who are
active in the artistic communtiy and come in contact with good plays. I was
hoping to benefit from your experience. Thanx in adavance.

This word was used in the black ghettos long before ravers used it.
the first time i ever hear the word was a black kid in Baltimore describing
a girl to me,
and I was like  "you think she's fat??  Geepers homey, are you nuts?!"

it was an acronym, he told me, for "Poossy, Hair, Arse, Tets", as in:  "she
has a nice body."

yes, i know, it's crewd & lude.  i read a hip/hop history book recently and
it gave the same definition.  Supposedly it originated in the late 60's or
early 70's.

i keep seeing his name on fliers.   anyone have the beef on this kid?

if any of you get the chance to go to all in the family..

MAKE SURE YOU GIVE AMANDA BIG PHAT HUGS for me!!!
she's gone through a long 9 months and I'm very proud of her for keeping
herself together and building her strength as opposed to breaking down. We
could all learn something from her, taking responsibility not only for
herself but her family members.. I know I've learned alot from her,
myself..
	ANYWAY! Make sure you NUT really HARD to the bassbin twins as well
for me.. I remember their set @ LifeForce last september -- *oh my gosh*

Jason Mouse originates from Boston but came out here hmmm I think around
November of 96 or not long after that (I remember this coz the first Audio
Impact was around then, and I got a free tape with Flux spinnin oldskool
beats and Jason Mouse on the other side)... Jason Mouse runs his own label
Emocean Records (or ran, I'm not sure), has produced a few of his own
tracks  and lives out here now, and
frequents for a bunch of krus' weeklies, but I'm not sure if he's a member
of Phunckateck or not.. I don't think he is.. dmarie, i bet you got the
411!! :)
	But this brother is serious about his jungle, and it shows in his
KICKIN SETS! He rocks!! :) And totally deserves to spin w/ Goldie. Can't
wait for *DIGITAL*

I saw a FSOL "short film" a long time ago on MuchMusic in
Canada.  It was called "Lessons From the Electronic Brain". 
It was about 25 minutes long and was totally excellent. 
Sadly, I haven't ever seen it again (don't even know if it
was released).  If you find it, please please let me know!

They played it right after a super long video of Coldcut's
"Atomic Moog 2000".  Very cool.

I saw a young girl 8yo dressed in fashion that would
not be uncommon at a rave and I looked down to see a
smiley face on her shoes and saw the label happy
kids.  

I get so jealous of the wacky clothing options for kids
I wish I could sew sometimes so that I could make
kids style clothes that would fit me.  maybe create
some underoos for big kids

In regards to Jason running Emocean, It was actually Steve Barons label(still
is...check the newest release with XLR8R's Andrew Smith(a.k.a RED ORC) and
himself / "FUNKED UP"). Jason was helping run it as well as being an artist
for the label. Jason no longer works with the label, but still continues to
produce.


<<I'm not sure if he's a member of Phunckateck or not.. I don't think he

He is a member of PHUNCKATECK...and has been since he moved out here.


<<this brother is serious about his jungle, and it shows in his KICKIN SETS!>>

Jasons talents, both in production and DJing, are highly regarded by all of us
in the crew. I speak for everyone in PHUNCKATECK when I say that he is the
best DRUM & BASS producer in the U.S. We definetley give him room to swing his
axe, while we watch and learn. The reason we asked if he'd like to be a part
of PHUNCKATECK is because of his prominent love for what he does.....that is
something that we are about, and we hope that it comes thru everytime we play
or make tracks.
 
Respect,
Noel

t.v. is such escapism...people avoid all aspects of themselves to 
saturate themselves with t.v. : the Passive Medium. passive becuz you 
just sit there and take in take in take in! there is absolutely nothing 
interactive about it; too much breeds social stuntedness, i think. i 
don't watch it and haven't for a couple of years....well, with the 
exception of the occasional x-files, south park (ha! those little kids 
are twisted--get more from the inet than t.v. tho') and ....... ok, ok. 
jerry springer. and believe me, it isn't something I'm proud of. it just 
holds some kind of sick allure because it is so twisted!!! total 
hyperbole. it just seems sooo distorted and it makes me laugh! it's like 
gorging on mickie d's: you crave it, you eat it, it tastes good and you 
almost get high just knowing you've done something bad and there is this 
little thrill involved....yeah, jerry is my mcdonald's french fry. 
greasy, catch a taste of it, feel ill, turn off the toob for a few 
months. saturated.
p.s. definitely not down with kicking pregnant women.

I have 2 beat up old subs that still have some life left in them. they 
just look ratty.

1 cerwin vega 18" .....   100$

1 community vbs60...125$ 
it has an internal crossover and four 15" speakers 

A cheap way to add some sub freq's  they both are very efficient and 
need little power.

also a Carver 1.5 amp rated at 1100 watts but really puts out about 900 
watts(4 ohms) ----350$

and some really kickin home speakers Cerwin Vega 3 ways with a 15"--250$
(worth, to me, 400$) they take up to 400 watts and will rattle the 
dishes.

Sorry about your vehicle...maybe you should buy a new vw 
beatle.

I will be at the gathering doing the gatekeeper thing.
Still looking for a bribe if anyone has a copy of painter5 for the pc.

I would offer you a ride but i live with in walking distance
so unless you want to ride on my shoulders i cant offer you much.

Lots of great partys tonight on the full moon. The full moon is in libra
tonight...so that should be very nice, but there is still some
tension in the air so be extra nice to people and try not
to let the drama upset you. Mercury is still retrograde
so communications and transportation is still messed up.
Allow extra travel time and check the details twice.

Happy holidays wherever you go tonight.
Maybe we could have a meeting spot at the gathering in tht main lobby
at 2pm?

	><{{{">  <"}}}><

		foolish fish

ps the rumors about madonna being at the gathering in her new
beatle to give a way samples of her new "rave hit" are totally 
unfounded.

Man, I'm gone for one week in Mexico and look what I miss! You guys
don't have to worry about getting a cabin. I already have one reserved!
It's for the weekend of April 24-25-26. In two weeks! The cabin is right
on the edge of Donner lake with a GREAT view. The place is BIG! And I've
worked it out so that it'll only cost $30 per person. And I also have
something of a line up: 

VERTIGO
RADON
PENGO (ME)

Everyone is welcome to bring their records ofcource! I'm sorry I haven't
been around this week to talk about it. Also, if anyone sent me email
this week I didn't get it. I lost everyting from when I was gone 

So if you want to come please send me a check (And send me an email when
you do so I know it's in the mail)

if anyone heading up to F-8 tonight has a space open in their car, let me
know if you can give me a ride. I totally want to go to this party, and
I'm carless in San Francisco. I'm an entertaining passenger, because I'm
filled with interesting facts and nonsense. Plus I have psychic powers,
and I'll levitate your car like in that Beetle ad so we can avoid traffic
and have a nice view.

Okay, so I'm bullshitting. Seriously, tho, I'd totally dig a ride. E-mail
me at giles@bowkett.com (I'm on the digest, and a reply to sfraves won't
turn up in my mailbox until tomorrow, which'd be kinda ironic) or give me
a call at 415-474-4426.

Thanks. :-)

In a message dated 98-04-10 23:09:04 EDT, you write:

<< prominent love for what he does.....that is
 something that we are about, and we hope that it comes thru everytime we play
 or make tracks. >>
 You can always feel when a dj has love or passion for what they are doing by
the way they react with the music that is coming out of the speakers thru
them.......i think as i watch a dj spin and they bounce to the rhythm or bob
there head to the beats then they are feeling what they are doing...as dj's
rock the crowds and get them going you know that they aren't in it just to
make themselfs feel cool they are working the crowd to get them going to some
dope ass tracks..... well okay talk to you soon love moonbaby--Jenn

Hello, everyone!

This is the most meaningful holiday time for many cultures
and for many faiths, so I hope this message finds all of you
in peace, good health, and a sense of renewal, as our
precious Mother Earth regenerates and as the wheel comes
around, ready for another spin. And now, succumbing to
popular tradition, and for those of you who find meaning in it,
I say alleluia! Alleluia! Christ is risen from the dead, and become
the firstfruits of them that slept!

Peace and joy in whatever this holiday means to you,
Eric

In the 20'z we had the Flapperz and Anti-Prohibition 
Gang warz...
In the 40'z, we had the Zoot Suiterz, and the Lindy Hopperz.
In the 60'z,Woodstock waz the most spectacular display
of human love and affection ever witnessed at one gathering
any where on the face of the planet. Oh yeah, the funky
concept of tie-dye waz invented at this point by the cool 
ass hippy'z.
In the 80'z, we were still reeling from the effects of the
disco dancin John Travolta and the one and only Soul Train.
This said era waz dominated by such comical characterz az
'Boy' George and Cindi Lauper. I don't know what to call
them, and let's not forget about Madonna'z rize to fame with
hits like Border line and Jimmy Jimmy. 
    Now entering the New Millenium, a new breed haz arizen.
Enter the Party Kidz. Underaged Adolescents staying
out way past every1'z curfew and cramming every conceivable
illicit substance down their throats and just trying to get
az fucked up az they can.
While we all have had our share of spending a whole night
drooling in the corner spun out of our mindz while attending
a phat party, most of us had the common sense to realize 
that this waz not acceptable behaviour to carry out on a 
weekly basis. But not the Rave Baby. Party Kidz are nothing
more than Rave Babiez who grew out of the habit of getting
az aced out of reality az they could only after they had 
hit rock bottom(getting strung out, lozing everything, and
only then realizing addiction to whatever poizon they had 
picked).
    Okay, so while some of us continued to get wasted, and 
otherz realized that wasted wazn't where it waz at, we still
have a new wave of party goerz entering the scene every month.
What impression are the newcomerz supposed to get about the
now clouded and confuzed scene?
Even in the magic mushroom dayz of the hippiez and the mystic
mescaline dayz of Heavy Metal viewerz, in the dayz before
LSD waz banned, people were not getting az fucked up az the 
Rave Babiez. Oddz are that any new gen-Xer entering the scene
now will partake of more controlled substancez within a 
month than the freelovin' swingin' sex-pressive hippiez of 
the 60'z did in 2 or more months. 
    However, with the help and aid of an experiened guide,
the guiding hand of an experienced party goer, new rave
babiez won't have to learn the true meaning of a rave the
hard way. I mean yeah sure,everyone wants to get a little
blasted and high az fuck, therez no problem with that. Ya
wanna hippy flip, cool... Candy flip, go right ahead, MX Missle,
Fire away, Coco puffs, I'm cuckoo, parachuting your thing,
feel free to do so.
What I'm saying iz that there iz no need to try out 4 
different drugz at the same sitting. And I feel that this 
point iz not made clear for most first time raverz, who get
the obvious yet wrong impression about the type of thing to
do at a good party by nitro sucking shroom swallowing smoked
out speed snorting e-kid laying in hiz own puddlez of urine 
and multicolored vomit... Get what I'm sayin?
    Misunderstand me not, I've been more than my fair share 
of high before, but I've never been incoherent and I've never
not known what I've just put in my body. I've also never put
hellacious amounts of entheogenz in my body.
I've heard of people taking 4-5 hits of E within the same 
2 hourz trying to 'Get Off' az best they can. Ten hits of
acid disappear down the same manz throat. Half an ounce of 
shroomz 'tween teo people... Or how bout the first timer
with their paycheck in their pocket on Friday night answering
to every call of 'X' and 'Fry', az well az getting taken by
the venderz and people selling other shit. Why not make
it clear from the beginning of the party that you're not
suppozed to get all fucked up beyond belief. I've recently
seen a flier that stated right on the front that G would not
be tolerated within its doorz. Its not much by itself, but,
its a great start for what it's worth. There iz nothing 
wrong with getting your high on, but be selective when
wasting the limited grey matter. You only have so much of 
it and you can only get so high at one time... No matter
how much pot you smoke, you'll only get so stoned. No matter
how many hits of E you take, you're gonna get spun. There iz
no need to take more than two hits of acid, you're gonna fry.
You don't need to eat more than two eigths of shroomz cuz 
you're still gonna get off. This iz the Point that so many
have difficulty understanding, sillly az that might be. I 
guess some assume that 20 hits of Fry will make you see more
than 2-3 hits will. Might be true, but you'll be just az 
fuckin incapacitated so what doez it really matter? Sure 
you will relive the sinking of the Titanic after 1/2 oz. of
shroomz, but you'll be so fuckin shroomed out that you won't remember
shit about sinling anyway. So maybe it will feel
8 timez az good to drop 4 hits of X instead of 1 or 1-1/2.
Who carez if you're E'n so hard that your teeth grind and 
no one can understand a fuckin word your sayin... 
     I guess this iz nothing more than a warning early 
Easter 98 mornin for the purpose of lettin y'all know some
one iz concerned with the posterity of the scene, and I do wish
to keep all my party peops alive until we're old and decrepit
haz been fart knockerz doin dancez in front of our kidz
like our parents do in front of us... But if we keep destroyin
ourselvez, by not watching out for each other, where will
we be in the near future. What will we have in the near future.
Sure I can down 40 geltabz and not sweat it, but can I 
eazily and clearly what I waz doin exactly what I waz doin
1 year ago? 
    If reading this made you scratch your head or set off
a warning light somewhere in the back of that partied out
teenage brain of yourz, Take a sec to look at your involvement
in the scene... How involved are you really? How much are 
you doing really? What do you spend on drugz really? How many
different 1'z are you on at your partiez? 
I'm exhausted and can no longer continue, so pleaze feel 
free to get back to me any time you pleaze...    
    Only cuz I care...

Although very belated, here is the continuing MooK saga of spring break.

Day 4: 
Checked out the second week of Afterglo at the Cactus club in SJ. Met a
lot of SFRavers danced my patutes off and had a blast. The music was
outstanding, but there was no jungle that night =(. Got to hear Monty
spin and I just fell in love with the one track by Melloween called the
King that he spun. WoW!! (For those that don't know it- its a house track
that has MLK's Let Freedom Ring speech mixed over a nice beat) AndyW
rocked the house early and Li closed up with a sweet set. However I think
is the night I started to come down with the cold that cut the dance
marathon short later in the week.

Day 5:
I am really ragged at this point. I take some of my non raver frenz to
Static and they were very freaked out ;) They were definately not
expecting that kind of crowd or muzak. I danced real hard to some really
tight jungle. I met up with Lauren G (Hi there!) and apparently there
were more SFR's that showed up but my frenz eventually wanted to go to a
bar that they were more comfortable at so we went bar hopping and ended
up playing pool in this empty Irish bar somewhere in the city. Aches and
sneezing had really set in by the end of the night.

Day 6:
I wanted to go danceing but there was no way my body would let me. I
posted this to the list and to my delight I got a lot of get well soon
emails =D Basically I went over to a frenz house and we watched South
Park  expecting to see who the fat kidz dad was but it was April Fool's
so they didn't show the episode (I don't really watch the show so I
wasn't too bothered but my frend was pissed) Didn't get much sleep but
whatever it was spring break.

Day 7:
I decided to save my energy for the weekend so went to see the Wedding
Singer (Hysterical fits of laughter caused by this movie) and again ended
up getting home VERY late that night. Since I worked a 40 week on Spring
Break I was going into work very haggard lookin in the mornings and it
was taking several injections of Caffeine to get me going (I was doing
Double tea bags per cup as tea has a higher concentration of caffeine
than coffee)

Stay tuned for the exciting conclusion that blew my mind and ended my
spring break like nothing else  ever could

  I may as well take the time to respond to this.

    Drugs are an integral part of the rave scene.  Whether we like to admit it
or not..  the scene would not exist without drugs.  They are there... they
exist.  I took this post as an insult.  I was not "guided" into the rave scene
and taught the "proper way" to view it all.  I came with my own preconceived
notions and my own experiences and I made what I could of it.

   Raving is not a huge movement to conform the masses.  We make it so
beautiful because of our differences.  and if that means being a sober raver,
or getting fucked up every weekend, it doesn't matter.  You can't tell someone
what to do.  You can only help them out and stand by them.  

Not every raver becomes an addict.  I don't deny that drug use is a big
problem in our scene.  But it is also an advantage.  It is part of the journey
you take when you go to a party.  To transform your entire way of viewing the
world and taking it away from the party with you.  

   Now I have to take time out to say this is not a flame.  I do agree with
AlwayzSpun (was that meant as a twist of irony? =)  We DO NEED MODERATION!! It
is a MUST.  You can take your CandE and your Psychedelics and other things,
but know that THey ARE harming you, and that if you do too much you are doing
damage to your body/mind.  I know there are those people out there who are
getting mad at me and saying "NO!! Drugs are a learning tool and they are
wonderful!!!"  Well, yes, they are. 
But they are also DRUGS.  And you have to be realistic and take responsibility
for the fact that you are altering your body, no matter how fun and good it
feels.  

(GRR can you all tell I'm practicing to grow up and be the Next Leslie??)  I
do drugs.  I'm not ashamed of it.  But you have to be smart about it and not
get too fucked up all of the time.  

There will always be new teenyboppers coming into the scene and getting
involved with the drugs.. because the drugs are there, and they are available.
And where else can you really get away with it so openly??  The question is
How can we stop it?? is there really a way to get to every new person that
enters the scene and open their eyes to sober raving?? And do we really want
to do this??  I think we should let everyone choose their own path and have
their own experiences.  THe most we can do is set an example.  Heheh... so
who's ready to hand over their drugz???

Gang warz...
In the 40'z, we had the Zoot Suiterz, and the Lindy Hopperz.
In the 60'z,Woodstock waz the most spectacular display
of human love and affection ever witnessed at one gathering
any where on the face of the planet. Oh yeah, the funky
concept of tie-dye waz invented at this point by the cool 
ass hippy'z.
In the 80'z, we were still reeling from the effects of the
disco dancin John Travolta and the one and only Soul Train.
This said era waz dominated by such comical characterz az
'Boy' George and Cindi Lauper. I don't know what to call
them, and let's not forget about Madonna'z rize to fame with
hits like Border line and Jimmy Jimmy. 
    Now entering the New Millenium, a new breed haz arizen.
Enter the Party Kidz. Underaged Adolescents staying
out way past every1'z curfew and cramming every conceivable
illicit substance down their throats and just trying to get
az fucked up az they can.
While we all have had our share of spending a whole night
drooling in the corner spun out of our mindz while attending
a phat party, most of us had the common sense to realize 
that this waz not acceptable behaviour to carry out on a 
weekly basis. But not the Rave Baby. Party Kidz are nothing
more than Rave Babiez who grew out of the habit of getting
az aced out of reality az they could only after they had 
hit rock bottom(getting strung out, lozing everything, and
only then realizing addiction to whatever poizon they had 
picked).
    Okay, so while some of us continued to get wasted, and 
otherz realized that wasted wazn't where it waz at, we still
have a new wave of party goerz entering the scene every month.
What impression are the newcomerz supposed to get about the
now clouded and confuzed scene?
Even in the magic mushroom dayz of the hippiez and the mystic
mescaline dayz of Heavy Metal viewerz, in the dayz before
LSD waz banned, people were not getting az fucked up az the 
Rave Babiez. Oddz are that any new gen-Xer entering the scene
now will partake of more controlled substancez within a 
month than the freelovin' swingin' sex-pressive hippiez of 
the 60'z did in 2 or more months. 
    However, with the help and aid of an experiened guide,
the guiding hand of an experienced party goer, new rave
babiez won't have to learn the true meaning of a rave the
hard way. I mean yeah sure,everyone wants to get a little
blasted and high az fuck, therez no problem with that. Ya
wanna hippy flip, cool... Candy flip, go right ahead, MX Missle,
Fire away, Coco puffs, I'm cuckoo, parachuting your thing,
feel free to do so.
What I'm saying iz that there iz no need to try out 4 
different drugz at the same sitting. And I feel that this 
point iz not made clear for most first time raverz, who get
the obvious yet wrong impression about the type of thing to
do at a good party by nitro sucking shroom swallowing smoked
out speed snorting e-kid laying in hiz own puddlez of urine 
and multicolored vomit... Get what I'm sayin?
    Misunderstand me not, I've been more than my fair share 
of high before, but I've never been incoherent and I've never
not known what I've just put in my body. I've also never put
hellacious amounts of entheogenz in my body.
I've heard of people taking 4-5 hits of E within the same 
2 hourz trying to 'Get Off' az best they can. Ten hits of
acid disappear down the same manz throat. Half an ounce of 
shroomz 'tween teo people... Or how bout the first timer
with their paycheck in their pocket on Friday night answering
to every call of 'X' and 'Fry', az well az getting taken by
the venderz and people selling other shit. Why not make
it clear from the beginning of the party that you're not
suppozed to get all fucked up beyond belief. I've recently
seen a flier that stated right on the front that G would not
be tolerated within its doorz. Its not much by itself, but,
its a great start for what it's worth. There iz nothing 
wrong with getting your high on, but be selective when
wasting the limited grey matter. You only have so much of 
it and you can only get so high at one time... No matter
how much pot you smoke, you'll only get so stoned. No matter
how many hits of E you take, you're gonna get spun. There iz
no need to take more than two hits of acid, you're gonna fry.
You don't need to eat more than two eigths of shroomz cuz 
you're still gonna get off. This iz the Point that so many
have difficulty understanding, sillly az that might be. I 
guess some assume that 20 hits of Fry will make you see more
than 2-3 hits will. Might be true, but you'll be just az 
fuckin incapacitated so what doez it really matter? Sure 
you will relive the sinking of the Titanic after 1/2 oz. of
shroomz, but you'll be so fuckin shroomed out that you won't remember
shit about sinling anyway. So maybe it will feel
8 timez az good to drop 4 hits of X instead of 1 or 1-1/2.
Who carez if you're E'n so hard that your teeth grind and 
no one can understand a fuckin word your sayin... 
     I guess this iz nothing more than a warning early 
Easter 98 mornin for the purpose of lettin y'all know some
one iz concerned with the posterity of the scene, and I do wish
to keep all my party peops alive until we're old and decrepit
haz been fart knockerz doin dancez in front of our kidz
like our parents do in front of us... But if we keep destroyin
ourselvez, by not watching out for each other, where will
we be in the near future. What will we have in the near future.
Sure I can down 40 geltabz and not sweat it, but can I 
eazily and clearly what I waz doin exactly what I waz doin
1 year ago? 
    If reading this made you scratch your head or set off
a warning light somewhere in the back of that partied out
teenage brain of yourz, Take a sec to look at your involvement
in the scene... How involved are you really? How much are 
you doing really? What do you spend on drugz really? How many
different 1'z are you on at your partiez? 
I'm exhausted and can no longer continue, so pleaze feel 
free to get back to me any time you pleaze...    
    Only cuz I care...

Forgive me but i dont keep up on the christian holidays
so im kinda ignorant about this easter thing.
So when he rises and comes out of his tomb,
and sees his shadow that means 6 more weeks of winter
and no shadow means spring is here...right? Or do 
i have that backwards?

OH MY GOSH!!!!


 Anybody who was at JUSTICE LEAGUE last night to witness the madness, was
definetly part of something magical. DARA, DEGO, REBEL, STRETCH (Usher acca.
over Shy FX's "Bambata"......Holy Sh*t!) and MC M.A.D. ripped the place
apart!!!! The combination of the music and the Full moon created a  vibe I
haden't felt in a while.....truly a landmark for those who know and those who
are now realizing the weight of Drum & Bass. (The Reprezent show set the pace
I think.)

 Much respect to all who showed and gave up the energy....STRETCH's set was
made so easy by the crowd response. 

 Big, big ups to XLR8R, MAGIC CIRCLE, & BUGGING OUT & the TERRORIST SOCIETY
for joining forces and making the night happen. We forsee more nights like
this taking place this Summer!!!!...........prepare.


Peace,
Noel

okay see this is my opinion on this issue at hand~
    see the thing with me is that  i totally understand what is being said
about not wanting to give off the wrong impression... but i also agree with
trice...the fact is that everyone percieves raving as how they want to that is
just the bottom line....
    as far as baby ravers go--- i think that no matter what if they want to do
the drugs and go all out no one is going to stop them and as they fall and hit
rock bottom it is a process that has to be done in order for them to take that
step up into the knowledge and understanding of not always having to be fucked
up to have fun.... that fall is what makes you realize that you don't need to
continue doing all the drugs and what not....
  and also nobody can talk to them and tell them don't do this because all of
my life i was taught what drugs can do to you from D.A.R.E to when i found out
half of my family members were drug addicts.....i knew what was going to
happen as i got wrapped up in the drug world... i knew that i was going to
fall but that fall is what made me stand up again and now i am content with
going to a party sobar and knowing that i am not going to be hella cracked in
the morning.. it is a great feeling and you learn to accept and like  it and
the only thing that helped me was falling and learning from that fall.....
   i will tell you right now that i will still do those drugs every once in a
while but you know.. i am so happy that i took my step up...and the thing is
that i beleive i have to fall before i stand up and learn....   so anyways...
okay love always Moonbaby--Jenn

well on friday night mike and his crew came out to sacramento and picked me
up. it was fun to finally meet him and his boys....:c)
we headed out to the party to find a huge line awaiting us....
so we got in and took a look around. this party was at a roller skating rink
and had 2 rooms.
the main floor was the roller rink part and the second room was kinda a snak
bar put on you roller skates area. 
the music was alright, iam not to into house (which was in the 2cd room) and
in the main room there were some good points, but not many. the bassbin twins
were pretty good and i danced for a little while. 
now here comes the venting part of my night.........
the sacramento scene is so diffrent....
to me the whole scene out here is based on *image* 
i havent been to a party out here in like 2yrs, and iam telling you that i
really dident enjoy it. 
it wasent like if you werent part of a 'click' then you dident fit in.
no one came up to you sat down and said hi iam so and so how you doing
tonight.
and yeah i dident go up to anyone and try to conversate because well they just
dident seem to friendly. 
all in all i dont think i will go to another sac party. its just not my thing,
i much rather come down to sf and kick it with all of you. 
the highlight of my night was meeting mike, steve, and derek....
they are defenitly some cool boys and i had alot of fun with them, even though
after about three hrs of the party me and derek went to the car to rest
because we were so wore out. i defenitly had fun meeting thease guys and
chilling with them friday night.
mike....you are such a great guy, thanks so much for picking me up and haning
out with me!
steve....you are really cool, you had the funniest experession on your face in
the coffee shop, hope we can hang out again
derek....thanks for talking with me about life, it was defenitly a great
night!
thanks for letting me listen to you mix tape too (yo guys you gotta check out
this boys tape, it is really nice)
well there was my 2 cents on the whole thing, hope everyone had a good
weekend!

love...
amanda

Hey, how come no one has been posting about this party last night yet?  I had
expected a lot of responses about F8, and it is 8:00pm already, and not
one.... I guess every one is doing the holiday thing. 

I would just like to say that this party was one of the best parties in A LONG
TIME!!  

*Perfect amount of people ..
* Spectacular vibe, all around, every where.
* Great music, 
* Did I say Great music? ! 
* There was a lot of SF ravers.... I probably didn't even me all ya'll.
 Yes, I had a wonderful time, I hope there are more parties like the way this
one turned out.  I guess it all has to do with what you bring to the party to
share with others.  There was so much *ENERGY* there.  At one point during the
party, as I looked around me, EVERY ONE was dancing.  The whole house was
jumpin' up with the music, and even screaming with enthusiasm.  What a great
feeling, let me tell ya!!  
	It is amazing what music can do to you, the emotions it stirs up inside of
you.  Just from listening.  Music is a blessing.  It can raise conciousness
every which way, if you allow it to.  Hmm, well what did those of you who
attended think?? 
Alright, Happy Easter every one-
*Lisa*

I heard there was a mass alien abduction and it has taken a little 
more time than expected for our government to wipe their
memories clean of the event. Im sure they will
be back soon to report that they were never abducted, never debriefed by
our government and in fact had a wonderful time at one of the best 
partys ever.

going to be here in LA for Space Park on May 16.  Hope you can make it.
I just happen to be listening to Mystre's latest tape right now.  Helps
me think and plan.  Those guys are gonna blast . . .

Ok, so there was Saturday night and I had nadda to do. I was just going to
call it quits at about 10pm, cause I had no $$$ and didnt plan on partying. So
just out of curiousity, I looked on the calender to see what parties besides
the gathering and f-8 were going on. Then I saw this post for a party that was
up in the SantaCruz mountains. I just had to go check it out!  It was free to
get in if you brought a can of food for donation. So I picked up Jason@thin
from the list, who I must say is an awesome guy who can party!!!, and we
headed out for the map point. It was at this little market right on top of the
summit area off of 17.  The party took us waaaaay up summit road to the slide
areas with roadblocks. The flyer said to just look for a bunch of cars and
park. So we found the place and did just that. We brought blankets and snacks,
wish was good thinking because it was heeeeellla cold and there was no food or
anything there. 

The vibe there was excellent, and when they finally got the generator started
and cables ran, it went off for the next 9 or 10 hours!!!! The music was so
awesome, really great trance and I think some goa trance too, then a jungle
set in the morning by this one girl who knew exactly what our ears needed!!!
The spot was cool, just right there in the middle of the road, because from
the point of the party and on, it was closed the rest of the way. It was a
little muddy, and as the peeps at Santuary today, my shoes were caked in it!
They had some hot chai(yum) and set up really cool tarps and chill areas. The
spot was pretty dark, and I couldnt see much in the night. This one girl took
me to see the most beautifull water fall up there, my eyes were just locked in
the flow of the water and sound of the whole area there. The party just
continued to go off, and it was still kind of going at around 8:30 when I
left. We got to see the most beautiful sunrise, with not a cloud in the sky.
We just all sat and watched mystified by the beauty of it all.......then I got
to see more of the space in the daylight, and it was prettier than I had ever
imagined!  The waterfall was so full of life and color, it was all so perfect.
I met Cat weasel, briefly, and Sukreta ( I know that isnt spelled right =(   ,
and she was a total sweeatheart. Then went to Jasons place and crashed for
about 3 hours, and off to sanctuary. I really wanted to have my mind and heart
more into it than it was, but I was so cracked that I just kind of sat and
chilled and didnt do a lot. But as always the sanctuary regs.  showed up with
smiles and good vibes. All in all, it has been a AWESOME 24 hours,....but
tomorrow its back to the daily crap....until VIBERATION!!!!!!  I will se you
all there! I hope every ones weekend has been as fun or more fun than mine.
Love you all, and party safe. 
W/Love&Harmony**and hugs!

scene.... especially the positive aspects?

welp ... i am just now winding down my weekend so i figured it is about time
i reviewed Frequency-8 ... this saturday was a special occasion for me as i
was planning to take my crew from work to their first rave ... they had been
asking about that "rave thing" i do for a while and i had promised them that
i would have to find the right party before i brought them into the scene
...

this saturday felt right and at the beginning of the week i started planning
the event ... all the guys would be in town and "the gathering" was going on
in SF and from looking at the lineup i figured this was the party to take
them to ... haze had decided to go to Frequency-8 but given that i wasnt too
hot about Ethan and DRC i decided not to join her (i changed my mind about
that later ;-) ) ...

i wanted my buddies to hook up with some sfravers before we got to the party
so that the culture shock would not be too intense ... so around wednesday i
sent out an invite for a south bay pre-party dinner ... the response to the
dinner invite was lukewarm but some of the usual suspects replied back and i
was able to get a nice crew of 50% sfravers + 50% newbies for dinner on
saturday evening ...

saturday morning came around ... i had been out doing the bar scene the
night before and on a minimal amount of sleep i started saturday at 10am ...
i got the CD player in my car replaced as the one i had purchased the week
before sucked the big one (it was an alpine - the new one is a clarion and i
love it) ... some of you from the south bay have probably heard of the
depression i went through when my old CD player died on a sunday as i was
headed to Nick's bbq ... now that i have the new one, driving my car isnt as
traumatic anymore ... thank god ...

the installation shop happened to be right next to solid grooves and i
dropped by there to pick up the tix to the gathering and to get my weekly
fix of import CDs ... i got home to find email from haze urging me to
reconsider the gathering as i would be the only one going there and because
Mars & Mystre kick ass ... decisions, decisions ... i changed my mind a
couple of times on her but i finally agreed to go to F8 if i could get a
refund on my tix for the gathering ... the solid grooves boys had no
problems with giving me a refund and so the decision was made ...

i picked up haze and nico and we arrived at chilli's at around 7:30pm ... i
then took a quick drive by solid grooves and got the refund and i was back
at chilli's by 8pm ... my buddies were already there but most of the south
bay crew was a no show ... finally andrew and rick saved the day by showing
up and we got to sit down for dinner ... soon after that michael and marq
joined us and we all had a great little dinner together ...

rudi, is that review coming up anytime soon ? yup here we go ... ;-)

we headed for oakland at around 10pm and arrived at the location at around
11pm ... we walked into the party to some "hard core" trance by greg sandler
... the visual candy was just amazing inside the main room ... they had this
huge ass lazer which spanned the ceiling ... each room also had a huge
fluorescent pyramid hanging off the ceiling ... as i stepped into the main
room i realized that this was going to be a party to remember ... the party
had this "je ne sais quoi?" atmosphere that promised many marvelous
experiences to come ... you could just feel the vibe in the room seeping out
of the walls and from the people ...

my buddies were in shock to find out that no alcohol would be served and for
a while they were a little uncomfortable in the new environment ... mostly
they were just standing around checking out the visuals and the crowd and
getting accustomed to the loud music and to receiving hugs from strangers
... haze and I brought every sfraver we could find to meet with them and
slowly the uneasyness started to wear off ...

i couldnt help getting on the floor to shake my booty thing as the music was
so intense even though the evening was just starting ... i left my crew in
the very capable hands of haze and i took off for musical bliss ... DRC came
on fairly soon after we got there and she just tore the house up ... i had
heard her set at another party a while back and i really didnt like it but
she kicked some serious rudi booty with this set !!!! ... a couple of the
newbies soon got adventurous and decided to venture onto the dance floor to
my delight ... DRC's set was also fairly hard core but i was totally into it
... you could tell that she was into the music that she was spinning as she
danced to it and that she was connected to the crowd as she "communicated"
with us - you'd have to experience one of her sets to understand what i mean
by that ...

next came mystre ... he toned down the music a little bit by playing more
"melodic" trance which is my favorite type of trance (actually that is the
only type of trance that i like) ... the peaks and the valleys in what he
spun took me on a magical journey ... it was so intense that i would find
myself just standing there with my eyes closed sucking in the music ...
intense ... then the music came to a stop ...

next came the voice of mars (???) who thanked everybody for showing up and
urged us to keep the vibe alive ... and then the most intense moment of the
evening came for me as the music started again and the remix of underworld's
"dark and long" came on - it was so intense that i didnt know whether to
jump of joy or start crying ... i chose to jump of joy ... mars increased
the hard edge of the trance that he played through his set which was fine by
me ... he also had an excellent set totally living up to his reputation ...

finally Ethan came on ... he took the trance back to the "hard core" level
and so i didnt get into the set as much ... also i was starting to feel the
fatigue from 5 hours of non-stop dancing and very little sleep ... the
evening ended in an extra track thrown in there by Mars ...

after waiting for michael to find his car keys we left oakland ... as i was
listening to one of the CDs i picked up at solid grooves the day before i
discovered that i had the same track that Mars started his set with ... i
was ecstatic about that (no pun intended) ... i have been listening to that
track non-stop all day now and every time the music reaches its peak i go
back to the party and find myself surrounded by people who love music as
much as i do ... i believe the track is by Underworld and it is called "dark
and long (dark train mix)" - at least that is what the CD cover says ...

things turned out pretty good for my crew ... 3 of them will definitely join
us for a rave again soon :-) ... the two others will be left home as they
definitely cannot handle being up all night or dancing without being drunk
for that matter ...

i want to thank all the sfravers who hung out with us last night for
embracing my crew so warmly ... this definitely helped to enhance their
experience and make this an awesome first party for them ... even the ones
that couldnt handle the late night/dancing were impressed by the scene and
the party ... this is what raving should be about !!!!

i am not going to list everybody that i saw at the party last night ... i
would probably forget some of you and that would make me feel totally bad
... you all know who you are and i know what you look like ;) ... i love you
all - thank you for making my weekend ...

also much respect to the hazemeister for once again choosing the right party
for me to go to ... i'll try to trust your judgement a little bit better
next time gurl ... also thanks for taking care of my buddies and introducing
them to everybody ...

i got home at around 8:30am and i took a quick eye rest (that would be me
lying in bed with my eyes closed without sleeping) and then headed out to
golf with my crew ... i scored a 64 on a par 30 (9 holes) - i suck but i
enjoy playing no matter what ... also that was an improvement for me as i
scored a 69 last week :-) ...

after golf and a late lunch/early dinner i joined the south bay family at
DjNick's place for the bbq ... unfortunately the weather got threatening and
so we decided to shut it down early ... the gang that was there (once again
you know who you are and i am not naming any names to protect the guilty)
decided to have a south park viewing marathon as i was leaving ... i hope
you guys had fun ... it is now 11pm and i am still trying to get motivated
to do my taxes ...

all in all an awesome weekend brought about by the wonderful community of
ravers that we are blessed to have in the south bay !!! thank you all so
much !!!

if you've read all the way down to here i send you much respect and good
vibes ... actually you get mny good vibes even if you deleted this piece of
mail after the second paragraph ;) (obviously you wouldnt know that if you
didnt come all the way down to here) ...

until next time, peace and really loud music,

Rudi

In a message dated 98-04-12 22:31:29 EDT, you write:

<< the sacramento scene is so diffrent....
 to me the whole scene out here is based on *image* 
 i havent been to a party out here in like 2yrs, and iam telling you that i
 really dident enjoy it. 
 it wasent like if you werent part of a 'click' then you dident fit in.
 no one came up to you sat down and said hi iam so and so how you doing
 tonight.
 and yeah i dident go up to anyone and try to conversate because well they
just
 dident seem to friendly.  >>

I am trully sorry that you didn't have good time in sacramento.  Speeking as
someone who has lived here for just about all my life I have to say I agree
about our scene being different but we really aren't unfriendly, honest.  That
sucks that no one came up to ya but well it's like this everyone in sacramento
just about knows everyone else so I think that's one of the reasons that
people jsut don't go around introducing themselves.  I must also say you chose
a pretty shady party to make your return debut to the sac scene.  Welp I guess
i'm tring to say don't cancel us out of your future plans cuase we really are
nice people, at least me and my friends are.  And I hope you come down
tooparty with us again sometime:)

major correction - i might be wrong about that track ... the CD i got the
name from is Pete Tong's Essential Selection - I think the name of the track
is actually called "Treat Infamy" by Rest Assured ... maybe mars could
confirm ??

Hi all!  ]=}

 What a lotta fun!!  :) What I've always like about The Gathering events 
is the very diverse crowd they draw. I love gang-like kids and snotty 
socialites getting down on the floor together!  :)

 It was really nice to bust a move to Jeno (who was first up in the main 
room) with comfortable room on the floor!

 I was mostly in the "less thumps" room (I was working visuals and 
such). Nick Phillips was fun, Alex Patterson played some *very* 
interesting stuff but also some, ahm... unapproachable (for me) type 
stuff. He did keep things interesting but I felt his segues were a bit 
rough without smoothness. Loved dancing to some of it tho.

 Joe Rice was an interesting contrast and very enjoyable as I wound down 
getting ready to pack my gear at the end of the night.

 Maritime Hall was lacking a bit in TP and hand towels. If they are 
going to kick us out at 4 AM the least they can do is keep the bathrooms 
well stocked.

 There was some sort of Power Exchange/Fetish party in the basement and 
a few of those folks made their presence known on the dance floor.

 Great work by Martin and his crew!!!!!  Much love and respect to the 
The Gathering's crew!!  :)

mad hugz,

Ran D. Dreams

perhaps some of you are familiar with _Sky_--he's a techno musician and
something of a celebrity down in l.a...

anyways, skyebaby and i are just flat-out fascinated by that whole Disney
(tm) remix thing he did and the equally interesting legal snarl he got in
with old Uncle Walt's corporation that makes all his stuff generally not
for sale.

to cut to the chase:

does anybody have, in any format, any of Sky's various works (e.g., his
drum n' bass remix of _When You Wish Upon a Star_, etc.)?

this is more skyebaby's thing than mine, as i think Looney Tunes schools
Disney any day of the week, so contact her at:

XxxMWAHxxx@aol.com

i guess you can contact me, too, but then you run the risk of me writing
back to you and well we all know how that one goes.

hmmmm...I guess this wasn't so bad...except for all those damn sfravers I
kept running into

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

This party KICKED ASS

	First of all, had I known I was going to enjoy the music so much, I would
not have worn my beetlejuice outfit.  Those friggin striped tights and
swishy skirt are so damn cool and my go go boots are kickin, but
hellllllllyyyyyun you don't want to be wearing them to dance 5 hours
straight!!!!  Sigh.  Oh well, I still danced til my toes hurt and next F8
party I will know better : )  
	Lacie-gurl got us to our spot and I went in with her to see a bunch of
sfravers already there.  We packed the place guys!!! It was tony-the-tiger
great. When Dina first came in we were just hanging and walking around a
bit....it was already hot in there and it did get MUCH HOTTER as the night
wore on.....I noticed there were so many people groovin already when I
first got there.  I didn't see hardly anyone standing around.  As I "hung"
I couldn't help bouncing around for two reasons:  the first set was really
cool for me because there was this tribal drum thing going on and I REALLY
have a thing for drums!! the other is that everyone was dancing and dancing
is contagious for me : )
	Dina, not being much of a dancer, wanted to find other sfravers so we went
on a little jaunt and found most everyone: Haze and Rudi and Co., Natasha,
Lacie, Josh, Scott, oh there were so many!!  I kept seeing people all night
and it felt really good almost like I knew everyone at the party.  The
music just kept happening and happening for me....I would dance and dance
and the crowd would just absolutely go wild (I especially noticed this when
DRC was spinning) and later when Mars and Mystere were doing their thing it
would totally happen again although I was almost in that "trance dance"
state by then and kind of unaware of much going on around me.  Except my
feet hurt.  That was a bit of a distraction dammit. 
	Later I got really tired and Dina was going back and forth because she
wasn't in dance mode that night (partly because she had a no-effect
experience), even though she loves trance more than anything, but she
didn't really want to leave to go back to reality. So we listened to music
for a while and it was cool....then we started to think about driving
home....and thought more....and then, well, I guess it was just time to go.

Love you all!  

Terri

WEll.. my spring break is off to a slow start.  I made it out to neither
theGathering or F-8, although I'm more bitter about missing the latter.  Glad
to hear it went so well.. I really wish I could have been there.  The only
thing I did this weekend (besides bum around with my ravah friends and start
turning my house into a hotel) was head down to Sanctuary.  Since I've never
gone down there before, I wasn't sure what really to expect,but it was fun.
It's laid back things like that that make the end of the weekend fun.  Just
wanted to say thanx to Nick for letting us use his
house/yard/tables/barbeque/phone  and for feeding us.  Oh!! and for pushing me
around the parking lot in a shopping cart.  And thanx to Mook for putting up
with my lovely trainwrecks on the turntables.  ANYONE who let's ravers have
free reign of their yard like that has to be cool.. and so this my thank you.
Ok.. heheh Hopefully next weekend will be more action packed and I'll see you
all soon!

hugs n'stuff,
trice the tekno diva

Hey kidz,

I need input. Heres the skinny. The turntables are
built into a stationary unit and everytime the place
starts jumping the needles start skipping. (We have
tried all types of needles by the way!) They are
resting on like three inch foam pads already and have
been for like 5 years (upstairs Sound Factory). Since
I can't get anyone off their asses to suspend them, I
thought I would ask for your ideas.

They are set in a wood enclosure and sunken so that
top of the table (not the platter) is even with the
top of the enclosure. (picture downstairs at 1015)
the edges aren't touching and its deffinately coming
from the floor moving whilepeople are jumping up and
down. I have tried like closing off three feet around
the front of the DJ Booth but nothing seems to be
working. 

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Please respond
privately as not to spam the list as a whole.

Thanks
Layne

There is a difference between seeing a rave and becoming part of the 
rave itself. I'm not referring to actually planning the party...but the 
subtle line between hearing the music and feeling the music..where the 
vibe picks you up sober and leaves you with a tranquil feeling as if 
this is enough in its self. 

Lisa is so right. There was a point where the whole crowd was going...no 
lurkers no watchers. a unity. Ahh! It was an amazing experience. I had a 
really great time.

DRC is a true definition of 'grl pwR'. That woman blows me away. And of 
course mars & mystre we amazing...ethan roked but I don't think I got to 
hear greg sandler (strike that reverse... maybe I heard greg and not 
ethan....hmmm....) anyhoot: I was in 'absorb everything mode' and just 
enjoyed the vibe and people. I once said I'd never party @ 2nd/jackson 
again (ok so I said it last week =0) but it really reminded me that its 
not the space that makes it groovy its the groovy people who make it!

OH & HI O::to all the kewl and funky people i got to party with and hi 
to all the new people i met and who's names I've inevitably forgotten! 
you rule! and hi to all the regular kydes & SLOTribe. y'all...it was one 
to remember.

**re mem mem re mem  mem member freqency 8 great time together lauphin 
and dancin doin whatever, we liked best what ever the weather** 
--->ok no more kamp songs :o) 

that's my re-VIEW ... so have a krazy mad day!

its a sparkleberry kind of day :o)

LaCie.

"Learn to enjoy every minute of your life.  Be happy now. Don't wait for 
something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future--Think how 
really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or 
with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed, savored."

something i found in the paper today...

 

             New loft residents target SoMa clubs 

             By Emily Gurnon
             and Tyche Hendricks
             OF THE EXAMINER STAFF 

             IT COULD BE called this year's version of "The Sound and
the Fury."

             Growing friction between South of Market residents and
area nightclub owners has prompted
             police to step up patrols in the 11th Street corridor and
try to shut down the popular VSF club.

             As more people have moved into live-work spaces and
condominiums in the neighborhood, the
             clubs and their customers have been the target of written
complaints, a lawsuit and crackdowns
             by police, club owners said.

             "We really don't have a problem with the Police
Department if we don't have housing," said
             Robin Reichert, owner of the Paradise Lounge and
Transmission Theatre.

             The 11th Street club corridor is the latest flash point
in the debate over The City's hottest
             development craze -- the explosion of loft housing,
called live-work by planners, taking place
             in the formerly industrial South of Market neighborhood.

             Club owners say the police presence is just the latest
sign that they are being edged out of their
             neighborhood by residents whose large real estate
investments make them unwilling to put up
             with the noise and rowdiness that the clubs sometimes
bring.

             To the residents, more patrols mean a better chance that
the rules will be enforced.

             "What we object to is one club in particular," the VSF,
said Gail Goedinghaus, who lives
             kitty-corner from the nightclub at 11th and Folsom
streets. "If he would only operate according
             to his permits, we wouldn't have a problem."

             Formerly the Oasis, the VSF has generated numerous
complaints from nearby residents, said
             police Capt. Dennis Martel.

             Other residents have complained about neighboring clubs.
But unlike the others, the VSF has a
             dance hall permit that allows it to operate beyond 2 a.m.

             What Goedinghaus and her neighbors hear is "a very loud
heavy bass beat that sounds like a
             'thump thump thump' coming out of this club," she said.
"It rattles the windows on the fourth
             floor of the building where I live, and these are
double-paned windows. If you can imagine,
             it's very hard to sleep. It's the kind of sound, it gets
into your brain. It penetrates everything."

             To her partner's 10-year-old daughter, "it sounds like a
T. rex or something walking down the
             street," Goedinghaus said.

             In the past 15 months, police have documented 21
different incidents -- ranging from assault to
             noise to drug possession -- that triggered a resident's
complaint or a visit by police, Martel
             said. The department will attempt within the next several
weeks to suspend or revoke VSF's
             permits, he said.

             $60,000 for soundproofing 

             Club owner Kevin Murphy said the VSF is a "pretty good
neighbor." He spent $60,000 last
             year to install more soundproofing. He also hires
homeless people to clean up outside every
             morning and tries to work with the residents and police
to address problems, he said. But he
             feels the cooperation is one-sided.

             "The way in which it's coming to me, it's more like a
witch hunt," Murphy said. "It's like,
             'You're causing noise; we're going to shut you down.'

             "OK, people want to sleep. We need to help here, but it
is an industrial area. I'd like to see
             some of the residents that have moved in here take some
amount of responsibility for the
             decision they've made. I didn't move into their
neighborhood. They moved into mine."

             The we-were-here-first argument is a common one South of
Market, where club owners feel
             increasingly threatened by their new neighbors.

             Several club owners wrote the city Board of Permit
Appeals, pleading for a reconsideration of
             the board's approval of a new 15-unit live-work space on
Harrison Street near 11th. The
             nightclubs lost; the project received the go-ahead.

             "It is unreasonable and unfair for businesses such as
ours, which have been established for
             longer than some of these tenants have been on Earth, to
have to constantly deal with a
             situation which should never have happened," wrote Bill
Herrmann, owner of the Holy Cow
             on Folsom. "It would be different if the area was
residential and the clubs moved in, but this is
             not the case."

             If more housing is allowed to move in, "We'll all go by
the end of next year," said Reichert,
             the Paradise Lounge owner.

             No new clubs allowed 

             The area is zoned for mixed use, meaning both housing and
light industrial development are
             allowed. Since a zoning change in 1990, new nightclubs
have not been allowed in the area, and
             the existing ones need to have all required police
permits to stay in business, planning officials
             said.

             Meanwhile, the number of lofts has mushroomed from 58
built in 1991 to 617 built or under
             construction in 1997. The housing boom in the mixed-use
area has caused much of the
             conflict, club owners and their supporters said.

             Problems that may have gone unnoticed by police in past
years, such as rowdy patrons, now
             attract the attention of residents. They, in turn, call
police.

             Clubgoers "get boozed up and they make a lot of noise and
they don't always have respect for
             the residents of the area," Martel said.

             "Not only do you have this music going on, but you have
all this street life that goes on until 4,
             5, 6 in the morning," said Felix Rodriguez, who lives on
11th Street between Folsom and
             Harrison.

             Rodriguez said the problems are limited to the VSF.

             "We're talking about violent fights in the street,
yelling," he said. "People who come here,
             their attitude is basically, anything goes here." On one
occasion, Rodriguez said he saw three
             or four men pull a parking meter out of the ground in
front of his building. Others urinate in
             doorways, throw beer bottles and rev their motorcycle
engines, he said.

             Police can enforce laws on public drunkenness, disturbing
the peace and traffic violations.
             They can force club owners to follow city laws and run
their establishments in an orderly
             fashion to avoid problems with the community, Martel said.

             Adapt to inner-city life 

             Many of the partyers themselves have little sympathy for
residents.

             "If you're moving into the inner-city area, then you have
to adapt to the inner-city life," said
             Tom Parsons, a New Zealander living temporarily in San
Francisco who stopped by the 20
             Tank Brewery on 11th Street last week.

             "People need to be a little more selective in where they
choose to live," said Paul Schuman,
             Parsons' roommate. "They need to research it before they
move in."

             Andrew Schmidt worked at 20 Tank three years ago and now
is a bartender in the Mission
             District. He is scornful of new residents who complain
about noise.

             "They were fools, I think (to move in here), because this
is South of Market," he said. "It's a
             hotbed for investment and that makes people make quick
decisions. They don't think. If you
             want quiet, live by the beach.

             "South of Market's history was always rowdy," Schmidt
continued. "People drag race
             motorcycles, there's bands, and there's lots of drinking.
And where there's drinking, there's
             noise."

             Musician Pauli Gray, who performed at an open mike at the
Paradise last week, said he feared
             the complaints could shut down clubs that make San
Francisco unique.

             "Then you wouldn't have the music scene happening. What's
going to happen then?" he said.
             "We're going to lose the special character of this city."

it doesn't matter what they dress like in denver.  dress how you want 
to.  be the individual that you are because that's the most beautiful 
thing about this scene - a group of individuals coming together to enjoy 
something that we all love, the music.  this is the tribe.

Yea, FSOL LOVE to use samples from movies!!!  If you know the
"Lifeforms" album really well, watch the movie "Predator"
(a Schwartzenegger vehicle, but force yourself to endure), and
you will hear a PILE of samples that FSOL use!  

Fortunately, they don't use any Aaaahhhhnuld samples.

Cheers,
Steve.

If voting could change the system it would be against the law.

the back, the health people would take anyone who had to puke back
there m friend got sent back there by one of the security gaurds and
she saw 3 other people puking well just wanted to let you all know
cause someone was asking about that last week

Move into the 21st century and buy cd's  =)

Or create a new type of music that requires skipping.
Call it techno-chaos or something...just tell
everyone its the latest cool thing from germany
and everyone will demand that you skip all the time
or it could also be marketed as a new interactive
dance movemnent..."ok everyone lets
start jumping up and down so we can make the records skip"

i REALLY think that we should start a letter (or e-mail) writing
campaign to the board of supervisors and the mayor.  This is ludicrous
and should not be allowed to continue.

does anyone have the contact info for the above??

check the city of san francisco webpage...all the info is there but
warning, their staff obviously checks the mail...and rarely...
letters and actually showing up at public hearings on south of market
development would be much more useful..writing the guardian and sfweekly
or getting them to do a story is another possibility

Hmmmm....

I guess I've got a different review of that party...  so here's my .02 on the
whole dealio...  

Of the four peeps that went to the party, only 2 of us stayed longer than 2 or
3 hours... so since I had driven more than 2 hours just to get there (after
picking up some people) I wasn't about to let anything get in my way of having
a good time!!!  Most of the peeps I saw seemed either a little tight (as in
"wrapped too...") when I first got there, or were just (well... something else
then...) but as the party evolved, so did the vibe....  

My friend Steve and I both couldn't believe just how the party took off!  I
mean the whole thing did a 180!  I had people talking to me, and I saw so many
people having a good time that I think the Sac. scene definitely has
potential....  In short, I think I can  compare it to visiting "my cousin in
Omaha..."  (same name, same blood, same love, etc.  just different, thats
all...).  I really don't think it was worth 20 buckaroos... but I would
definitely go to another party there...!  

Peace. Out.

Hello all,

	Well this has been floating round in my mind for the past week so I'm
gonna get it out. Who up on this list are true GABBERS ??? I don't
really know many that like the Gabber/Hardcore sound, but I'm turning a
few people I know onto it. Is it just that everyone up in NoCal is so
mind fed with this House and Trance stuff that they can't handle the
speed ?? Oh well it's just a question that I wanted to ask..
And if any of you are Gabberheads then do ya have any Thunderdomes ???

Laters,

Drakonis

Ohhh...I am sooo sad! I worked hard to promote for the f-8 party, and then
ended up not being able to go. I stayed home, and had one of the worst nights
of my life. It sounds like everyone had such a good time to. Why is that when
I can actually "afford" to go, and really want to go.I can't, and it turns out
to be so good too. Damn it....ok, sorry for whining. I'm hoping that Vibe This
makes up for it...pleease oh please. ;-)
I hope that everyone had a good Easter and all.....and have a fun-filled week
(don't work too hard)
Take it easy
Love always,
Skyebaby

(Sunny using Molly's mail)

Thanks for posting this to the list.  We invited the media down last
Saturday night and had several TV stations and several print reporters
in the house.  We asked them (the media) to stand outside the club and
monitor the sound. In fact, one reporter standing outside VSF remarked
that he could hear The Paradise Lounge more so than VSF.  Mind you, he
was at VSF's front door.   We said just you wait.  Then almost like
clockwork the SFPD came careening around the corner and slammed on the
brakes right in front of us.  This cop gets out and briskly walks to our
front door to serve us with yet another sound violation.  Boy was he
surprised when all of these reporters said that they could hear the
clubs down the street more so than VSF.  Guess what, he didn't write the
club up. 

SOMA dance clubs are under attack.  First DV8 then The Trocadero, then
The Holy Cow and VSF last week. Big Heart City, 1015 Folsom & The Sound
Factory have been raided several times over the last few weeks and
received several write-ups from the ABC as well. Do you remember when SF
used to have raves then the police said no more and SF Raves stopped
over night? Ring a bell?  Welcome to the game.  

Besides promoting at VSF, I am also the owner of a bar in a totally
different neighborhood in SF. It's core clientele is 20 something's
young adults we have a DJ set-up in-house but close by 2AM.  I've owned
it for over 4 years now and we've never been raided by the ABC or the
police to date.  I asked my local station sergeant how come I was immune
while places like VSF & 1015 Folsom had to put up with these constant
raids.  He said, (off the record of course) The SFPD has decided that
after-hours clubs are a nuisance they attract the wrong crowd.  That
they (SFPD) think that most of the illicit activity in the city goes on
between those hours and if they can eradicate a businesses ability to
operate during those hours then no more problems. Bars are OK  they're
about "drinking."  Dance clubs attract a totally different element. 

But the Police are not the only problem.  The entire corridor is now
surrounded by lofts or live-work units.  In fact, the adjacent building
(shares a wall) to VSF was just converted from a storage warehouse to 4
premium loft units, each listed at $650,000.  No one has moved in yet
but it's a matter of time before someone does and can't sleep because
they share a wall with a nightclub and starts the whole process of
calling the police 10 times a night to stop the music.   VSF's owner has
owned the club for 15+ years now and he is quick to point out that the
clubs are not the only focus of the new loft owners.  2 blocks away a
family owned trucking company that has been in the neighborhood for 63
years is moving.  You see, they loaded their trucks between the hours of
2-6AM and were making too much noise for the loft units next door. 
While the police couldn't bust them for noise they could write them up
over and over for double parking.  That solved the noise problem
instantly.

The ownership and the promoters of VSF will obviously lose if they shut
the club but so will the local dance community.   Ask yourself if you've
ever enjoyed a night or day at any of the following parties: Stompy,
Spundae, Pablo's Sugar Shack, Sunshine Daydream, FTT's Ultra, Deep
Space, Bondage-A-GoGo, Raindance, Eye-Spy.   Who's next?

I just read the article again and especially enjoy the lady who says,
"What we object to is one club in particular, the VSF, said Gail
Goedinghaus, who lives kitty-corner from the nightclub at 11th and
Folsom
streets. If he would only operate according to his permits, we wouldn't
have a problem."  The reporter later writes,  "Other residents have
complained about neighboring clubs. But unlike the others, the VSF has a
dance hall permit that allows it to operate beyond 2 a.m."  

This same lady showed up at the front door a few weeks ago in her
bathrobe and slippers screaming to "shut the music off!" She kept
screaming "it's illegal to play music after 2AM!!!"  The owner
threatened to have her removed from the premises.  Turns out she had
just moved into the neighborhood 4 months earlier and says she didn't
even know that all of the clubs were clubs.  Duh. 

Thank you for letting me vent.

I don't think there being a big pile of trash and puke is a good
explanation for it smelling like trash and puke...

Does this strike anybody else as rather foul?

And what's up with using the jungle room as the puke room?  I don't think
junglists are the ones generating most of the vomit... it's those damn
trance and house people... (just kidding!).

                    ... cleanup on aisle seven...

(have these people ever heard of cleaning up really nasty stuff like that
DURING the party.. it's not glamourous, but it's the difference between a 
party that smells like yak, and a good event)

Ew.

Good good day.

Hooked up with Cole, at my house.  Then Pete came over and sold
me his kickin mixer!  Woo!  Eventually we got out of the house,
and headed for the Maritime Hall for tickets to the Gathering
before going to the Great American to see Trans Am.

Well, we needn't have gone to the Maritime, because there were
no ins and outs, as we deduced after much hassle and haggling,
so we went to the Great American, hoping we
hadn't missed Trans Am.  Fortunately, we only missed one song,
and tickets were only $8!  They were incredible!!!  Their drummer
(who also plays drums for Tortoise, I believe) was amazing!
Don't miss them if they come to your town -- trust me.

After the superduper Trans Am show, we had a pizza with extra
mushrooms (hold the pizza), and went back to the Maritime,
this time hoping we didn't miss Alex Patterson.  Unfortunately,
we had already missed a little, but still caught over an hour of
his set.  He was incredible!!!  And it was a good way to "digest"
our "pizza".  Alex waxed between IDM and ambient, all of which
was fantastic (if a little hard to keep up).

Then we went upstairs to the main room of Maritime, where the
bulk of the masses were.  It was crowded and hot and sweaty,
but the music was good, and the cool movies, posters, lasers,
lights, and all that made it worth braving the crowd.  But
not for long.  There was no room to shake it, so we went back
downstairs.

Joe Rice was on then, and he kept up the cool jams while people
lounged about on the floor, watched the acrobatics of the kids
in the dance circle (some of who were catching some serious air!),
dancing about in a more subdued fashion, or just standing about
watching the people.  I talked to some people (hey Ran D!), danced
some, and listened to the great choonz.  So so mellow and so so cool!!!

Unfortunately, the Maritime being what it is, they closed the
party down at 4am (there was an afterparty elsewhere, but we
decided to skip it), so we took off home.

But it was a great night of great music and I had a very mellow blast.

Steve.

My housemates and I used to have a music studio in our garage when we were
living in the suburbs.  We took care to keep the level low enough so that
someone standing in the street couldn't hear the music.  But then our
neighbor across the street complained to us (at midnight on a weeknight)
that the bass was making his walls vibrate.  Sound travels more easily
through solids than through air.  What was happening was that even though
the sound didn't travel through the air out to the street, it was
travelling through the earth across the street and making our neighbor's
walls vibrate.

In the case of VSF... If you are standing outside the club and cannot hear
the music, it is still very likely that the sound is travelling through the
ground and up through the walls of the neighboring buildings, causing their
windows to rattle.  Someone who is trying to sleep in one of those
buildings could conceivably be awakened by the vibrations that are
travelling through the walls in their apartment.

I'm housetrained, have a decent job, I'm not too loud, have my own decks, windsurf, party, chill, live, breathe and I'm not anally tidy nor messy as hell, and I get along with most anybody.
Thanking you.

Yeah but this is like the person who moves into a neighborhood a few blocks
from the airport and complians that the planes are making too much noise. If
the source of the noise was there first then it's your own fault for moving
into an uncomfortable environment. What these people are doing is the
equivelent of the airport tenants going to the airport and asking them not
to fly the planes late at night cuz they need to sleep. Ludicrous! If you
can't handle the noise, don't move into a noisy neighborhood.

I personally hate VSF, so if they go *I* won't miss it at all.

This also goes to show how when people band together (in this case the loft
owners), anything is possible.  If the rave community, and the people who
threw parties weren't so disorganized, and so concerned with self, this
might be able to be stopped.  However considering the long history, I am
would put my money with the loft owners.

That club does no service to the dance community.  The security is quite
overzealous (grabbing ladies out of line because of thier use of, er, lip
balm?), and the people who are a part of the club (not necessarily the
promoters) are , to say the least, underhanded.

Oh well.  At least there is still (for now), 1015, Townsend.  Perhpas VSF
will survive.  But they will do so without my help.

Good riddance.

Well maybe if you treated your patrons better (VSF), you might garner some
sympathy.  Unfortunately there are still other places that are just as good
to have a aprty at.

Time to close the roof on the sucka.  Like 1015 before ye, you too must

It was lost a long time ago.  There are only a few clubs with after hours
permits, the cab laws suck, and the clubowners could care less about
clubgoers and are in it for one thing: $$$'s (the drinks at VSF are some of
the highest in SOMA).

Anyway...this will be interesting if nothing else.

Dan,

On the for real, you have got to be kidding. If we can't even get together
for a vietnamese dinner what makes anyone think this loose band of ravers
can get together to do anything other than party.

The real issue for raver action is this:  What do you have to offer the
City?  You are not involved in the economic development , you do not own
property and are not (other than partying) contributing the the city's
coffers in a significant fashion.  You don't even vote!  Money talks, and
da Mayor listens to those with deep pockets.  Especially property owners
buying $350,000 lofts!

If I could count the times I wrote letters to the various Mayors about
after hours parties.  In any case, I doubt there will be any collective
action.  there are other clubs and other venues and other places (the East
Bay), to get a groove on.  Usually people will only move when their backs
are pressed against the wall and there is nowhere to go!  Dancing is
usually not enough to make people do anything other than look for the next
party at the next place.  Unfortunate but true.

In general ravers are a lazy lot, and not really motivasted by politics.
As Miss Kitty pointed out there have been other clubs (DV8 & The Oasis),
that havene;t survived, and you heard not a peep from the community.  Same
will happen to toher clubs as development interest with long dollars gobble
up every space in sight (until the next earthquake).

I hope that unlike myself and others you can motivate people to act
(although I do wish it was for some other club than VSF) and you can turn
the tide of history.  If that does happen and thier is a victory I hope VSF
does everyone a service and treats it's patrons like human beings, instead
of cattle to be pushed around.  If they do win they would do well to lower
the price of drinks at the bar, and tell thier overzealous security to ease
up and let people have some fun.

Good luck.

(I still hate VSF).

peace,
John

Hi Rave Friends,

        A friend of mine has asked me to post that he is looking to buy a
1500 watt generator.  He would prefer an American-made, electric-start unit
that is still under warranty.  If you or someone you know has one for sale,
please email back.

        If something in the above description does not make sense, ignore
it.  I don't know anything about generators, I'm just repeating what was
told to me.

Much love,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

this isn't really about VSF, but about ALL of the SOMA clubs and all
of the clubs/spaces left in SF.  The article states that 1015, the
trocadero and several other spots have been harassed as well.
Personally i don't go to clubs but maybe twice a year, but i will not
stand by and let this f*cked up city shut down dance venues to please
wealthy developers.

First VSF, then 1015, then what..the maritime....and any other spaces
that could possibly be used for a party.

Hey all!

I know people were thinking about picnicking, but I haven't heard anything
lately.  It's also been coooooooold out there, so..I was wondering if
anyone would like to do lunch at an INSIDE place. I have a place in mind,
that's not as expensive, nor as slow as Chevy's, kinda a fun place to sit
down and eat (I don't think they have veggie entrees however, anyone let
me know if this is a problem).  I was thinking about possibly Thursday, or
maybe next week.

Anyone interested?

(SUNNY on Molly's account)

I hear John.  The management & security @ VSF *DO* suck.  But in over 8
years of promoting I haven't met a club owner that I could actually call
anything more than a sour business acquaintance, much less a friend. 
The issue here is simple.  There's an agenda at work.

The chronicle ceased to write about the 11 ABC (Alcohol Beverage Control
Board) raids in the last 4 months!  These agents walk right through the
entire establishment and make everybody show their IDs.  One night they
even fanned out onto the dancefloor and stopped the dancing @ VSF. 
There have been undercover cops in the house every Friday & Saturday for
as long as I can remember.  Believe me, the security wouldn't be so
damned on edge if they didn't have the police all over them every
night.  If they don't react to something illegal & a cop sees it then
the club DOES lose it license.  It's a catch-22.

I can't argue what happened to John.  I wasn't there & that's been
hashed to the Nth degree on this list.  My argument right now is
simple.  THE SFPD IS TRYING TO STOP AFTERHOURS DANCING.  Like VSF or
not, a club that you DO like WILL be next.  If you could only hear some
of the shit that the police have said to us.  I mean, one time last
summer I lost my shit when a police officer told me that I didn't have
to worry because my party brought in the *right* crowd.  But they were
having a problem with the club's *Wednesday* hip-hop night.  That night
brought in the wrong crowd. Oh yeah, and the "tweaker freaks" on Sunday
nights.  This is *YOUR* police department.  

San Francisco will not issue anymore after-hours dance permits. So every
time one club leaves that's one fewer venue in which to hold a party. I
have some of the fondest memories of Spundae's @ DV8.  I can remember
several killer WICKED's @ The Trocadero.  The word is that King Street &
Townsend are next after the 11th Street Corridor.  Take a look
Townsend/King Street's location, just across the street from the new
ball park with lofts sprouting up around the place like mushrooms. Where
are we going to hold "dance parties?"

Somewhere along the line we were forced to transfer a lot of the medium
that we call raving into club venues.  In other cities the dance scene
exists only in clubs. When there cease to be any afterhours dance clubs,
well what then?

While I am much more of a "Club Kid" than say a "raver"
I think Dan has a big point. This is my thing and
I maybe hit raves up once or twice a year. So its sort
of opposite, but we all stand for the same principle. 
The freedom to express ourselves through song and
dance.

Its not just clubs either! My good friend was on
the channel four news the other night because her
wedding store (its been in SOMA 15 years) is being
run out because of these high cost work/live lofts
going up. She has spent her lifes savings and all
her time and energy on this store. They are running
people out of their leases so they can build more
expensive lofts and they just find ways to run you
out. With the new Baseball field going up your going
to find that this will be happening all over SOMA and
its going to affect people you know.

Exactly! Its not whether VSF is run properly John,
thats not the point I think we are making. Its that
folks are being run out of they're lively hood so
someone else can profit. Personally I think it sucks.

for all of those out there that are fans of slowdive, my bloody
valentine, seefeel, loveliescrushing, etc... 
(shoegazey-airy-ambient-experimental sort of stuff)

i would _highly_ recommend checking out this show!

i caught -sweet trip- last time that they played at the justice
league...  and i was pleasantly surprised!  it's so rare to find an
actual band that performs this type of music live, much less one with
talent! 
i haven't heard any of the other artists that will be performing...
but i'm sure they're worth at least checking out!

*i am not affiliated with any of these artists...  just think that
sweet trip was amazing and want to spread the word and support their
scene!

Favor time...

Could someone look deep into their heart and pick up a ticket for me
for Vibe This, this Saturday?  Can't make it in time to any of the
places selling presale tickets and I'll be cranky if I can't get in.

Hell, I'll even let whoever picks one up for me add on some handling
fee just like the big boys do.  Of course I'll think you're a rat
bastard, but I'll still let you do it.

Thanks

whoah!  a d&b remix of "when you wish upon a star"!?!  i have _got_ to
get a copy of that.  did he do any other disney remixes?

i am totally fascinated by disney.  the guy was a freak - i mean,
anyone who popsicles themselves is cool in my book...  disney is
interesting to me because, on one hand he represents everything i hate
about america - corporate consumer culture, family values, etc, plus
he was completely conservative politically.  but at the same time,

The maritime hall has 'MAJOR' problems with all the lofts that they just
built across the street from them.   all the complaints from them severely
limit the activities at the maritime hall.   And now more are being built.

The maritime has been petitioning for a special permit that will allow them
to go till 6 am, but with all these residents complaints, they are now more
worried about keeping their 4 am permit.

At Feel Good Friday (last friday), we used the back side outdoor area as a
small chill space and had it all covered up, this was not alowed, but as a
personal favor, we were able to do it.  And in the middle of the nights,
some old rechity bitch from one of the lofts across the street came over and
nagged about how this was not allowed, and that it was noisy, and
disruptive.   She had a real nasty mouth on her.   Obviously she was rather
irritated by all the commotion that the maritime, sound factory, and street
traffic with the bay bridge off ramp.   its does get rather noisy at that
intersection.   The manager came out and kissed her ass like she was Donald
Trump or something like that.   It was rather embarrassing, cause I was
going at it with her at the time about how she shouldn't have moved in here
if she didn't like the noise, and that this isn't going to change, so she
had better get used to it, and change her attitude, or get a night job.    I
didn't care about her self centered, egotistical bitching, but the
management at the maritime sure did.

These residents have all the club owners on the run.   There running in
circles trying to do and say whatever it takes to appease these idiot
wanabee yuppie fuck ups.

I was told, that at large events, they even pay for hotel rooms for some of
the very irritating neighbors, just to ge them out of their hair for the
night.  Can you believe that shit?

Keep it real..   Vlad

I know the people who comprise Sweet Trip.  They are very pleasant folks. 
Viet, the bass player & the gent who occassionally posts to sfraves, was
key in getting me my live gig at the Justice League as part of Glad Hand
#2 back in January. The other two are Valerie (vocals/guitar) and Roberto
(vocals/guitar/programming, also produces **EXCELLENT** drum'n'bass under
the moniker Busheeloop--very sincerely highly recommended--can't say
enough about this guy's stuff).

ST just released their first full-length album on Darla
Records..."halica/bliss out v.11" is the title. Again, very highly
recommended...gives you the sonic depth that often doesn't come across
fully in a live setting.

These people rock, because they are fully into this for the love of the
music, no pretentions or BS...not to mention the fact that the music is
excellent.

Highly recommended.

Urban Legend... Messiah Wannabe.... he wasn't Kryogenicized... (sp?) I've
done some research into the topic and that is one of the first things they
state. His flesh was burried at Forrest Lake in LA. Also, he could have
been convertly dressing/acting to society like what you've mentioned, but don't 
you think it'd be necessary for his *Magic* to flow through society?? If
you're going to hang with the romans, you have to act like the romans.. :) 
Everyone in one way or another does this... acts like they want to be
percevied... to move forward their purpose and message.... Jesus was a
carpenter as the story goes.... but do you think his mental compacity was
that of a carpenter? Not to put down carpenters at all, because I think
carpenters are very intelligent. But the consciousness of Jesus was far
beyond any comprehensible Earth job.. and he had to take a career

very subject...  ;)

i was a carpenter for a while...

the problem with working as a carpenter but having a "conciousness far
beyond any comprehensible Earth job" is that you tend to make scary
mistakes, like tagging your hand with the nailgun...


> and he had to take a career
> change of sorts... :) 

me too - to the computer industry.  can't fund a worldwide ministry on
$9/hr.

personally i'm thinking i'll use my computerjob to fund a imported
erotic art store, franchise it, then funnel the billions i make into a
giant erotic-religious themepark.  or something like that...

(if i were still a carpenter, i would have just nailed my hand to the
wall again...)

...UNDERGROUND...

I can't wait!  Map points leading to map points!  No steroid-amped
security!  DJs booked because of their skill, not because of their name!
Festivals in the wilderness lasting several days!  Negative pressure from
authorities shaping ravers into a powerful force for good!

and most of all, an end to this nasty schism between the 21-and-overs and
those who ain't.

well, i just called the trance & jungle factory in berkeley to find out
until when presale tix for viberation would be available and they told me
they arent even selling tickets

im not going to make it into the city until saturday morning and i
absolutely must get into this party at all costs. anybody know where
presales are available for sure and for how long?

by the way, i was just up there for f-8 this past saturday and had the most
wonderful time. was feeling a little bit burnt out on raving and this party
gave me back faith. the energy was consistent throughout and spread across
the entire room. i havent felt anything like that in much too long. thank
you to all the people that were there and made it such a great time. i
didnt meet any sfravers because im so damned shy and i dont know who
anybody is, but i understand they were all over the place. i met rudi near
the end though, but i dont think he remembers me. i was the skinny asian
guy with buzzed hair wearing a blue t-shirt that said: onE and sporting big
green cargo pants. i brought a bunch of glowsticks with me and gave them
all out. what a nice feeling that pieces of me were spread all across the
room (id danced with each pair of glowsticks for a little bit before giving
them away)

the music: god, i dont even know how to describe it. hopefully that will be
enough to convey my enjoyment of it. drc blew my mind, so did mystre, mars
i didnt like all that much (very pretty tracks, but i didnt feel he had
much of a sense of building a set, or maybe i was just really tired by
then), who was the last guy, was that ethan? whoever it was kicked ass.
sounded like really minimal but hard trance. the first guy was wonderful
too, greg sandler?

this is an experience i will always remember. i hope whoever of you guys
was there also enjoyed it. looking forward to being up there for vibe this
again this saturday

joe

Speaking of stars, and disney....on paulina taylor's tape smile, it starts out
with "its a small world" and then....goes off into...(hum along if ya know
it:):)....so if you see the stars tonight, then tell me what they say, and let
me know how bright they are and i will always pray, that one day you'll come
down to me, my angel from above, the one i've always dreamed of , the one i'll
always love........
and also........i wanna see a rainbow high in the sky, i wanna see you and me
on a bird flying away, and then i hope to see your smile every nite and day,
i wanna make love to you, lead you to tomorrow, i wanna feel the sunshine and
the rain, we can reach out for the sky, no more pain and no more sorrow, for
you i am the one that i could never be..........
i know, happy harcore cheesy stuff........but its just so  happy and lovey i
don't understand how you could not like it.......you really have to hear the
beat to feel the words, but just take my word on it.........:)

a friend of mine grew up in orlando, right near both nasa and disney. 
anyway, he always had season passes to disneyworld, so he spent a lot
of time there, exploring the seedy underbelly of the disney empire.

one time he was on the "it's a small world" ride, when the floats
broke, and everybody was stuck in the middle of the ride.  now i don't
know if y'all have ever been on "it's a small world", but basically
you have all these mechanized puppets singing the same two lines over
and over, in different languages, depending on where your little boat
is sailing past.  anyway they were stuck there for a really long time,
so they wound up having to listen to those two lines being sung over
and over again for about an hour and a half, in eskimo, by inane
little puppets endlessly repeating the same goofy mechanical actions
that weren't really all that cool the first time you saw them. 
eventually one woman started screaming uncontrolably till her face
turned purple.  another guy decided he just couldn't take it any more,
and got badly shocked trying to wade out of the ride...

well that's what he told me, anyway.  and thus another urban legend is
born...

Gotta pay the rent, so I'm selling my 1200s. They are in great condition,
never
used outdoors, and I am the original owner. Equipped with a matched pair of
Stanton 680 ELs. Price is $500, firm, no haggling (like I said, I have to
pay the
rent, like real soon). Cash, cert. check, or M.O. I live in SF (twin peaks)
and if
you want to, you're welcome to come by and try them out. Our number is
415-641-4214. It's busy a lot, so send email if you can't get through.

Gonna have to buy new decks when I can afford them again, but at least I
won't get rained on :).

for some reason i feel like i saw it at the trancefactory. can't remember
if I saw a tape behind the counter, or if I saw an ad for the tape in XLR8R
i was reading while standing at the counter.    or maybe i saw ron d core
totally destroying the the trancefactory counter with an XLR8R magazine.  I
think i was 420'd at the time.

might be worth it to call.

> i would be interested to know of anybody listens to ron

No one listens to ron d. core!   he's scary and plays scary music!  eeek!
I'd rather listen to Skinny Puppy on crack!  aiiieeeee!

just kidding!  :o)   I'll betcha Drakonis Dragonheart listens to him!

Granted I would have gone banana's if I'd got stuck on the ride too, but I
don't agree with your comment on the not so great looking puppets.(Not a
flame just a tangent) If your between the ages of 4-10 those puppets are
awesome. My memories of Theme parks when I was a little kid are magical and
the rides were amazing. When ever I've gone back "as an adult" I notice the
cheap trinkets and dolls that once looked so real are really beat up and
fake looking. At first I felt ripped off and upset but then I decided to
ignore it and have fun and the same energy and excitement that was there
when I was a kid was there again.
I guess my point is that with a little imagination and enthusiasm you can
have a blast anywhere anytime. ;D

(Sunny using Molly's Mail)

Well I just came from the Police meeting with the 11th & Folsom
merchants association where Capt. Martel told the group that they've
filed papers to revoke the liquor licenses of 3 SOMA clubs immediately. 
VSF, Big Heart City, and he would not mention the name of the third
club.  I knew this was bigger than just one club.

Hi Rave Friends,

        The following is a letter written in response to the "Dear Abby"
column in the March 31 San Francisco Chronicle.  I thought I would post it
in light of the renewed SFR discussion of drug use...


Dear Abby,
Universal Press Syndicate,
P.O. Box 69440,
Los Angeles, CA  90069

Dear Abby:

        This is in response to the letter you printed from "Older, Wiser
And Clean," the 18-year-old college student whose negative experiences led
her to believe that no one should "experiment" with "drugs" (presumably
meaning those drugs banned by our government).

        Her story has something in common with numerous other similar
stories I've heard and witnessed -- a lack of moderation.  First there is
the binge -- a reckless use of substances, coupled with strong denial that
there is a problem, leading one's life into a downward spiral.  Then there
is the purge -- total sobriety, coupled with an extremely intolerant
attitude toward the illicit drug use of others.  Some people go through one
binge/purge cycle, while others repeat the pattern over and over.

        I am 27 years old.  I first smoked marijuana when I was 20, and
since then have tried MDMA, LSD, crystal meth, magic mushrooms, 2CB, and
GHB.    There are others I have stayed away from, including heroin,
cocaine, and PCP, because they don't seem to offer much value, but I can
say unequivocally that drugs have been a positive influence in my life.
They have not kept me from holding professional jobs, serving in the
military, being happily married, or maintaining a high level of physical
fitness.  The only regret I have about these substances is that I was so
brainwashed in my youth that an irrational fear of addiction and
"destroying my life" kept me from broadening my horizons sooner.  The
desire to be "cool" was never a factor.  I tried illicit drugs because I
saw happy, well-adjusted people whom I admired and respected using these
substances, and my curiosity overcame my fear.

        If you find you can't take a particular substance responsibly, the
smart thing to do is stop taking it, but the too-much-or-nothing mind set
with regard to "illegal" substances is just plain stupid.  ("Illegal" is in
quotes because the prohibition of marijuana and other drugs is clearly
unconstitutional.  The U.S. Constitution was temporarily amended to allow
the prohibition of alcohol in 1919, but there has never been a provision
allowing the government to prohibit any other drugs.)  I have learned
first-hand that the infrequent hit of Ecstasy or 'shrooms, like the
occasional glass of wine, can be good for your total mind-body health.
It's easy to tell the difference between life and death, but it's harder to
measure quality of life.  If you never strap on a pair of skis, you'll
never die by skiing into a tree, but you'll also never experience the
beauty, the joy, the exhilaration, of flying down a snowy mountainside with
strips of fiberglass under your feet.

        Both skiing and drugs have provided me not only some incredibly
pleasurable moments, but a heightened sense of spirituality, of
understanding and appreciating what life is about.  I don't expect that you
will ever print a letter like mine which portrays drug use in a balanced,
reasonable light.  But if by some pang of conscience you do, I hope
everyone reading this will think long and hard about whether they want to
limit their experiences in life based on the irresponsible behavior
patterns or moral prejudices of others.

Signed,

Experimenting & Satisfied in San Francisco

Isn't life a BITCH!!!     This is such crap.   I know many of the owners
and managers of the clubs in that area, and They have bent over backwards
to work out the situation in the neighborhood, but it's only getting worse
for them.    This is a typical case of selective enforcement that makes our
country the money oriented cesspool that it is.   Rich developers utilizing
the voices of disgruntled tenants so they can force the clubs out of
business and pick up the club property for new development.   It's such
bullshit that it makes me sick to my stomach.    Who do these people think
they are?   They are like a virus... a disease that needs eradication
before it grows and consumes itself, and everything around it.
They idiots chose to live next to the clubs, and If they don't like it then
move the hell out, and let someone that wants to life in that environment
move in.   It's amazing how self centered and egotistical these residents
are... that they don't even realize how irrational their demand are to have
an existing neighborhood remodeled to their liking, just because they now
live there.   If you have allergies, then you don't live in the outdoors...
and if you don't like noise, then don't live next to a nightclub.    It's
reality check time.

Keep it real...   Vlad

Precedence: bulk

DJ Saint - this cat has one of the dopest mix tapes (soul session) I have
heard in a while, I can't get it out of my player in the rig.  And believe
me, due to Ground Score, I listen to tons of mix tapes.  Being hyped off one
in particular is a great indication of someone's skills and tune selection.

He (DJ Saint) will be in San Diego May 1 - 5 th, maybe longer, and he may
venture our way (Bay Area) if he can lock down any gigs.  ?get the hint?

I recommend if you are having a party and want propper out of town drum n'
bass talent (without paying for flight etc.) just give me a shout and I'll
get you his addy, bio and tape.

What's up all you out there.  Thanks for checking yet another post of mine. (=

This round:  DJ's Noel and Abstract (two of the mighty Phunckateck Crew) are
heading out to the East Coast for a tour in June.   Don't sleep on this
opportunity to have two of the originators of the drum n' bass gig your
club, bar, store, etc.  

Not only do they destroy the decks but they produce their own music as well.
You know, taking it to that other level.  New trax are out on Green Label,
I'm sure you've all checked the XLR8R Big Shots CD, they have a new mix tape
is out as well called Cold Fusion.  Cheggit out.

For a personal viewing of the Phunckateck Crew's mad-action beta lounge sesh
- dial up www.betalounge.com and pull up last weeks antics.  While you are
there surf this web site, it is amazing.

for all of those out there that are fans of slowdive, my bloody valentine,
seefeel, loveliescrushing, etc...  (shoegazey-airy-ambient-experimental
sort of stuff)

i would _highly_ recommend checking out this show!

i caught -sweet trip- last time that they played at the justice league...
and i was pleasantly surprised!  it's so rare to find an actual band that
performs this type of music live, much less one with talent! 
i haven't heard any of the other artists that will be performing... but i'm
sure they're worth at least checking out!

*i am not affiliated with any of these artists...  just think that sweet
trip was amazing and want to spread the word and support their scene!

Well, it's one of those extremely rare moments where I want to go to a
massive.  Thing is, I have no idea of what massives are worth checking
out.  I want to know what's up for next weekend.  Not the weekend of this
week but the weekend after it.  If anyone could give me some ideas of
good huge ass parties to check out it would be most appreciated.

Thanx in advance.

i was just wondering if any of you know where i can get more info on 
what's beeh happening to sf clubs recently.  i'm currently in north 
carolina but once finals are over with (just 3 more weeks!) i'll be 
heading back home to sf and it's really dissapointing & agravating to me 
to hear about all this bullshit.  i leave my beautiful city for 8 months 
out of the year & i expect it to be taken care of while i'm gone, but 
obviously there are too many poeple around that just don't care what they 
do to san francisco (i'm not talking about my fellow ravers - i'm talking 
about the money hungry politicians/executives/assholes - pardon my 
language.) please let me know if there are any websites i can visit & if 
any one is interested in trying to stop this LET ME KNOW!!!  i'll be home 
may 10th.  you can e-mail me at duke until then, but please feel free to 
call or page (415.388.7313 or 1.800.5.SPRINT, pin # 315.0414)  i'm not 
about to just stand around and wacth this happen.

lovehugs&kisses,

i like dancing at clubs.  what can i do to help?  bomb the live/work
highrises?  maybe put a dog turd in a paper bag, douse it in kerosene,
light it on an obnoxious resident's front doorstep, then ring the
doorbell and run away?

that's about the best i could come up with, but perhaps you have some
suggestions about ways we could help - i have no idea how this city
hall stuff works.  maybe there's someone i could bribe?

seriously,
messiah

I am not speaking for myself, but moreso from history.  I would like to see
a change, but until I do, I will rest on what I said.  I wish someone would
make me wrong.  I believe that clubs will close and ravers will gripe, but
do nothing.

I think liquor licenses will be revoked, and ravers will do nothing.  All
of the talk of unity is all cool, it is another thing to make it reality.
Faith and support is another good place to start.  But you must organize,
plan, and execute.  All the praying in the world will not stop and
organized group of well financed people.  You will also need some finances.
Revolutions are never free.

Make me a very wrong man, please.  Good luck!

The way I look at it, it seems it doesn't matter what type of club or how
they treat people.  It's not a matter of the right kind of club, just that
one is being shut down (potentially), no matter how crappy they treat
people?  I don't know if that is a good enough reason or not.  Anyway to
me, they would garner plenty of support from people if they indded treated
people well.  That aside I think you have to deal with a reality that this
scene is going up against big, and I mean big money.

You also have to come to a reality that one persons livelyhood is another
nuisance in this case.  Both sides have very valid points!

Approaching this as big money against a poorly organized and temporal group
of partyers the odds are squarely against ravers.  What needs to happen if
ANYONE is really serious about this is:
-Club owners, partyers, and promoters need to present a unified front.
-Promoters & club owners, whose livelihood is at stake, should be the ones
financing this, with some money pitched in from the public (partygoers).
-promoters & club Owners should solicit signatures from people who vote in
the City and County of SF allowing them to have thier place , un harassed.
-Promoters, club owners, and partyers from all over should start a letter
campaign (e-mail ain't it, real letters, with real signatures) to:
	-Da Mayor
	-dept of permits
	-police dept.
	-fire marshall
	-sf chron
	-sf examiner
	-guardian
	-sf weekly
	-sj merc
	-la times ???
	-board of supes
	-all of the local gay papers & orgs.
-Club owners should sponsor free events in the park promoting music and the
dance culture.
-People should attend any public meetings that may result from the ruckus.
What should happen is that more and more people should show up each time.
If you can go to sefveral parties a month, there should be no problem in a
continued and increasing presence at meeting relevant to your cause.
-Protest in the streets @ or on SOMA near the clubs.  Peaceful, with music!

Look if you and others care so much, this is the ONLY way to fight this
thing.  So either get ready for a long protracted battle, or lose the
nightlife everyone feels is threatened.

The hardest thing will be in getting the various factions of  flighty
clubbers, club oweners, and the ever so flighty promoters together, put
aside all of the ego rubbish, and get this thing done.  Anything less is
doomed to failure.

As a famous pracher once said, "If you see a good fight, jump in it!".

Peace & good luck to those with the guts,
John

P.S.  More strategy:  You're looking into the future and after some massive
meetings and some grass roots organizing you're ready to execute.  Do you
have a plan that the city can live with?  Let's say you're going to lose
the SF turf war, what next?  Treasure Isalnd, that's what!  Willie wants to
make that place a big night club so why not propose that as an alternative?
How about the city aloow, and even finance clubs in SOMA moving there, and
allowing some percentage of them, permits for after hours?  Willie said he
wants that, all you have to do is make a counter proposal, a solution to
the overall problem of "Where is the nightlife of SF!".

Just some thoughts from one who has done battle before.

I see the points in the posts below from John Lee and Jen.  This is just
the order of things and not necessarily a bad one.  Hear me out before
you get all twisted.  The "haves" always move and spread to the areas
imposing on the "have nots" or the "have not as much."  If you're down
for the love of the party then you know that clubs close down and open
up again.  It's their business, like any thing else, there is a certain
amount of risk serving as folly to the current sign of the times.  S.F.
seems to be in that conservative let's beat on the downtrodden sort of
mode and mess things up.  

Hey, I empathize with the club owners since I'm a patron just like the
next person.  John is right in saying that history is against us (and I
do mean us as in all party people, and please don't glorify it as some
kind of movement because all I can say is that I'll wait to see what
you're doing ten years from now).  Our scene is the underground and then
it gets discovered in all its layers so then is mainstream all over the
place.  

Look at it as a cycle, sometimes you got to go outlaw and back
underground to build the love up again to explode unknowingly in
people's lives to show them the light.  The clubs and business owners
related to our scene are suffering to no end and it sucks, no doubt.  I
take it that their sacrifice will dictate the party be taken somewhere
else, na'mean.  It's a party folks, it lives on and if you don't
know...well, you know the saying.  

Movements come and go, but the party lives on.  If you're looking to be
a white knight, understand the uphill battle you will fight and weigh
the pros and cons.  If the club stays open, it's not like you can just
totally relax as if the SFPD is not going to hold a grudge.

IMHO, better to work toward making a better party location where you
might not get hassled.  Fighting for your rights has its pitfalls
alright.  I've just been one of the type who looks forward.  You've got
to lull them to sleep into thinking they have you.  It's no different to
the slave days (sorry John, just trying to get you worked up, you my
homey doh), when dance was practiced as a form of fighting.  You've got
to get'em thinking one thing when all the time you're still right there
getting your groove on.  I mean if it's the party you love, don't worry.
Selfish?  Maybe, but for a club owner/promoter to think that it's a
hassle free world and that something is forever or will last as close to
it is naive.  Either that or they ain't greasin' the right palms, fact
of life.  It's the same wherever you go.  Money talks, bullshit walks.
Power of the people and all that is great for real human issues.  As far
as this topic, you've got to see that even if you win, you lose.  Livin'
in a fishbowl ain't pretty.

I haven't forgotten the more evolved party people who just like the
dependability of clubs because they've paid their "dues" with
underground sets.  What can I tell ya, shit changes, deal.  By that, I
mean assess, plan, react.  Let's do this like a nudist
buddhist...where's the next party?

outta change,

comment number one. this happens all the time. unfortunately i'm
guilty of it myself in living where i live. not that i'm keeping ppl's
livelihood away, but that i'm contributing to the gentrification of
the tenderloin.

snip

one point i'd like to make here is that this might be a case in which
one would support somethning that they disagree with in order to
support the rights of ppl they do agree with. to me, i don't give a
shit whether vsf lives or dies. i don't much care for clubs and all
the spandex they hail period. i just like the fact that they have
running water when raves do not. other than that, i def. prefer a
party. :)

> You also have to come to a reality that one persons livelyhood is

agreed - i can see both sides. i do see more tho that these yuppies
moved into an area that is known for its nightlife. what did they
expect? guess i just don't care for the yuppies coz they're making
what *used* to be affordable housing for artists into an expensive
trend.

LOL!!!!!!! (oh my god someone help me i'm laughing so hard my stomach
hurts) a lot of ppl talk, and a lot of ppl talk shit. period. welcome
to raver land. :)

i don't think anyone will lose anything. so what - vsf might get shut
down. if sf is like any other city another club will open soon to take
its place. perhaps with the same  owners, perhaps in the same venue.
it's amazing how these things work out. anyway aren't there zoning
laws to protect these guys? (sorry if this has been pointed out - i
read only a few of the posts on the subject)


> As a famous pracher once said, "If you see a good fight, jump in it!".

or talk a lot about jumping, anyway.

> Peace & good luck to those with the guts,

guts? or is it those with patience, fortitude, tenacity.... or just
those who have nothing that's a higher priority than protecting their
party?

sorry - i'm in a foul mood. and this irks me more that these ppl are
eating up what *should* be and *was* affordable housing. but having a
club is so much more important....

nighty night!

Sorry for those that didn't get them, I know how bad it is to want decks!
But DO get some, cause it is just about the funnest thing to do (next to
motorcycles), and there are never enough new DJs with new ideas.

Gang,

Been busy. REAL BUSY! (Oh yeah, get busy, get busy...)

Oh wait. THAT'S HIP HOP SLANG.... Flame me...jus' go ahead...

Anyway, I promised awhile ago about sending mixes out to all you gang,
posse,members of SFRAVES who sent me email requesting a copy.

Here is a recap of all that I promised a CD to:

1) DEREK  F
2) .mat.
3) Megan Hug!
4) Minh

There are some others that I could get copy but didn't give me info. as to
where I should mail it to. They ARE! :

1) DJ Nick
2) Eric Kato
3) Tabitha

The above three should send me their mailing address so I can get it out to
you.

People that I would like to send it to:

1) Brian B. (a little somethin' for the list miester)
2) JSL (for invigorating email conversation)
3) Layne (for working the same hours as me while we read SFRaves email)

Invitation is open for y'all.

Now, for the good news: I really listened to the last one I did and decided
it was pretty crappy. I decided that I should redo another one that was
just plain better.

Hence the long time since I promised to send it out. Here is the play list
of the new one that I will MOST DEFINITELY SEND OUT! (Sorry 'bout the
flake..)

1-	Isaac Hayes
	IKE's PLEA

2- 	Havana
	SCHTOOM (Slam Remix)

3- 	The Martian
	LOST TRANSMISSION FROM EARTH

4-	Delerium
	EUPHORIA (Rabbit in the moon mix)

5-	Astral Matrix
	WOBBLE

6-	Thomas Barnett
	RE-SYNTHESIZE

7-	Floor Essence
	PIGS & PENGUINS

8-	Underworld
	OICH OICH

9-	The Martian
	STARDANCER

10-	Rest Assured
	TREAT INFAMY (Alternative 12" Club Mix) - Gotta love that Verve sample

11-	DJ Icey
	THIS IS HOW MY DRUMMER DRUMS

12-	Uberzone
	MOONDUSTED

13-	X-Cabs
	ENGAGE

14-	Underworld
	SURFBOY

I will post it via realaudio for all you freaks who want to waste more time
in front of the 'puter (ahem, yes, I know. I'm the pot calling the kettle
black).

This one is much better than the former one that I thought was going to get
out to y'all. It's a journey, its a trip, its meaningful and wonderful.
It'll make you smile in an E-X-Tatic way....(hmmmm, flagrant. How sad. ;)

If you want a copy and you are not on the list above, send me your mailing
address and I will get a copy out to you by Monday.

PSA is finisio!

Merci.

Well i think we should have a party
in the middle of the street. No music or noise of any kind
a night of meditative silence. We have a mime dj spin
imaginary decks of silence ...listen to the internal music
form the cosmos amd we dance a silent dance till sunrise,
in the middle of the street.

after the residents have watched this strange bizzare
behavior for a few nights we end our little party as the 
sun rises and they crawl out of their unenjoyed
beds on the way to starbucks...we hand them flyers
that say we do this because there's something in the local
water that causes this strange behavior...they will be moving
imediately...i betcha...=)

And now for the long awaited exciting conclusion......

Day 8:
I guess it was the lack of sleep all week that did it. I dunno but I was
feelin adventurous. The road trip plans for driving to So-Cal for E-3
fell through when word was that E-3 was postponed. I had promised a
friend down there that I'd spend the weekend with her, and when I make a
promise I keep it. Well I didn't wan to go down there and party with
people I didn'tknow so I left work at 12 noon and drove to Northrodge
picked her up and drove straight to Berkeley and was just in time for the
T&J Favtory party. This party was dope. The music was mind blowing, the
people were so friendly and I had an awesome time. The girl I brought
(Denise) had a blast and totally wants to come back and party up here
again. Only bad part of the night was some dudes stole a bunch of stuff
from the store including a turntable a few tshirts a few hundred dollars
in quarters from a coin jar and various other items.

Day 9:
Left the T&J Party with the intention of driving Denise back to So-Cal
but some very cool people(Lacie, TOny) rufused to let that happen (in
case I'd fall asleep on the way back and die in a car accident )and
pitched in to buy her a plane ticket back home. I luv you guyz. =) Well
me and some folks(BBong, Lacie) wandered around the bay wasting time and
after picking up tix in Solid Grooves for Bionic (I had a wierd feeling
that we should be buying tix for the Rbel ALiance party but a bunch of
our frenz were already going to be at Bionic) and then we headed up to
people park to catch the tale end of Ethan's set (beautiful) Minh allowed
us(Michael, Tony, Lacie, and ME ;D) to Crash at his place. So after two
hours of sleep we woke up and went to Bionic. Bionic was overcrowded,
hot, and too smokeee. I tolerate people smoking but I really had a hard
time breathing. I went out side and met some cool people. Went back
inside to find D(Natasha426) and the SLOTribe(Geoff Adam and Ray) needin
air too. The music sucked so we went outside and it was real cold so we
went back to the car and Listened to the Man- Geoff Herbst's new mix tape
(Auditory oragsma WoW!) Really deep spiritually uplifting epic trance
stuff. It's a must listen for anybody who likes that kinda stuff. After
about 4 hours of deep meaningful conversations the rest of the raving
party returned and we headed back to D's place to crash and hang for a
lil while.

Day 10:
Go home and crash for a few hours bringing weekend sleep totals to about
4.5 hrs. Listened to Micron's new tape (I still have to write a review
for that but it's coming soon)  and Watched Lost in Space. The rest of
the day was spent hangin with my frend Joel and with Family. Very dull
day which after that spring break week I really needed.


Note:
The only night this entire week that I partook of mind altering
substances was Tuesday night when I drank a few Beer's during the Bar
Hopping. And most of the time I outlasted my Cracked out frenz on the
dance floor. Just a reminder that it is possible and definitely still fun
to party sober. It'll be a while before I'll be at a party again (end of
May) because of skewl  so I'll be expectin review's galore of all the
Great parties I'll be missin.

luv'n'hugz' to thoze who know they deserve it

The long term end result of you being in the tenderloin?  Pricing others
out of the market, including merchants.

They expected to change the neigborhood.  It looks like they are

Nope.  Zoning in these areas are in a constant state of flux.  Especially
when a building is converted for use from commerce into living space.

guts = fortitude, tencity, perseverance.  I make no value judgement about
which is more worthy.

You know the sorry thing is that I don't know what to do and it's tough
to make suggestions when you haven't a clue yourself.  At yesterday's
SOMA meeting the South Station Captain Martel said that we needed a
powerful & respected voice to speak on behalf of the SOMA clubs because
the developers had such a person working on their behalf.  But the fact
remains if you are a Real Estate developer who can turn a 5 story
warehouse into 35 Loft units that will sell for $350-$450K/loft, you're
probably already pretty connected in the city governement.
Unfortunately, the club owners aren't held in as high regard.

Oh yeah, in response to all of the complaints and the "general feeling
on the part of the public that the clubs are operating unchecked,"
Captain Martel also announced yesterday the formation of a new 5 officer
night
patrol, (actually 4 officers & 1 sargeant) dedicated solely to policing
the South of Market club scene.  Joy.

The only thing you can fight money with if you don't have any yourself is

Hello sfraves,

On Monday 4/20 (April 20th) I will be spinning at the Afterglow weekly down
in S.J. I believe that SHO is playing as well. (along with the residents
Li, Andy, Science)

So it will be great to play in San Jose again (I have not in the South Bay
for over 1 year) and even better to see all of the friendly, familiar faces
again. So come out and show your support to this weekly. Hope to see ya there!

Peace and love,

HOW TO CLEAN YOUR MOUSE             
                          
This memo is from an unnamed computer company.  It went to 
all field engineers about a computer peripheral problem.  The author 
of this memo was quite serious.  The engineers rolled on the floor.

Mouse balls are now available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit).
Therefore, if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform 
erratically, it may need a ball replacement.  Because of the delicate 
nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be 
attempted by properly trained personnel.

Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining
the underside of the mouse.  Domestic balls will be larger and harder 
than foreign balls.  Ball removal procedures differ depending upon 
the manufacturer of the mouse.  Foreign balls can be replaced using 
the pop-off method.  Domestic balls are replaced by using the twist-off 
method. Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive
handling can result in sudden discharge.

Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used
immediately. It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of
spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction.  Any
customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of 
removing these necessary items."

Howzabout Michael Stipe....he's been spotted incessantly lurking around
town, recording and stuff.  Maybe he's had such a fantastic time here, he'd
want to give back a little.

That is a great idea.  Michael Stipe and Madonna heading the united
front for freedom to dance.  Who's got the PR connections to make the
contacts.  How would you get the word out to the media?

Thomas figgered it's been awhile since any hardcore has happened in
Candyland by the Bay.  He couldn't book me because of the obvious lineup
conflicts, but then this morning, i got this goofy lightbulb that it would
be really funny if i opened up the night in the hardcore room, busting out
the Brian Eno & Enya records, then Ron D Core came on after me..
BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM!!BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM!!


-BOOM!erang

PS  I read in an article once that Ron D. plays better when he's pissed
off, so I'mma get there early & give him a wet willy.

media is the easiest part.  if stipe & Madonna will be there, so will the
media--ya just have to call them.  the hard part is writing well- worded,
convincing letters to the publicity agents.

Actually, as weird as this may be, Madonna, may be able to help out.   9
months ago her organization bought the old Stone Night Club on Broadway, and
it is in the process of being renovated.   It's going to be one hell of a hot
spot in town once it's completed.

How knows, she may either be sympathetic and try to help out her fellow club
owners, to eliminate any possibility that the same thing may effect her, or
just see it as less competition, and not give a crap.   Or she may be behind
the whole conspiracy of it all.    ?????   Who knows now days.

Keep it real...   Vlad

i think that bringing the media in is a GREAT idea.  I think we should
drop MTV a line.  Also, does anyone have contact info. for the kids at
the Right to Dance movement, i need to talk to them.

I just got the e-mail of some hound from MTV, my buddy in Chicago who
works in the ad world gave it to me.  It was suggested to me that one of
those homegrown stories about an issue you're interested in might be
appropriate.  Just exploring options.  Waiting for the guy to get back
to me.  Desperate measures for desperate times.  

Aloha,
Moki

I already have an e-mail to the club scene news guy at MTV, just waiting
to hear back.  Does anyone else have contacts with sympathetic
organizations?

WOW!

O.k., I got a lot of responses and I will be sending out the Mix to y'all
who have sent me email w/ your address.

Right now it is getting cost and time prohibitive for me to send out any
more for free, so I have to cap off the offer for a free mix mailed to you
personally (I'm heading into the 30 area right now....) If I had the moola
& time, trust me, I'd send it out like freeware (like APACHE BABY! WHOOO
HA!), but I don't, so I apologize.

Anyway, Thanks for the overwhelming interest. I hope you all enjoy it. It
will be mailed by the end of this week.

JSL, Layne, and Brian, I still have a copy for you if you'd like.

Other than that, PEACE LIKE CHICKEN GREASE!

Merci.

rob.

Especially since the dance community has rejected her because
shes "too commercial" or just "trying to capitalize on the 
latest trend"

I think she has a history with the dance community and has paid her
dues.  I'm sure she's seen this kind of thing before.  But if she
doesn't want to get involved then no biggy.  She has tons of clout and
would know what she's talking about.  Who else has the deep connection
to the dance community, Paula Abdul?  I rest my case.

Aloha,
Moki

CHICAGO
            Tuesday, April 14,1998 - 05:13 PM ET


            (AP) Bad reactions to prescription and over-the-counter
            medicines kill more than 100,000 Americans and seriously
            injure an additional 2.1 million every year, far more than
most
            people realize, researchers say.

            Such reactions, which do not include prescribing errors or
            drug abuse, rank at least sixth among U.S. causes of death
            behind heart disease, cancer, lung disease, strokes and
            accidents, says a report based on an analysis of existing
            studies.

            "We're not saying, 'Don't take drugs.' They have
            wonderful benefits," said Dr. Bruce H. Pomeranz, principal
            investigator and a neuroscience professor at the University
of
            Toronto.

And how many die from medical marijuana?
Can someone pass this onto the cannabis club or dennis peron?

Hello! I'm a mewbie here(sfraves) but i recognize some of your names 
from other places. I've been lurking and checking things out...you all 
seem pretty neat. I was at the F8 party and I agree with all who 
went...it rocked! I myself said I would never go to another 2nd and 
Jackson party ever again ever since XNTRK (anyone go to that one? 
eeeek!), but I gave it another try anyway. Some of you may have seen me 
@F8 I was the gurl with the flourescent yellow fuzzy star backpack. DRC 
rules! I must say that Mars pulled off an incredible set as well. Well, 
that's my two cents. Bubye.

Happy Easter Everybody!!!
hmmmm...Well, the Gathering was Great :) I didn't get there till 12:00, 
so I missed Jeno, Josh, and Tony's set, and then when I got there it 
seemed kinda slow, but when this white guy with a cigarette started 
spinning it went off!!..And then after him(or maybe it was him), Slam 
spun, who was also incredible.  The people there were totally cool, and 
the price was a bit to high---I've always paid 20 for Choice pr., and it 
was 25!!--**crying**--Ow, well..too late now. 
Hope everybody had a goodtime last night!!!
**hugz**
Peaceout

...

Once this announcement exists, it should be easy to get it read and
discussed by djs on KZSU, KPFA, (KSJS?), Radio Free Berkeley, etc. -
especially since many of these djs subscribe to this mailing list!  It
might not help that much in reaching the general public, but it would
get the word out to the interested people in the scene - the more
people who hear about this static, the better.

Plus if several bay area stations are running public service
announcement about organizing public opposition to license
revocations, we would have a start towards making this a 'news item'
that other local media would report on.  I'm sure that local media is
a small community, and word of mouth would count for a lot.

Hey, if we get 2 cents from everybody, we might have a couple bucks!
Matt.

      this is too late - not like we weren't at Chevy's past then :) )

Peace,

I think this thread, and many of the comments I've read in regards to it, is
highly ironic.

Mainly though, it's ironic that when this music and culture is recieving more
attention in this country than ever before, that it is also seemingly being
threatened more than ever.

That fact is a signal to me that it may be time to return all of this to its
essence, where it originated in the first place. We may not have a choice; the
decision may be made for us.

To all involved in the conversation,

Has anyone thought to present the DJ as an artist and the venue/stage is
the club by which they perform? In this light, maybe some of the artist
groups in the city who champion SF as a cultural city might jump in on the
bandwagon to protect important music venues such as clubs for electronic
music artists.
The problem with getting the club owners involved is that the city
percieves the issue as being a pure money issue. Dollars vs. dollars... the
one with the most almost always wins and is seen as the beneficiary of good
things.
If you position the argument as one that lists these problems as
potentially reducing the cultural significance of SF, then maybe you can
phrase your greivance in a way that speaks to the inherent pride SF'ers
have w/ their city.
No Venues. No musical artistry for the next age. Certainly SF can take
itself off the map of significance for this type of important development.
(hmmmm, this might play well with the New Media/SOMA groups as well.)

Its a stretch, but the idea here should be to reposition the argument that
allows us to define the solution in a way that takes money directly out of
the equation and makes the city planners, law enforcement, look at it as a
cultural issue.

Anyway, just writing out loud.

All this talk of celebrities...anyway be sure you all are tight and
organized before bringing up these names.  It's fine for brainstorming, but
organization is the key, and IMO that is where you all might want to start.

Just to clarify - I don't kick people off arbitrary, when mail starts
bouncing back with a somewhat authoritative tone I remove them (e.g. "User
Unknown")... when it bounces back with something more temporary I wait for
a few days ("Full Mailbox", etc).

Ecstasy seized at Channel Tunnel

LILLE, France (Reuters) - A record 357,900 ecstasy tablets were seized
at the
Channel Tunnel terminal in the French port of Calais, police said
Wednesday.

The haul was discovered at the end of last month aboard a Belgian
registered truck as
it was about to join a train heading for Britain. The Belgian driver,
who has not been
named, was arrested and is being held in custody.

Some 10 kg (22 lb) of cocaine was also found on the truck.

A police spokesman said the ecstasy find represented more than double
the total of
all ecstasy seizures in France last year. He added that the famous
tongue logo of the
British rock group the Rolling Stones had been printed on the tablets.


....thats 7,158,000$ worth of E



Wait, there's more....

They smuggled marijuana in hearse

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Six men were arrested in Colombia on charges of
transporting more than 1,320 pounds (600 kg) of marijuana in a hearse,
police said
on Wednesday.

The alleged smugglers, all clad in black, aroused suspicion because they
were
riding in the hearse and another vehicle in a mock funeral procession
down a
deserted stretch of highway at 2 a.m. Tuesday.

The hearse, a 1977 blue Ford, was stopped just outside Medellin, capital
of the
northwestern province of Antioquia, police spokesmen said.

Instead of a coffin or a corpse, they said, the hearse was found to
contain large
packets of marijuana.

The drugs were seized and the men were jailed.

People with a vested interest in the city and how it's run.  He who has the
money has the power.  It may suck but it is a reality you must deal with if
indeed you are going to go into battle.

Like humanity itself.  Ever growing, making species extinct, and ever moving.

Naive.  People always change their environs when they move in.  You build a
house, and change it to your liking.  You buy land and push every living
thing out to make a foundation.  We mimick nature to the extreme.  We all
do the same thing to a greater or lesser extent.  Understanding this will
allow you to attack a problem, or the problem, with more clarity.

The property owners think of ravers as "self centered and egotistical".
Witht he backing of thier money their gripes are heard loudest and first.

What you don;t realize is how irrational you look to them.  The fact is
they do live there and have every right to create a neighborhood of their
choosing.  This is called gentrification people, sf stylee.

Remove the plants to you liking is also another choice when you're a human.

Or remove the nightclub to your liking.

Who's?  And who's reality will ultimately win?  My moneyu is on the people

perseverance.  So far land owners 1, ravers 0.

"Vibe This!" Hahaha. That's rich. ;-)

Excellent references. Ha!

Here's one (albeit unsolicited and made up):

I have known Rick for over two years. In that time, he has raved with the
best of them. When raving, he dances as he should, only taking necessary
breaks. Rave after rave, Rick works hard at being animated, tolerant, and
phun. He has qualifications in all of the good drug categories and has
OD'ed only once on-site (that being in his first few rave months when most
all of us have had a time of it.)

Overall, I would say that he is certainly qualified for the position of
ride-needin' raver and would recommend him to anyone who is prone to party
and has four wheels.

Hope this helps! ;-)

Hello All,

I've been getting quite a few e-mails forwarded to me in regards to the
escalation of ongoing problems...I have a suggestion.

You'd be surprised how many people you can find through the internet.  Try
doing a search on "celebrity white pages" and there is a myriad of resources
for you to chose from.  I have had much luck getting into contact with
people this way...that is not to say that we should inundate them with
unwanted requests, but a few keenly worded e-mails might do the trick.  I
would say really refine a search, only to whom you think would be most
responsive to this issue.  

I already have some wheels turning myself on this one...good luck!

Hello my raver net friends! Mr. Ravin' Rick is flying into town this
weekend to attend the "Vibe This" rave put on by Vibration this Sat. nite.
As I will be flying in from Indiana, I will need a ride from the airport
to the rave. I will be flying into the San Fran or San Jose airport (not
sure yet which) and would really asppreciate a ride to the rave. I will
pay for gas, or your ticket in, or whatever. I do have friends who will
already be at the rave, just need a way there. I am totally cool and youi
will be making a new friend. I am a raverg, with a good job. Really
looking forward to this weekend, my big weekend getaway. I am a member of
raverg but not sfraves, so please reply to me directly. I have excellent 
references available upon request. 
Thank you very much,
Rick

Reminds me of that time in London...

So there I was, hanging out in Leicester Square, waiting on Nigel and
Beanbag to show up.  I was broke and hungry and cold, and to make matters
worse, my drawers were soaking wet from the rain.

Nigel had told me to meet him at the pub because he had some information
about a kid named Truffles who was in the tank in Holland.  Truffles was
busted for some passport problem, and he'd left 20,000 E's in a locker at
the ferry terminal in Rotterdam.

Nigel had the scoop on the locker number, and he was going to tell me how
to pop the door open and pinch the pills before Truffles got out of the
tank.

So it was pouring rain when Nigel and Beanbag show up, and we go inside the
pub for a warmer and to talk about the crime.

"Please don't go along with this stupid plan, Boomerang!"  Beanbag tried to
tell me.  "Truffles never did anything to hurt you.  Why should you go all
the way to Holland to pinch a bunch of E's from someone who's never done
anything to you?"

Beanbag wasn't too hip on the idea, she had all these wonderful things to
say about karma and respect and what she's learned on the rave circuit.
But me and Nigel, we're incoorigible hooligans, right nasty bastards when
you think about it.  Besides, we both know that raves aren't about nothing
but scoring money and maybe a bird to bring home to the sack.

So when Beanbag started putting up a fuss, Nigel told her to cram it and
sent her up to the bar for 3 pints.  While she was gone we got down to
business:   Truffles had left Amsterdam with 20,000 E's, and stuffed them
in a locker at the ferry port in Rotterdam, just to keep it cool while he
was waiting for the boat back home.  Well, he ran into some trouble with
the coppers, and when his passport didn't check out,  they stuck him in the
can for a couple of weeks. He'd called home for help, and pretty soon word
got around about the treasure in locker number 715.

Since I was broke, Nigel told me to beat it on down to the dockyards and
get to gabbing with one of the sailors, see if I could swing a ride across
the Channel to Rotterdam in the hold of a boat.

Nigel, nasty poof that he is, didn't have the decency to lend me 10 quid
for carfare down to the docks, so I had to nick a motorbike from Covent
Garden, which I properly rolled into the Thames when I was finished with
it.

Down at the docks, I got to chatting with a lad named Bill,  he was a
rugged old meathead, teeth all rotten from snorting too much nitrate.  The
old lunk worked on one of the boats, said he could stow me in the hold and
take me across the Channel to Rotterdam.  All he wanted in return, he said,
was was a little bit of company now and again.

Well, it wasn't until my first night in the hold that I figured out what he
meant by "company".  I'd got to thinking he wanted to guff it up about
football scores and such, but on no, my friends.  Bill showed up in the
hold that night, eyelids a-fluttering and ready for company.  I put up my
dukes and was ready to fight my way through hell and high water, but old
Bill threatened to yell for the captain if I didn't loosen up.

Let me tell you, friends, I went through five days of hell, being tossed
about by the waves during the day, and tossed about by old Bill at night.
The man was a frightful savage, committing the most uncivilised acts
imaginable on my poor body.  I'm not much of a softy, but by my third day,
I was in tears at the very thought of my next visit from Bill.  Sometimes
got to thinking I should have listened to Beanbag when she warned me about
karma and all that happy bollocks.

My only consolation was the promise of those 20,000 E's in locker #715.
20,000  could last me quite a long time,  and thinking about ripping off
that poor sucker Truffles made my suffering manageable.

On the fifth night in the hold of the rusty old vomit-bucket, the door
swung open and I braced myself from another onslaught from sailor Bill.
Instead, there in the door, was the Captain himself.

"Keeping company for that scalawag Bill, are ya, lad?"

"Please, sir,"  I begged.  "Don't send me back to London.  I need to get to
Holland by the end of the week.  I have important business there, and Bill
promised me a ride."

"Holland, eh?  Ahh, that old pirate!"  the captain cried.  "I supposed he
neglected to mention that this here vessel is a charter barge running up
and down the River Thames!"

To continue this thread, another angle would be how much money are these
clubs bringing into this city directly and indirectly.  From peninsula
residents driving up on the weekend  to foreigners flying in to enjoy
that famous San Francisco nightlife,  will they still come with their
money if that nightlife is damaged.  I would recommend those involved
with the clubs start coming up with some figures and a lawyer.

Interesting.  When you fly into SFO on Air France or Continental there
is a quick video that runs as you're landing that features highlights of
the city.  VSF was approached as was 1015 last summer to let the video
company tape a night. The result was approximately a minute of NIKITA
footage and a minute of PABLO'S SUGAR SHACK footage showing DJs Garth &
Taj.  This is all spliced together with shots of Fisherman's Warf, Cable
Cars etc.  We get a ton of foreigners who wander in asking if this is
the Sugar Shack that's on the air plane.  Strange to serve as a
"representative" of the same city that's trying to shut us down.

I really doubt Martin would allow the loss of that spot to end the magic
of Freedom. He'll definately find another stop if this rumor is true. Lets
just thing positively and it'll work itself out. (=

Back into the blue'... :) No clouds in sight.... as I gaze into the
baby blue that's touching my cubicle window....

Another argument that could be presented is that people
come from around the WORLD to check out the SF music
scene.  Few come from around the globe to look at the
bitchin live/work loft spaces in soma.

I hear Willie B hisself is backing the clubs, so mebbie
there is hope.

So all day Wednesday I'm giddy at work, real excited like because I'm
going to see Astral Matrix that night.  On my ride up to the big city
everything was fine and dandy.  No major delays on the 17 at all.  To
quote Jake, or maybe it was Elwood, I was on a mission from God.

And I didn't even have to parallel park!

Get inside VERY early.  Found my little special spot right by one of
the padded tables and waited to be wowed.  Didn't take long.  Andrew
was getting me smiling just doing a sound check.

Stood around trading Tellytubbie stories for a bit at the bar then the
heavens opened and Astral Matrix went on.  Or something like that.  In
my heaven, this boy is going to provide the Musak! Danced around and
goofy grinned for most of his set.  The music was incredible but god,
the people out dancing were just as amazing.  It went beyond people
being nice to each other, but to the point where people were actually
just bonding with eachother.  You really meant it when you smiled at
someone.  And best of all, you REALLLLLLY meant it when you let out
this scream of approval.


So yeah, I guess you could say it was an okay shin-dig.


BUT THEN......
Go to drop off Steve and park somewhere I shouldn't have even though
HUNDREDS of people have done it before me, and I get my car towed.  
And the only thing I can think is, "Hmmm, $150 dollars to get my car
out of the impound lot, and know what, it was worth it."

Happy Birthday Andrew!  THANK YOU!


tabitha

Indeed, Freedom will happen. The racetrack isn't always his first choice of
location, and while it's loss (if true) is unfortunate if only for
sentimental reasons, he's actively looking at much more beautiful and
scenic outdoor spots.

O.k., o.k., got a question in light of the mix that I have finished
recently. If I try to sell them (to recoup costs for CD materials and
stuff) how do I go about making it legal?

Does anyone have any experience w/ this sort of thing? I definitely am not
Moonshine, so it would be more about getting permission to do it on a
personal level in order to not transgress on the rights of the artists.

Any help/advice would be appreciated....

Thanks,

Would that I were partying this weekend, it would be to "Vibe This!" to hear
the best of both worlds with beautiful Trance and Techno in one room and
phat drum'n'Bass and Jungle in the other room. A lot of SFR's will be there
to dance mingle and show there support for the awesome crew that will be
spining there.

Unfortunately the Tyranny of Homework and studying have chained me up and
thrown me into the dungeons of the horrid Education monster. My sentence to
spend the rest of the semester studying and working hard to get good grades
and not to see the night sky until I've done my time. =(

...uh huh....

Z-Trip played that classic beat last night at Double Dutch (thx Mark).
Z-Trip (Bombshelter DJ, AZ.) is the illest on the dex.  I am always blown
away by his tune selection, he has got to be given props.

~~First of all, hello to all.  Your weekly SF update is here~~

I would like to apologize to all those who were not able to get into
Eklektic (jungle flava) last week.  The club only holds 300 people and fire
codes were the issue.  I know, I heard the line went down the block, and
some people were turned away.  It only took about a half hour before
everyone was filtered in.  Once again Dara was blown away by the energy at
the club, thank you for making his night so exciting.  I am blown away by
the constant support of the heads and the true intensity of the vibe.
Thanks to everyone that make it so special.

Tonight when you come down to Eklektic, try to crawl out of the house before
11:PM,  I promise room to dance (=    I also promise:  SWINGSETT.  Yes our
yin residents Stareyes and Sage along side Ubiquity and Sirkus recording
artist from NYC, Swingsett.  

The **all new** Eklektic line-up.   Hosting proper talented crews from
California.  We want to give recognition for all their hard work.  Props to
UFO! for the mad art, number three, in our flier art series.  If anyone is
interested in receiving a flier to check out his art please send a self
addressed stamped envelope to Ground Score, 647 Cole Street, SF,CA 94117
e-addy: eklektic@hotmail.com

April23 - JUNGLE LOVE CREW (Sifu, Honey B, Madame Butterfly)
April 30 - PHUNCKATECK BOYZ (Abstract, UFO!, Noel, Jason Mouse)
May 7 - HOME INVASION TOUR (R.A.W., Oscar da Grouch)
May 14 - STEP 2K (PUSH, Gamekat)
May 21 - B.A.S.S. KRU (Flux, Rinse, Stareyes) *Stareyes' last date in SF for
a few*
May 28 - UMOJA SOUNDSYSTEM (Jun, tomas, MC Cokni O' Dire) *don't miss it*

Expect crazy antics, dubplates, and note the unity between artists that is
found only when crews come together and play with/off/and around each other.  

Did you know that Future Breaks (jungle radio KUSF, Sat. 4-5PM) was the
first radio show in the nation to debut the Reinforced Crew?  Congrats to
them!  Big Up's to Rita Johnson for putting the 6 date Reinforced Tour
together.  

Friday Night Sessions, another KUSF radio show is now being underwritten by
Eklektic.  We are proud to be fortunate enough to have been asked to do this
and also to have the funds to do it.  The hosts of the show are Andrew
Jervis (Bugs) and tomas (Umoja Soundsystem), two people we highly respect.
Check it, 90.3 FM, Friday nights 8-11.  

Dieselboy will be at Audio Impact this Monday, which means the club will be
jumpin off of the hook.  It is an exclusive booking, please call the BASS
Kru/Eklektic hotline at 415.332.5800 X797for info.  Audio Impact is the ONLY
18+ drum n' bass weekly in the city.  (touchbase may also be 18+, it resides
at the 11 11 cafe, they do not serve alcohol)

So, did you know, KRAFTWERK is comming to SF.  June 7th, the Warfield.  Do
not sleep on this one, I won't.  Thanks to FTT for yet again bringing in the
propper talent that most of us can't afford to.  I love it!

All you in So. Cal.  Keep an eye out for tomas of Umoja Soundsystem (former
LA resident), he will be giggin in LA for  the week of May 10 - 15th.  I'll
forward exact dates and locations in my next post.

New kids in town, from NYC.  They call themselves S.F. Hardstepaz, and they
will be throwing a drum n' bass weekly at Club 181 on Wednesday's.  Let's
see what these heads have for us SF locals.  I dig the one tape I have
heard, by Sub-G, it starts out with this Slayer sounding rock riff and then
drops into heavy bass tones.  They also have rolling papers for their
fliers, I had always wanted to do that....

Aceyalone has arrived....well not yet but on 4.20 Aceyalone, Abstract (tribe
unique), L*Roneous, Peanut Butter Wolf, Fat Jack and Raw B (beatsauce) will
be kickin up the flava on the Hip Hop side at the DNA.  

++BIG Up's to:
++Michelle Lolli for all the assistance with URB.
++Mudfoot for keepin it real at all times and NEVER giving up.
++Jeffe for the Synergy opportunities
++3D for the mad props
++Andrea for writing her senior thesis on women in the underground

Hi all-

We've been a bit late getting the presale tix into the stores, sorry!

They should now be at the Trance and Jungle Factory in Berkeley, and Solid
Grooves in San Jose.

$10

much love and energy,

terry

Silliest is the one to go to.  It's only $10 and it will go OFF!!!   The
space and decorations are going to be out of control, and it's a great
line-up: a real mixture of sounds.

Looks like a lot of *us* are going to be at this party. We should
*Definately* meet...... once and for all! (= What do you guys think of 2am
at the water seller?

I love the twin pyramids glancing back at me from downtwon Oakland...
pointing to the heavens.....  their bases on a plane much higher than most
buildings in the distance....  and the big white fluffy clouds painted in
the background....   sky shaving....   and a giant cargo boat crosses
the Alameda-Oaktown channel.... stocked with ramen noodles up the ying
yang and generic coco crispies...  and perhaps a crew member like myself
gazing out the expanse into the clouds behind me...

It's Thursday beautiful people.... lets make this weekend extra special
for everyone we know.

Back to the salt mine.... into the *I*nternet matrix... (=?

Love,
*BYRONi....... .   .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .    !

Bay Area Kiddies: 
Tonight, there's a get-to-gether which you all are invited, this is 
tended more towards the South Bay- I mentioned this get. about a month 
ago and it got canceled, but it's happening for sure this time. 
If your big on the age thing, the party heads will be around 17-20, 
possibly a few younger and a few older. A friend of ours will be 
spinning, he's a SJ local DJ, " Mystic Mike", just a bunch partiers/bud 
smokers/and drinkers will be there.  If you do want to drink, I 
recommend bringing your own drinks, or bringing money to put in on 
drinks, someone will probablly do a few runs here and there-

Directions: 
Take Stevens Creek(coming from Bascom), and make a right on SanTomas, 
and make a left on El Camino , a right on  kiely, and a right on 
Warburton. It's at the very very end of Warburton. The addy is 2467-

If you get lost you can page me at 
9328831 or call the 
house where it's at
244-7122

PeaceOut

Ok, it's not my BBQ. It's a friend of mine, but you can bring/invite 
whoever you want. No, no BBQ...but the longer you stay(more into the 
morning, we always go get food or make food)- It won't get started until 
9 or 10(I'll probabblly get there around 10, sence it's a good friend of 
mine). It usually starts picking up around 11 or 11:30--People leave 
whenever, and it goes till about 5 or 6 .

See you there, 
Liz

hard to say big words like teetrohy...er   tettra hi canaB...

well, we all know raving is for "the kidz", 18 and under only please
;)  but for the few of us who refuse to grow up, get religious, have
kids and move to suburbia...

messiah wannabe's raverdrinks
-----------------------------

yes that's right, when you're a jet-setting, rave-hopin, bikelight
socialite 20-something like myself, an evening out isn't an evening
out without a sophisticated mixed drink or three.  sure "wanna
backrub?" gets the job done, but "can i mix you a drink?" sounds so
much better.  just pack the ingredients for one or two of these into
an "alcoholic's briefcase" and sneak it in to your party of choice. 
if you get caught just slip the security a ten-spot and tell em it's
ghb...



rocketfuel - two parts redbull to one part vodka 
----------   
c@weasel gave me the secret formula for this one, it's stunning in
it's simplicity and ease of covert mixing.  plus the buzz is...
unique...


the aging candyraver - gin, blowpop
--------------------   
like many of our finest technologies and styles of music, this was
invented entirely by accident.  fill a glass with as much gin as you
can stand to drink.  then add another ounce or two (important!). 
unwrap the blowpop and place it, bulb down, in the glass. let it sit
till the color of the blowpop has permeated the drink, then serve. 
you get a subtly sugared hard drink, available in a variety of colors
and flavors.  the blowpop acts as both stirrer and chaser...

the jetson - two parts white rum, three parts "obitz"
----------   (any flavor), two or more "space age"
             lookin glasses

the hardest part is finding a gas station that still sells orbitz -
you know, that weird looking drink with the little collored globs
floating in it.  well, i wouldn't drink it on it's own either, but
it's actually quite tasty once you mix in some hard liquor.  to do
this right you really must have a couple of groovy lookin coctail
glasses though - just check out the "housewarez" section of your fave
thriftstore.  think "star trek - the old generation" (if you can't
remember william shatner ordering one too many andruvian boilermakers
before hitting on the green bellydancer from alpha centuri, you're
probably too young to be reading this...)
             

and finally...  i gotta tell the story behind this one before i reveal
it's name...

me, pjfuzzy and our friend bradford were driving around manhattan one
night, just enjoying the ride, watching all the streetpartys and mob
scenes after the yankees won the world series.  anyway i had thrown a
party at my parents house the weekend before, and i had all these
not-quite-empty bottles of exotic liquors to get rid of.  so we were
trying to come up with drinkable combinations out of these various
bottles, and when we'd come up with a good one, we'd give it a
suitable name.  finally bradford handed up a really tasty one to me
and pj from the back of the car...

"i like this, what's in it?"
"oh, coca cola, cherry liquor, and everclear to taste..."
"this is sorta a girl drink, tastes like cherry coke.  i cant taste
the everclear at all!"
"well there's plenty in there.  give a couple of these to your high
school sweetheart and she'll have all the excuse she needs to give it
up..."
"brad, you're satan.  besides, my girlfriend graduated from high
school like two years ago..."
"he's right though.  plus, it's great for a car date - with the cap on
it's impossible to spill..."
"ok, this is a keeper.  what's it called?"
"'cherry buzz bomb'?  nah..."
"ummmm...  'high-school sweetheart'?"
"no, that's cheesey.  how about 'new coke'."
"already taken.  we invented it in a car, so it oughtta have a
car-related name.  'the drink and drive'?" 

finally brad pipes up from the behind us.  "well, i invented it, so
i'm gonna name it.  it's called... 'cherry in a back seat'..."


ok, so maybe you had to be there...

At a Special Olympics track meet, a young girl had just won the 50-yard 
dash
and was jumping up and down all excited.

She yelled out to her parents, "Look, Mom and Dad, I won."

Her parents burst into tears.

At the awards ceremony the young girl proudly stood there as the medal 
was
placed around her neck.

Then she ran over to her parents, who were crying now even more than 
before.

The three of them hugged ... as the parents kept on crying.

A Special Olympics official who had watched this whole scene became
concerned and went over to the parents and said, "Excuse me, is there
anything wrong?".

Through their tears, the mother said, No, nothing's wrong.  Everything's
right....We just heard our daughter speak for the first time."

Ok, if I haven't already apologized to you, I apologize again. To all 
those beautiful people that came down to the get-to-gether last night.  
Everything fell apart.  Besides the point that I heard the DJ was 
supposed to be pretty good(which he wasn't), and he showed up around    
2 1/2 hours late.  About 20-30 people that got there around 10 to 10:30 
left because it was pretty dead(which is understandable), and then as 
the night went on and picked up a bunch of random people that knowbody 
knew came by-  I would like to thank Vlad,  for telling Rob...Who in 
turn brought the guy from Germany, who definatly brought a better sound 
to the room-.  I'm sorry for those of you that broke plans just to come 
down,----
PeaceOut
**hugz**
Much love
Elizabeth

I've often thought a video toaster would be a great
thing to add to your tv- something that you could use
to alter the content of the programs while you are
watching them.  Nothing is more fun than taking tv
out of its intended context, altering the message and
content for your own devious ends.

ps sorry my post is a bit out of date been stuck
watching law and order the past week, that and my new
playstation have put me out of commision...

For a low cost low tech version try hanging a very thin piece
of cloth over your tv screen and turn down the room lights...it provides 
and interesting light show.

All you phunky phreeks! 

	I can't wait to join you this Sat. at Minh's party! Hmm... I might need
directions however... There sure is a toss up as far as the destination
party though. Hmm... Vibration or seeing the DubTribe? I love the
DubTribe!!! I love how both of them sing. Any one know how to get there
earlier stuff before it came out lately on the Imperial Dub label? Any
advice as far as the directions or the music will be much appreciated! Hope
to see you all very soon!

BTW I hope to see that way phat vibe I saw last week at the Gathering
upstairs during the last song! The feeling I got/gave is what keeps me going
strong so long is the scene. You guys agree? (if you were there last weekend)

-Your friend,
Josh

Hi Rave Friends,

        I'd like to point out that if we lived in a society that respected
property rights, people who moved into a neighborhood with noisy late-night
clubs and then tried to get them shut down would be laughed out of the
police department.

        But since we operate under a system where your neighbors get nearly
as much say about how you run your business and what you do on your own
property as you do, and it's all up to the arbitrary whim of a bunch of
government bureaucrats, inevitably those outside the mainstream (aka those
with less money and clout) are going to get shafted.

        I'm not so cynical to say that there's nothing we can do about it,
but I think we'll be more effective in creating positive change when we
recognize the true nature of the problem and address it.

Power to the people,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

Hi Steve,

        The reason I asked is that I don't think Willie Brown has done shit
for our scene, yet there seem to be continuing unsubstantiated rumors to
the contrary.  Not only do I see no evidence of him helping protect raves
or clubs, he appears to be working against the "little people" in general.


        Under Brown's regime, the SFPD appears to be spending *more* time
than before cracking down on victimless "crimes" such as living in your
vehicle (recent article on a Vehicular Residents' Association man's hunger
strike in the SF Bay Guardian), prostitution (check the front page of the
most recent SF Independent), marijuana use (a friend of mine was recently
arrested for "selling" pot to a homeless woman; in fact he had given her a
small amount for personal use, and considering that a search turned up only
$.62 between them, the idea that he was selling is ridiculous, not to
mention a complete waste of police resources even if a sale had been
involved), traffic violations (recent stories in the Chronicle about
Brown's crusade against double parkers, jaywalkers, etc.), and the homeless
(the number of arrests now is greater than it was under Frank Jordan's
hated Matrix program, according to homeless advocates).

        Since this was a private communication between us, I won't post
this to the list without your permission, but if you're cool with it,
please forward it to SFRaves for me.

Much love,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

the most cost effective home light show i've ever experienced is the
"psycholite" by radio shack.  they cost about $12 and fill an entire
room with this colorful, slowly shifting, wall-to-wall-to-ceiling
light show.  "highly" recommended...

Well, you could point that out but you would be sadly mistaken. Tenants of
a property have the right to "quiet enjoyment" of their property
regardless of who was there first. I found this great book at a thrift
store called "You and the Law" and it goes in to all sorts of issues,
tenant rights being one of them. 

Sorry folks, but both money and the law are on the side of the tenants,
like it or not.

What can I do to gain the privelage of spamming the company wide e-mail
system to gain marking lemming information? The lovely marketting manager
of my fine company just did this... and I *almost* had to be a sacastic
some of a beautiful woman and spam back with the extra fatty spam.... (=

Is it me... or are things getting extremely trivial and punchy...??? (=

Anyone go to the Winter Music Conference... I would have loved to check

ahhh, a lazy day today.  i love working on fridays, it's almost better
than having the day off - cause you get paid even though you're not
working...

well, ok, sometimes i gotta actually get something done on friday. 
but not today, looks like.  nothing to do but check my email...

nope, nothing...




damn, still nothing....







geez, yall are a bunch a quiet ravers out there today, whats up with
that?  well, i'm bored, and the list is awfully slow today, so if
anyone wants to chat feel free to drop me a line, i'll probably be
bored at work till 7 or later...


course an open invitation to chat is sorta hard to follow up on, i
usually get more responses if i say something interesting or
controversial.  so i guess i'll just throw some ice-breakers out to
you guys, see if anyone bites...


i've had telepathic experiences before, mostly on hallucinogens.

it's hard to plan falling in love, but i think if i ever get married
again i'd like to marry someone of a different race.

most californians don't like woody allen movies.  why is that?  i
think he's fuckin hillarious.

lately i've been noticing that there's this sort of attitude that guys
in the city cultivate, espicially in clubs and bars - it seems to
mostly express itself as a facial expression.  sort of a permanent
sarcastic scowl that says "i'm better than you".  it used to sort of
intimidate me, but the more i meet people who do it, the more i
realize it's just an act.

1015 is the nicest, friendliest, most laid-back meat market i've ever
been to.  course that's not saying much...

who do you think is the biggest asshole on this list?  if you think
it's me, i'd be glad to discuss it with you...

the village people were great.  imagine, they got a whole nation of
straight people to sing along with radio to songs about having casual
sex with other men at the young men's christian association.

god i need a massage.  anyone out there know a good massage therapist
in the city?



anyone?  anyone?



maybe i'll just take off a little early today...

see y'all at vibe this saturday!

some people on this list, you can tell they're jerks without ever
meeting them.  but i refuse to name names, and i could be wrong about
them anyway.  

sometimes i think being a bastard is attractive to others, in a
strange sort of way.  but i generally try not to be one anyway.

I thought the ';)' would cue you into the fact that
I was just teasing in the spirit of being (as you said) 'controversial'.

I guess my humor doesn't translate via listgroups; I merely wanted add a chuckle 
to your slow afternoon.

Don't worry Jonas, most people would agree, it's those bastard like
qualities that make Messiah so loveable...

Well that and any money you give him he swears is tax deductable.

He winks at all the girls and always asks if they want to make love with him.

 things about silly parties. have you been? 
 caito

The Silly party held last year in April was my first rave ever, but it is
still one of the *best* nights I have ever had, and not just because it was my
.. .firsT.. .. rave. When I compare it to some of the other parties I've been
to, it is still at the top of my list. The space they got was awesome, the
vibe was so thick, free bottled water, fruit and loTs of reAlly nice people. I
think that regardless of which party anyone chooses, you'll have an awesome
time I 'm sure. I'm planning on  being at Vibe This on Saturday ( my 1 yr rave
anniversary=*)... can't wait! afTer a stressful week, I deserve to busT harD
this weekend...

LoOking forward to hearing those pHat beats and spreading somE good vibes....!

Hey everyone, I'm back from No (Wo)man's Land and soooo excited about the
the scene right now, especially here in Sac (sorry if this is stuff you've
all heard before, but I've been unsubbed):

1.  There's a Jungle weekly in Sac now!  And it's _good_!  Jungle here has
often been quite horrible, but the resident DJ (dunno his name) is good &
they're booking some nice talent (Star Eyes was here this week).

2.  Who put this party (see below) together?  Whoever you (all) are, I
worship you!
   Saturday, May 30th - Fuz-E presents May Daze
   Omar Santana, Kelly Reverb, Jesse Brooks, Slim, Rockit, Catilist
   (live), Dennis, Ethan Miller, Micado, Andy W, Greg Sanders, Stillwind,
   Dre, Rinse, Flux, Noel, UFO, Sage, Star eyes, Simon Apex.
   916.484.4040

3.  Looking at the calendar, it seems as if hardcore is invading the bay . .
. woohoo!

4.  It's getting warmer . . . outdoor parties!!!  Are there any campouts
coming up?

5.  Hey, on April 19th I will have been raving for exactly 1 year . . . am I
still a newbie?  I sure feel like one . . . everything seems fresh & new
since I took a break from partying.

6.  I missed you guys . . . especially when Madonna's new album came out.  I
knew the list would be buzzing . . . was it?


xoxo--Miccaela

        I wasn't talking about the current state of the law, rather *if* we
lived in a society that respected property rights.  When it comes to
current law, Adder is clearly right.

Hey people, my very good friend Bekki is in a situation.
She can't leave her house until after 10:30 and she needs a ride to Vibe THis.
She's a very sweet girl for those of you that don't know her, and it would
really mean a lot to her and me if you could help her get to this party.  Her
house isn't too far from the freeway  and I know there's some raver laggers
out there that aren't going to the party early.  If you could help out or know
someone that could can you leave me a voice mail so I can work something
out???  
Thank you all so much!!!

Starchild, 

Perhaps you could explain to me how the current law does not respect
property rights. Am I not entitled as a tenant of a space that has been
zoned for dwelling, to receive "quiet enjoyment" of that property? Not
legally mind you, but "morally." How is that disrespectful of property
rights? If I am apartment hunting is it my duty to go to a prospective
apartment at 3 a.m. to ensure that someone isn't making a lot of noise?

> If I am apartment hunting is it my duty to go to a prospective

> 

Uh, I actually do this. I'll spend a weekend night outside my prospective
apartment to make sure that "problems" don't arise so that I am completely
informed of the environment that I may be moving into. Its just one more factor 
in the opportunity costs of renting/purchasing a given place. 

This may not be your's or anyone else's "duty" when moving into a place in the 
city, but for a person moving into an urban environment, (especially those that 
are BUYING their place of residence) it is almost essential to do this, in terms 
of saving one's self hours of grief fighting whatever inconvience exists in the 
area you are moving into.

Its a case of responsibility. Yes, you are correct that these people "should"
have the moral right to "quiet enjoyment", but they also have the responsibility
of investigating their environment. Imagine a lone person moving into the middle 
of an industrial area and he or she starts complaining about the noise and 
saying, "I didn't know it would was like this!". Although that person has the 
moral right to "quiet enjoyment", most people would just roll their eyes and say 
"you should have known better". 

Now the arguments about SOMA/VSF are more blurred due to the number of people on 
each side of the issue and with the money in the hands of the tenants, the 
tenants' argument at this juncture has more clout.


> Laying blame on the tenants of these properties is highly inappropriate. 


To say the tenants are blameless is way too strong of a statement to make.
It IS appropriate to attribute some blame to these individuals' ingorance.
Obviously, they are not fully to blame: there are the developers who bought up 
the area and built these units with no regard to the surrounding environment. We 
can also blame the city for allowing the zoning of all these live/work spaces. 
We can blame the police and public official's for being paid off by the 
developer's (did you know that 10% of a building's cost go toward paying off 
inspectors/official's/etc.) We can blame ourselves for not taking enough action
to help perserve these clubs. We can point fingers all we want, but what good
does that do. 

God, I am ram-bel-ling, its time to go.

Being way to didactic,

JoNaS

Sorry for the NRR. Sometimes I'll attempt to contact my old raving friends,
and they won't reply. This leaves me confused as to whether or not they
want me to continue communicating, and my paranoid side says they
just don't know how to tell me to buzz off. This goes out to all my friends,
past and present, on the list: I would like to know where we stand, and
I hope to always be known as a friend. Again, sorry for the NRR.
Peace,

I saw Mojo Nixon in concert a couple of years ago and he told us about a
drink he makes.  Just so ya know, Mojo Nixon is an maniac redneck
rocknroller.  You  buy a 2 liter bottle of Mt. Dew and a bottle of Gin. 
Dump half the Mt. Dew down the sink, and add the gin.  Shake until foamy.  

Something /very/ funny begins to happen. The chemical reaction between the
juniper berries in the gin, and the caffeine in the Mt Dew make you act
like a load, boasting, maniacal redneck.   Just like Mojo!

I call the drink Mojo Mixin'.

yeee, haw indeed.   :o)

<<most californians don't like woody allen movies.  why is that?  i 
think he's fuckin hillarious.>>

I'm not a native, but don't think i've ever watched a woody allen movie 
(or have i and just not known it cuz he wasn't starring in it?)

<< lately i've been noticing that there's this sort of attitude that 
guys in the city cultivate, espicially in clubs and bars - it seems to 
mostly express itself as a facial expression.  sort of a permanent 
sarcastic scowl that says "i'm better than you".>>

Ahh, yeeesss...it's called the "Please throw a Drink in My Face" 
look...very popular on the West Coast but also common East as well...and 
then there's the "Please Kick Me in the Shins" look, exclusive to 
mack-daddy's and quick-talkin' business men-types...and then also 
there's the "I'm Really a Loser but Wanto Look Cool" look, which is just 
WAY too easy to spot so it's being replaced by some of the more modern 
tactics of Club Mackking Technologie.. :)

<< 1015 is the nicest, friendliest, most laid-back meat market i've ever 
been to....>>


##begin club-whore catharsis##

...AS opposed to those mean, hostile, competitive meat markets, right?  
;)  <blink blink>  **sarcasm alert** :)  You know, those kind where you 
walk in and you're instantly insulted by the biggest jock you've ever 
seen, followed by a few drinks on your blouse by some other cheezeball, 
with some snide sexist remarks on the side to even out the whole 
experience...yes, those laid-back meat markets sure do beat that any 
day...just gimmie some slimy conversation with that Don Juan over there 
and enjoy the disco music at 1015, right?? :))

##end club-whore catharsis##

Well, this was an open invitation for sparring, right Messiah??  hehee
Too bad I'm not much of a boxer.  ;P

:D :D :D

Hey I was wonder If any one had ever thought of having a rave that the theme
was Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory? Maybe this had already been done.
Has it? Well anyways i thought about it and gawd it would be so rad. For
visuals you could use like computer generated scenes from the movie or
anything like that. And then for decorations there could be those big colorful
flowers and anything else bright and colorful from the movie. Well what does
everyone think?

That would be SO kick-ass. (:  I recently watched Willie Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory for the first time (I'm deprived, I know) a few weeks
ago, and I was telling all of my friends how cool it would be to wear a
costume like the Oompa Loompas in the "shrinking room"... you know, white
suits and the orange pom-poms on the shoes. :D
I'd be down for it!

Not once in my entire message did I say anything about drugz
or entheogenz being bad. My end quote iz The most violent
element in society iz Ignorance.

I'm sorry paul, and I apologize that you are too ignorant
to see that I just want to  point out that Drugz are
not bad, people make drugz bad by not educating themselvez
about them prior to uzing them. I thought that by perhaps
calling attention to the Binge/Purge cycle that every other 
raver seemz to fall into, we might take steps az a community
of raverz and help each other avoid the addiction pitfall.
Perhaps someday you will open your mind and heart az 
totally az you believe it iz opened now...

P.S. I know all there iz to know about shroomz...Am willing
to be taught about DMT, Ayahuasca, 2-CB, or Ketamine though (^_^)

Yeah, they had a massive WW party in LA . . . but it's still a cool idea.
I'm mean, how many parties have been named "CandyLand" or "ToonTown" or
"Fantasia" or whatever?  So I'm sure there could be one more "Willy Wonka &
the Chocolate Factory."

But the problem w/ parties named after movies and other such stuff is that
they never seem to live up to the name.  You think you're going to this
super-happy party with all these cool visuals and blah blah and you just end
up at another ol party like any other ol party and you put all that glitter
on for nothing.  Kinda sucks.

Well, thanx fuzzy for getting some of the peeps from the list out to Sac,
and getting some great yay area folx out here too.  We need some new blood.
I'm really looking forward to this event.

You know, having a small scene is cool except that it gets old seeing the
same people hearing the same djs at the same locations.

Rant:  what the fuck is up w/ Sacto parties being $20?  A $20 party with
mostly local talent and only 1 room?  What the hell is that about?

Actually there is a friend of mine who is supposed to be throwing an
Oompa Loompa party sometime this summer. This person has a thing for
outrageous and extravagant decorations so if the party actually happens
then you can count on it looking amazing.

hello all.......

Ok well if anyone was wondering why they couldn't find me it's because
my plans got SCREWED !!!!!!! I made plans with Michael (Who was helping
set up but they didn't even know who he was, as they said to me) and my
friends lagged so along with missing Mike to get my tickets, they
wouldn't let us in and didn't even know who Michael was... I feel like
I've let a friend down and I think I have.... I was is the worst mood
after standing there for half an hour in my cold arse adidas outfit
waiting that hopefully Michael would come out... I feel at my lowest
ever because I messed up and now in my part I need to pay Michael back
the 30 bucks he spent on tickets that I never picked up because of my
own stupidity : ( I'm sorry Michael for not being there when I said I
would... Didn't get there till round 11:45pm and I feel hella bad : (
Well there goes another chance to meet people......

Depressed,

Drakonis

p.s. I think I recall someone telling me that they would have a curious
george backpack and wearing black (and blue jeans) and I saw her before
she went in.......... I had the Black Adidas Jacket on and looked
mad.....

All I can say is Wow.

It had been a while since I'd been to a party.  My [non-raving] boyfriend
wanted to go  "It's those DJs you've been talking about..."  And indeed - the
lineup was stellar.  It didn't take much to talk me into going.

When I arrived, Li and J-bot [?] were up.  Talk about starting my evening
right.  I hardly ever get to see Li spin anymore.  I picked a spot in front of
the decks upstairs and barely left the rest of the party.

Ethan went on next.  A seriously wicked hard 2 hour set.  Got the crowd moving
and screaming in a hurry.  Bustin a move behind the decks.  Ethan is my idol.
 =)

Not to be outdone, AndyW and C@weasel pushed techno to one of my personal
favorites, minimal.  I'd never seen the c@ spin before and lemme tell ya what a
treat.  I knew he must be something because I'd seem him booked at parties not
too long after he arrived from the UK.  Their styles went together really well.

Up last, Micron just stole the show though.  Playing harder than usual for him.
 Like some killa, killa techno... moving into some really nice bouncy trance.

I also got to see a bunch of my original raving crew.  That was a special
treat.

Supa special thanks to Dan, Terri, Andy, Li, Science and all yous Viberation
kinda people out there.  Truly a party of epic proportions.

Love,

Beth

Did anyone go to LOVE last night, I'd like to hear  a review- I was 
supposed to go, but ended up at FootLoose, when we heard Donald Glaude 
and Steve Loria would be there. Although Donald wasn't there**ugh** 
Steve had a great set and so did Jeno. The guy before Jeno was alright, 
who I think was Vince-And we took off after Steve Loria.  There wasn't 
really any kind of Vibe there, the people there were kinda just there, 
knowone was really getting into the music, and the location was weak, 
2nd and Jackson, YUKKI! It was 15 dollars, but they over charged for 
water---And some crack head girl went up to Steve Loria while he was 
spinning and put one hand on both records and stopped everythnig, 
--Damn, I thought he was about to back hand her, hehe....damn 
crackheads-  That was it, that was my night. And did anyone go to the 
free party which most of the Choclate Factory kids were spinning???

PeaceOut
*hugz*

Just to remenis a bit...   Sometime back in '93...   There was a party here in SF
called 'willie wanka's chocolate factory'   It was put on by some of my friends.
The guys from Juice (Mike, and Josh) and Sara Lee.   It was a cool party.  The
flyer looked like a 3 by 4 gold chocolate wrapper.   and there was even small bite
size hershey candy bars handed out that were preprinted with the info and the
party name.   it was a good promotion, but the party ended up to be at the Mission
Rock, and was kinda booty.    Lots of BS with sf spaces at that time.   But the
candy sure was good, I think I personally ate like 50 of those flyers :)    But
even though it has already been done, doesn't mean anything, cause it can
definitely be done better.      Follow your vision :)

Keep it real...   Vlad

Hi Black Adder,

        Assuming that the zoning near the clubs was changed to allow
residential units *after* the clubs had been operating, this action was
effectively violating their property rights by creating (as you point out)
a reasonable expectation of new tenants moving into a space zoned for
dwelling, of "quiet enjoyment" of their property at 3am.  (Although there
is a very strong argument to be made that someone moving into an apartment
near, say, 11th and Folsom should have known what to expect.)

        My view is that zoning is a violation of rights to begin with,
because it is telling you what you can or cannot do on your own land.  The
only thing that makes it remotely excusable is that it is already so built
into the system that people have made all kinds of economic decisions based
on existing zoning designations.

        Ideally, there would be no zoning, and I do believe it should be
the responsibility of prospective tenants to investigate the neighborhood
adequately before moving in.  This needn't involve going there at 3am to
see if somebody's making noise, just asking a few neighbors.

Much love,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

Happy 4:20 everyone.

Mercury goes direct today although it still has to pass
out of its shadow period...but i think most people will
notice a little easing of tensions now and fewer
communication and transportion troubles.

Although pluto is still retrograde for a while.

The sun moves into taurus monday... a time
to start enjoying all those earthy sensual pleasures
you have been dreaming about all winter. Happy 
birthday all you venus people.

Looks like we have a shasta party/camping trip coming
together in late may/june... if anyone is interested in joining
 a scouting trip sometime in early\mid may let me know.

Hey, I have a short promotional tape available for anyone looking for a hardcore
trance, hard house or downtempo (female!) DJ.  The tape has 15 min of hardcore trance
and 15 min of house.  I would be happy to mail/bring you a copy if you are looking
to arrange a gig at a party/weekly.  If you know of any promoters not on the list,
feel free to forward this message.  Please, promoters only as the tapes and postage
can get expensive.  Reply to me at this address.
Thanks!

  Thought this was another forward that could be applied as an alogorical
  to our scene... -LM

"Time..... a Fable"

Once upon a time, there was an island where all the 
feelings lived: Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and 
all of the others, including Love. 

However, one day it was announced to everybody that 
the island would sink, so all prepared their boats and left.

Love was the only one who stayed.  Love wanted to stay 
until it started sinking.  When Love was almost sinking, 
he decided to ask for help. 

Richness was passing by Love in a beautiful boat. 
Love said, "Richness, can you take me with you?"
Richness answered, 
"No, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my 
boat.  There is no place here for you."

Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by, 
"Vanity, please help me!"
"I can't help you Love.  You are all wet and can probably 
damage my boat," Vanity answered.

Sadness was close by so Love asked for help, 
"Sadness, let me go with you." 
"Oh... Love, I am so sad that I prefer to go alone!"

Happiness passed by Love too, but she was so happy 
that she did not listen when Love called her!

Suddenly, there was a voice, 
"Come Love, I will take you."  It was an elderly person.

Love became very happy that he even forgot to ask the 
name of the elderly person.  When they arrived to the other 
side, Love asked Knowledge who the elderly person was.

"It was Time."

"Time? But why did Time help me?"

"Because only Time is capable of understanding such 
a great Love."

P.S:  Time is capable of solving anything.  Things today 
may not have a solution but tomorrow you will find one!  
The time has come for us to stop tuning separate 
instruments and, together, to create a symphony.

Man did it go off or what???? This party definitely rocked, and all the hard
work the viberations crew and others(including me =)    was totally worth it!
I enjoyed seeing so many sfravers there, and I wished I would have had a
chance to stop and visit more inbetween working the party and partying after
that!  I am so tired, I have only had 4 hours sleep wich brings it up to 8
whole hours for the weekend.....I think I just may slip into coma tonight =)=)
I hope to see y'all at afterglo, my friend Lori is spinning that night and she
is soooo cool that you all will have to go check it out! Take care all, sorry
I didnt have more to say as of now..

WOoHoo!! Can We say DOPE DOPE DOPE DOPE DOPE DOPE DOPE?!?!?!?!

I LOVED THIS PARTY!! !YESSS!! Ok... So a bunch of my newbie friends I was
supposed to take flaked on me, and I ended up going alone, although I was
later joined by my friend Paige, who's visiting from Orange County.  It was
her first SF party and let me just say... SHE WAS IMPRESSED!! I was too... she
is now convinced that So-Cal doesn't even compare to our scene.  hehe
ANyways.. thanx for making her feel at home, although with Paige, I doubt
that's hard.

ANYWAYz.. I'm getting sidetracked.  I liked the set-up for this location.
I've always wanted to go to a party at that house, and I wasn't dissapointed.
OH YES!!! The Jungle room was so Phat with the cargo nets and blacklight art
and all the couches so you could just chill.  The dining hall (sorry.. main
room) had a nice set-up too, except the visual screens kept showing what the
computers were doing to change the visuals.  Was that on purpose??? WHo
cares.. It was all good!!  

   FREE WATER. FREE FRUIT.  Yeah.. you're making Trice happy already.  I also
like how you have the outdoor space the keeps the party from getting too hot
and has a dope ass view of the bay bridge leading over to the city with the
Berkely campus in front of you.  Hey, if anyone else got pictures of the
sunrise from the roof could you send them to me?? Mine didn't come out.

So Ah.. my two favorite sets of the night had to have been #1 ~~> Siphon for
OH MY GOSH!! DRopping that "rock the funky beats" track that my friends and I
have had stuck in our heads for over a month.  We'd been singing it everyday,
and when he threw it down we just had to go off.  Oh, and of course call for a
rewind!! YES!! that's the first rewind I've ever called in my life, and he
played it over too!! oh oh oh!! That just made my night.  #2 ~~~> goes out to
Micron for his INTENSE morning set... It was so beautiful and upliting..
especially since i love morning sets.  he had everyone going off so strong
that the party ran over I heard like an hour and 45 minutes???  yes.. and all
the other music was Phat too!

So this marked my one full year of actually raving and partying and i got to
reflect on it all and how much I've changed, and i couldn't have picked a
better party to do it at.  I had wonderful conversations with so many people (
you all know who you are) and learned so much about the people I party with.
It was a HUGE SFR turnout and I met a lot of new faces.  (I'm not even going
to TRY to remember them all)  I just want to say hi and thank everyone for
making it a beautiful party.  

I saw Mad good vibes going off from everyone and people taking care of each
other.  and I am proud to say our scene can produce a party like this one.
WHEW!! but seeing as how I haven't slept in 39 hours and 40 minutes, I'd
better go to bed so I'm all rested for school tomorrow on 420.  Hope everyone
had a happy weekend!!!

     hugs n'stuff,
trice the tekno diva

I gotta make this short cause I'm a slacker and I got hella tons of work
to do
tonight because of an unmentioned party which was great. I'd like to say
Vibe
This was a 9 (of 10) on the rumpshakin meter [ -1 off for the power
going out].
It was nice to see the Sanctuary crew holding the front line for rump
shakin
between the hours of 2am - 4 am. Nice tracks from Ethan (nice to hear
some stuff
that's familiar). Big flying bootie shakin vibe (is this possible?) to
C@Weasle /Andy/Li/Micron. Big props to the weasle/andy.. excellent
wicked techno tracks. A big hello to all the Sanctuary crew/all
SFravers.....

next one is Friday at Mihn's house. See ya there....
he'll post more info.[blatant silly plug]

*end vol.1 of rump shakin*

cheers,
N

Hello all......

The end...... by the time you all get this I might be kicked out of my
house and living on the streets so this might be the last time you hear
from me..... I'm at the lowest point in my life that I've ever been
before. I might not even be raving anymore because I might decide to
dissapear..... I don't even see why I'm telling you all this because
this isn't the place to talk about this.... Maybe I'll live.. maybe I
won't.... I don't really care and don't feel like dealing with my messed
up body anymore.... Or how much acid does it take to kill someone ?? I
mean in doses ?? Maybe I'll go to my last rave and do that.... Maybe
some of you will say you care and don't want me to dissapear... but most
of you have never met me and don't know about my messed up body or
life.... Sorry if I worry any of you..... especially Michael because
he's the only one on this list that knows anything about me... I'll get
you your 30 dollars soon Michael before I'm gone..... Maybe I'll be here
tomorrow and be ok.... and maybe I won't.... time will tell......

Farewell?...

Ryan

I had been to this location many times before, but not for a party. it was
kinda kewl to se it be transformed into this sort of kewl club/warehouse. It
is a perfect location for parties.
The music was kewl ( not very loud though ) the vibe was kewl, and i got to
see a lot of SFR peeps that i havent seen in a long timE.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~ 
i dont know if anyone remembers, but i'm still gonna do that SFR banner to
hang up at FOREVER. I just got the paints to do it, and got the design layed
out. Its sort of simple. all it is is a white sheet that says SFRAVES,
underneath says SFRAVES@HYPERREAL.ORG, and around it has a whole bunch of
these kewl swirl things. If anyone has any ideas as to what we can put more on
it, something different, let me know. And if anyone wants to help out let me
know too.

Come One Come All!!!!!

if you didn't know about SFRaves IRC chat room, you can now consider
youself informed.

WHAT IS IRC? Internet Relay Chat (chances are, if you have an internet
service provider you can get irc)
PURPOSE OF SFRAVES CHATROOM (talk to people on SFRaves without having
to  solely rely on the e-mails)
HOW TO IRC...
Specs: If you have a web browser you can download IRC from the WEB at NO
COST TO YOU...
first go to <a href="http://www.mircx.com/">an Mirc WebSite</a> and
download it (if you have a PC, download "mIRC" and if you have a
Macintosh download "Ircle")
follow directions as listed, and next thing you know, YOU'RE ON!!!!
ONCE YOU'VE LOADED YOUR IRC CLIENT:
open the program.... they'll give you a list of options... read the
directions..... and you'll be on in not time...
REMEMBER THAT THE SFRAVES IS ON AN EFNET server.... (you'll know
whatthat means later)
and the channel name is "#sfraves" (yes, the pound sign included)
keep working on it...
if you're on AOL your special server is irc02.irc.aol.com USE IT!!!!!!

ok, well I hope to see you peeps there soon.
it can get fun and your added participation can make a phat conversation
forum for those with "Partying on the brain"
if you have any questions....

or e-mail me here...
hope to see you there...

Dude, that message is so downhearted. Maybe you were joking just a little? I
really hope so because when things are at the lowest point, and you think that
nothing can get better, something creeps up on you in a surprising way to let
you know things will get better. There is a lot of love here for you, for
everyone. No one wants to see you hurt or sad or feeling like this has to be
the end. I am posotively sure that there are lots of people who can help you
out, in many different ways, because we DO care. =)  If you would like to
talk, or just yell a little ( sometimes it helps)  gimme a call sometime.
Maybe you can tell me exactly whats happened to bring you to this, and maybe
we can all figure out how to see some sunlight in the situation. 
408-995-5340 home
408-581-4521 pgr. 

Take care bro, s'all gonna get better......

I don't even begin to know you, but sweetheart please don't feel so sad.
There is a quote which gets repeated all over the place, so you have
probably heard it before: "this too shall pass"  I know it is trite as
shit, but it does have a truth to it.  The beautiful thing about life is
that it is never stagnant; change is the only constant.  If you can just
hang on for a little while I am so sure that things will look up.  I don't
know *your* life at all, but I have a confidence in the universe that for
every valley there is a peak. It can just be a hard climb back up that
slope.  Sometimes however, you just have to own the depressed times, and
accept that is who you are and how you are feeling right now.  But at least
it is yours.  My last thought is that there is no shame in wallowing in
self-pity every once in a while.  It can be really good for the soul.

I know where you're coming from, I was there about 2 years ago.  
Life sucked the big donkey and I was thinking about turning to 
the darkside of the force, but instead, I sought an inward source
for help.  During the retrospection and reflection on my life, the 
only thing that could help me, was myself.  I got off my fatass,
went down and applied for a job, I went in, got an interview and
they practically begged me to work for them, they hired me on
the spot.  But life was still hard from then on, but you can only
deal with what is given to you.  While right now my life could be
better, I deal with what I can, and make the most of what I have.
It's all in what you do with it.  Make it so, Number One!

Don't get me started!  >=?
Andrew and I headed for the T&J factory pretty damn late but we 
figured hey!  it's a party so it'll go until real late.  So if we get there
about 1 or so, it should be coO.  WRONG!  We got there and there
were some directions to a party about 5 miles away at some guys
house.  We banged on the door for about 20 minutes.  The lights 
were on, the pooter was on, and the gates were closed and locked.
So we figured that they were still there.  I really wanted to go to this
party.  There were some directions on the door, which we followed
but were very confusing and we got lost but I eventually got there.
We get there and things are looking OK, but then we walk up and 
look around, and some little cutie asks me if I know where this party 
is and hands me a flyer...  for VIBE THIS!!  FUCK!  FUCK FUCK FUCK!
So we get in the car all bummed out because I know this party was going 
to kick my ass for weeks, and headed to get something to eat.  Then
we went home and played Tekken 3 for about an hour before I went to
sleep.  Can't get enough of the Tekken Ball mode!  Yeah, let's stop
fighting and play beach ball!  =)  but that doesn't make up for the fact that 
I missed such a bombass party!  

guess I'll see you guys at afterglo tonight.

Many of us have been thru some incredibly difficult times,
and many of us have been to the point of suicide. It seems
everyone always offers to listen which is nice but if you're
like me sometimes talking just doesnt help much.
So i think we should organize a new raver FUNd to help out
our fellow raver that might be having a bad time.
Im going to call it barf...Bay Area Relief FUNd.

We can use it to buy a sad raver something to cheer them up
or maybe take then to a good party to revive their spirit.

So next time you see someone passing around a B.A.R.F. bag
please make a contribution.

ps to drakonis...if you do get booted from your house and need
a place to come get a shower or set up a hotmail account for your
email,etc, let me know...anyone else too.

First off it's people like you that are on this list that make others
want to leave the list. I was asking a question, because I'm a curious
raver seeking insight. Not a rude response. Also why would I want to
represent the bay area when it's filled with people like you, that can't
accept other opinions, and take a simple quetion and totally turn it
around on the other individual, when all they were trying to do is ask a
question and be more enlightnend on a certain subject matter. I would be
so  ashamed that I'm part of such a cultural. 
Thank you for nothing and insulting me.

hello.
so I went on my first boat party yesterday and I must
say it rocked, both to and fro.

I made sure to get some photos to send back east to
make my friends jealous enough to come out and visit
me(where else are they gonna party while on a boat
enjoying the beautiful views that we take for granted
in San Francisco).

I loved the accessories that some of the people wore
to the party especially the girl who wore water wings
and another who wore scuba gear, I'll know to get
more creative next time I go.

This is why I love theme parties more than your
average just go and dance party.  You get the feeling
that everyone is one the same wavelength, and makes
you feel almost conspiratorial, like if only the rest
of the world knew how much fun we were having.

I was sad when we pulled in the dock at 12:00 pm, I
could have gone for another 2 hours but was spent
enough to call it a day.

If any of you went drop me a line and tell me what
you thought of it.  I got to work on a new sfraves
laminate, one that you can see under club lighting.

victoria,

i responded to you privately because you wrote me (a not so nice e-mail) 
privatly, but i think my opinions are just as important as yours & as 
everyone else's so i'm writing this to the whole list.  i don't think any 
one had any intention of insulting or offending you when they responded 
to your post.  it's cool if you want to go to denver & know how they 
dress/how they dance/what the parties are like, but the best thing anyone 
could ever do at a party is be THEMSELVES!  the greatest thing about this 
scene is that it supports inividuality.  yes, there is this whole deal 
with kids dressing alike (thw little adidas whores running around in 
baggy pants - i'm at school in the south right now & that's the biggest 
style right now) but if you bring your individuality, your own style of 
dress, your own style of dance, it's going to make the scene a much 
better place - and poeple are goinbg to think you're the shit for doing 
that.  i don't see where your nasty attidtue is coming from, especially 
since no one has acted rudly towards you.  before you say that it's 
poeple like ME who are making others leave this list maybe you should sit 
back and take a look at yourself, because it seems to me that you are one 
who is spreading a bad vibe.

ryan!

life may "look" ruf, but it's only an appearance.  beleive me, i may not 
know exactly what you're going through but i do know something similar.  
(i'm going to put my heart on my sleave for a little bit here.)  i've 
been the kind of kid who has always been driven, done well in school, 
gotten straight A's, known where i've wanted to go in life.  i went to 
marin academy, graduated with a 3.9, got sent off to DUKE, worked my butt 
off here, and only recently i've realized i have no clue where i want to 
go in life, what i want to do withmyself.  i had no moitvation to do 
anything. i came back from christmas break feeling so depressed.  i 
wanted to transfer to berekely so i could be in cali (i miss home so damn 
much)  i wanted to change my major to something easier (i don't know what 
i'll do with a math & econ major but who cares!)  i was so depressed i 
would just lie in bed & cry.  i didn't go to classes.  i slacked off with 
everything.  i stopped doing stuff in my sorority.  i stopped competing 
on the ski team (this is all stuff i was very active in before.)  my drug 
use went WAY up.  even though i am a weekend user, it would get to the 
point where i would be at friends houses after parties & just yell out 
what i wanted: COKE! CRYSTAL!  PILLS! and it would come, and i would do 
more.  of course ythis never helpoed my depression.  i felt unloved, even 
though i had so many wonderful friends around me.  i never really told 
them what was going on until recently.  i didn't feel i could talk to 
them, but i found out i could.  i told then EVERYTHING.  i talked to 
myself.  i figured things out, what i wanted what i needed.  i found out 
i really didn't love myself.  you can't expect any one to love you if you 
don't love yourself.  
what i'm trying to get at is even though i felt like i had no direction, 
that i was just fucking my body up (my body is perfectly fine by the way) 
it all got better.  i've pulled my grades up (thank god!), i've learned 
that i am a beautiful, wonderful, exiting person that everyone (including 
myself) should feel lucky to have around.  i've learned it's ok to not 
know what the future will bring - that it's more fun to watch it unfold 
and see all the surprises that come.  i've learned that life is always 
going to bring to bags full of shit, but you have to take them with a 
grain of salt & keep moving ahead.  i've also learned that there are 
poeple out there who love me & will always be there for me.  so if you 
decide to keep on keepin on, please call me (i'm long distance so you can 
call collect if you want or i'll call you back).  my number is 
919.613.0649.  i'll be back in marin in 3 weeks so you can get in touch 
with me at 415.388.7313 or page at 1.800.5.SPRINT, pin # 315.0414 anytime 
you want.  you do have people that love youy and care about you even 
though they haven't met you.  please think about that.

lovehugs&kisses,

amber

but you know when you are at the lowest point in your life, there is no
place to go but up.  it takes forever to get there sometimes making it seem
hopelessly endless, but once you smack your ass on the bottom, there ain't
no other direction you can head.  so, stop mushing your nose in the floor
trying to see further down and turn your head around 'cause that's the only
direction you can go now.

WOW eh?

The music was just incredible but so were the people!  It took me
about an hour to finally make it upstairs from outside.  From the
minute Nick and I got inside I just kept bumping into folks I'd either
seen 2 days ago or 2 years ago. It was just incredible.  Nothing like
gabbing over FREE water!

I caught Joe Rice set downstairs and he was amazing.  Great waiting in
line for the bathroom music indeed.  Oh and just in case I didn't
point it out to you Sat. night, I was the one who put the toilet paper
roll on the spinner dealie so all the raver kids didn't have to grab
it off the floor.  No really, you don't need to thank me.  Any Martha
Stewart wannabe would have done the same.

Upstairs just took my breath away. Took me forever to finally make it
up there, and it was worth it.  Just beautiful and best of all, it
never got too hot no matter how many people were packed in there
dancing to the music.  And the view from the balcony, WOWZERS!  I'm
sure the Fuji Disposable camera won't do it justice, but hey, we can't
all have the good Kodak kind right Elena?

Andy and c@weasel were incredible. It was great to just stop for a
minute and look at the crowd.  Everyone had a smile going.  Some folks
were getting down but others just closed their eyes and went with it. 
I can't believe how quickly their set was over.  Seemed like they were
only on for 10 min. but yes time flies when you're having fun.
Was only able to stay for the beginning of Microns set, damn shame I
know.

Oh, and Lacie, it was,
"Go eat poo. Okay?" ;)
Did anyone else notice that great graffiti by the bathroom stairs
besides Tony and I?

Tabitha

Two stories off the wire today about a substance many of you enjoy...

    JERUSALEM, April 20 (Reuters) - Israeli police found dozens of marijuana
plants in a flower-filled traffic island on a major highway in Jerusalem on
Monday.
    Police said they had no clue who planted the marijuana in the carpet of
flowers laid down by the Jerusalem municipality.
    Israel Television showed two plainclothes detectives weeding out the
illegal
seedlings as cars drove by on the busy highway. A police spokesman said they
would hunt for more marijuana on Tuesday.

    DETROIT, April 20 (Reuters) - A pilot flying a plane loaded
with marijuana apparently ran out of gas and was trying to find
a place to land when he was killed in a crash Sunday in a
Detroit school playground, police said Monday.
    Customs agents who were trailing the plane videotaped it as
it flipped over while trying to make an emergency landing in
Detroit.
    The pilot was identified as Douglas Dufresne, 66, of
Indialantic, Florida. Officials found 400 pounds (185 kg) of
marijuana in the wreckage.
    Three planes from the U.S. Customs Service in Texas had
tracked the single engine craft since early Sunday morning
after a park ranger in Big Bend National Park spotted it
crossing the border from Mexico.
    Police said Dufresne apparently ran out of gas after a
1,400-mile (2,240 kilometre) journey. He appeared to have been
looking for a place to land when he clipped trees and plowed
into the grass between baseball fields in back of the Noble
Middle School on the west side of Detroit.
    Witnesses at the scene said two people took bags full of
pot and cash before police arrived.
    Customs agents said they do not know where Dufresne was
headed but they had received clearance from Canadian officials
to continue the pursuit into Canada.

Hi,
Sorry to spam everybody ...

I think there are a couple people on this list from Honolulu?  I'm
gonna be out there this weekend, and I'm wondering whether there are
any good parties or weeklies going on Thursday through Saturday nights
- jungle beatz would be especially appreciated, but I'm interested in
any events featuring good local talent and friendly vibes!
Thanks,
Matt.

Hey...did anyone go on Sat.?  I was there!  I was there in all my
Markie-loving glory, cept I was the only one dancing for quite a
while....too long, actually,.... but I say "what the f**k, eh?"  Hard to
keep the energy up like that, though. : )

That house rocked...it just got better as the night wore on.... the vibe
was so thick, for me, anyway,

 I felt good energy pouring out of me like a fountain.

amazing.

Terri.

All I can keep saying to myself is WOW! 
That had to be the best party I 'we been to in the Bay Area by far. That
location was soooooo sweet. The combination of outside decks, sofas, cool
decorations/visuals, black lights etc., two different rooms and it lasted
ALL NIGHT LONG! The vibe was thick. My only possible suggestion might have
been the line at the bathroom and maybe a request for a house record now and
then. Hey, call me a house fairy. Yes , I was the tweaker you saw dancing
like a phreek in the total white long sleeve shirt black hat always bumping
into you and speaker humping like always hehehe. The people throwing this
one sure had an incredible location and thanks very much to that crew! I
loved meeting all you sfravers and hope we can do it again real soon.

Take care everybody,
-Josh

What's up,

    I was there and  it ROCKED (except for Garth's set which is always to
slow). I'm only going to go out once a month and that's the party I'm going
to. The vibe is great.

    Vibe This was tres fun.  But since everyone was saying how rad it was
[which is true], I'm gonna go into my gripes.  And I'm not criticising
shite, just putting out my opinion, know what I'm saying?

    Same location.  Sure CZ is k00l.  Well, it was the first time.

    Too many people, too many tickets sold.

    And I gotta say the musique was SOOO INTENSE.  I loved it, even standing
out back for as long as I did.

    But afterglo is what I'm lookin' forward to tonight.  Meganz and I are
gonna dance ... well I'm going to while she macks.  Anywayz.  : )

SFravers-

You guys rocked. You can't understand how amazed I was at the energy
you all created at Vibe This. Nights like saterday prove that through
it all, the underground is still the best place to be. Remember: We
may give you the space, but you guys are the party:) 

-Alex a.k.a. Science

ps- sorry to those who couldn't get in and those we turned away at the
door. We'll try to have presale tickets more widely available next
time, but even so, please remember that it's best to plan in advance.

thank you! thank you! thank you! thank you! thank you! thank you!

Thanks to everyone who made it out to "Vibe This!" last Saturday!

We are so *overwhelmed* by the show of support and good vibes!

Special thanks to:

- Our special guest DJs: Ethan, Cloud, C@weasel,Roman, and Joe RIce

- The hardworking and devoted crew who threw down like nobody's business!

- Gateway Systems, for bustin' out the thumpin' blue sound system last minute!

- Tony, Blake, and Scott for putting together the live webcast

- Most importantly...*all of you*! You made the party, and you all are the
reason that we put our heart and souls into every event we do.

I'm sorry for those of you that didn't get in, we sold out pretty early.
We'll get presale tix out earlier next time I promise.

As for us, it's back to the drawing board once again to see what new ideas
we can come with for next time. And as always, we love to hear your
questions, comments, suggestions, and concerns...our email addy is
viberation@saturn5.com

See you at Harmony's 5 Year Anniversary!

much love and energy,

The Viberation Crew

P.S. I still have a handful of Viberation T-Shirts, contact me if you want one.

It may seem odd to see "No on E" posted to a rave mailing list, but if you

  Vibrations party, Vibe This, was a night that changed my life. It was
definently the best party I have ever been to. If anybody has any
information how I can stay in contact with the people at that party or
attend more parties with the same people I would love it. Harmony and
Vibration obviously know how to create the perfect vibe. Anybody who has
gripes about the current rave scene should attend a party like this.


      Love to everyone,

    Lori was FUCKING INCREDIBLE.  Oh dear, I couldn't stop and I didn't dare
hold back.  : )
    The rest of the DJs were tres rad.  I'm kinda tired so I won't go into
details.  But like I don't think I've had such a good time at afterglo.  It
keeps getting better every time I go!  : ) : )  Many props to those boiz
that throw it.  : )
    And like ..... I had a good time.  : )

-->Hey folx,

	Sorry about the postponed party last week, but I wanted everything
to be perfect and well, Martha Stewart just would not allow me to have a
housewarming party without all the curtains up :)  
	The BBQ is happenin' this Friday (4/24/98) in the afternoon 'bout
2 or 3-ish until about midnite.  I want to turn the system down cuz of the
neighbors, and cuz I know y'alls have got places to be and ppls to see on
a Friday nite...so don't overdo the raver-time-tardyness okay?  There will
be a full on system with tables and mixer'n'stuff (courtesy DjNick--mucho
gracias amigo) so bring some vinyl or CD's for some fun toons (the earlier
you show--the more likely you'll get to play).
	It is a BBQ, so BYOB [Bring Your Own Beef], or if everyone forgets
to, we can always combine some funds and make a run to the store.  I will
have some food available, but  there won't be enough for everyone. The
directions will be posted shortly, but if you desperately need to get in
touch with MOI, my voice # is (510) 234-9038.
	Hope everyone had fun last weekend at whatever, but this Friday 
show-up to my party dammit, cuz it will be the bomb :D	


:)
M&m--a.k.a "The Minh"


PS	Martha won't be able to make it to the party cuz she promised to
help Hilary revamp the white house's, er, bed-curtains....

Well, I havn't posted in a while due to massive panic/stress/fatigue overload.
I'm preparing to test for my 3rd dan Black belt, and it's killing me.
(literally)

So, today, I had just finished training for six hours straight, when I left to
find that sombody had hit my car, and drove off without a word.  Well, I was
so tired that I didn't have the energy to get angry, but was too frustrated to
go to sleep.  So I drank way too much coffee and headed to afterglo.

And as soon as I heard Lori's phat beats, and met Elenas eternal smile(thanks
girl), all my problems just seemed to melt away.  Haaaa... a short escape from
reality makes everything so much easier to bear.

Hippity hoppity frogboix kickin to the moon.

Yes, we are a go. We went down to the site this weekend to survey the
area (again) and took some really nice photos. We're scanning them and
are going to put them up on our website. I'll write to you guys and gals
in a few days to give you the url.

Everything is exactly the same, except our live PA 'Random-J' will not
be joining us this time due to scheduling conflicts, but despair not!!!

We have just added Confluence to the lineup. Confluence is a new live
drumandbass act from here in socal. They're stuff is very techy, dark
and intricate. Goooood gooood stuff, and as far as I know, the only
local hard jungle set out there!

We'll write back to you in a few days with the new url, the automatic
remailer and some other info as well as directions a few days before the
event.


Look forward to seeing some sf peeps down here to reprezent!  I'm
playing at 4-5 under the stars so come up and say hi!  (playing at my
own party?)

Crystal Nitrous
Fox Interactive makes good on promise to sign major techno band for shooter

Talk about name brands! When Fox Interactive debuted its impressive 3D shooter 
N2O: Nitrous Oxide earlier this year, its visuals were fantastic, but the music 
was -- well, placeholder. The reason for the temporary music was the fact that 
Fox Interactive was in the process of signing on major music talent to compose 
the soundtrack.

That major music talent is Crystal Method, the hot new Bay Area-based techno 
band, whose tunes have shown up in everything from dance clubs to car 
commercials. Crystal Method will be providing 10 original and remixed tunes, 
including "Busy Child," "Keep Hope Alive," "Now is the Time," "Trip Like I Do," 
"Vapor Trail," "She's My Pusher," "Cherry Twist," and "Comin' Back."

Next, Crystal Method will appear on a wall in Peoria and be instantly hailed as 
saints.

Perhaps they didn't. Perhaps they couldn't afford or find anything else.
Been apartment hunting lately? It is neither easy nor cheap. We could
engage in speculation all day, however I don't think that it is really the
issue.

Let's examine that line of reasoning for a second. By having no zoning, I
could open a concrete factory that ran 24 hours a day, or how about 
a garbage dump right next to your property and that would be ok with you
since it is after all my property?

Zoning laws, right or wrong(or however misapplied) exist for a reason, and
sometimes they are good reasons. I also feel that if many of you who are
railing about your rights to dance would quickly change your opinion if
you found yourselves unable to sleep at 3 a.m. due to noise.

	Had a blast on the sunset boat party.  MC Fluid and vocalist
Gina tore shit up in the jungle room upstairs.  INCREDIBLE!!!  Met a
cool girl named Janelle from San Jo' and we both love dj M3 (Manny).
Was wondering if anyone knew her since I was pulled away by friends to
go see some other peeps.  Anyway, could you please tell her I said sup
and aloha to Manny.  I'm out...peace be with you...

	Aloha,

this is a call out to any promoters looking to bring in a really good 
dj.  i got a mix tape of dj dmx from denver, co a few weeks ago & have 
been listening to it for a while.  his tape just blows my shit up (pardon 
my language.)  to quote his style "acidy funk 2 breakbeat fever with hip 
hop skeelz", this boy can work it & i'd love to see someone bring him out 
to the sf/bay area this summer.  his e-mail is argyboy1@hotmail.com, you 
can view his website at members.tripod.com/~three_oh_three.  i don't have 
his voice mail on-hand but if you want it, e-mail me & i'll get it to 
you.  

lovehugs&kisses,

hello folks

i just wanted to say thanks to everyone for this awesome wonderful time i
had at this party saturday night. sheesh, ive never partied in a dorm room
before, very weird

i dont know if i met many sfravers, i know i met a handful. who was that
guy that was chilling with me and adam on the roof waiting for the sunrise?
with the goatee, is he an sfraver? but i met very many cool people, sfraver
or not. all you guys are very very awesome

are your parties normally this good? i felt like a virgin raver again,
meeting all these new people and hearing all these different djs, put
together with that kick-ass vibe. i havent felt a party like this in a long
long time. ive been so lucky, everytime i come up to the city, i experience
a damned good party. usually its also when i start burning out on the la
scene, sf events always renew my faith in raving and make me feel a part of
a global raving family. you guys have such a tight scene, i hope you
realize that too and enjoy it just as much as i do

the music was freakin (damn, im running out of decent adjectives
here-insert one of your choosing). i especially loved the variety. and id
never seen a 2x4 on techno before, wow! i loved that video game that kept
playing on the visuals screens every once in a while, the one with two
characters battling each other with their dancing stylees. i thought it was
tekken or something, but then i noticed they were dancing instead of
whipping out combos at each other, it cracked me up! what is that game, is
it on playstation? i want it! someone please help me out and tell me

ethan kicked ass and was my favorite of the night. i heard that guy for the
first time last week at f-8 and i was hooked. so glad i got to hear him
again. andyw vs. c@weasel (is that who that was?) rocked. so did siphon.
and so did micron, most definitely. thats all the dj names i remember, but
i loved every bit of the music that entire night

man, i dont know what else to say. i have such love towards you guys and
your scene, i cant even describe it. im so lucky to have been a part of it
for that one night

the viberation crew had such heart in this event, you could tell, it made
the good time that much better. if only more crews had such great intents

i dont know when i can come back up, i think not till july for the harmony
5-year. i cant believe you guys got adam beyer to come, holy fuck! but i
cant wait until i can party with the sf kidz again. is anyone coming down
for elevation and dune here in socal? ill definitely be at those, hopefully
i can meet you there

anyway, have a good week everyone and i look forward to seeing you soon

joe

ps
i especially wanted to say thanks to micron who helped make sure that i got
in. i was really worried i wouldnt and i didnt want to travel 400 miles to
find id missed the party. and also my friend diane, but i dont think shes
on this list. oh well

"and the messiah opens up with a sharp left jab" -> i've been on this
list for a long time, and recollection serves me, you post a lot of
reviews of nikita, which is at 1015, on friday night, right?  heck,
that's when the unsavory element is at it's peak.  does that mean you
secretly like such behavior?  i mean, you keep going back, if you
don't want to get hit on go to a rave instead...

just kidding, i don't want to pick a fight, really.  truth is, i don't
deny the slime element at 1015.  plus i know it's kinda different to
go there being a guy, women have told me they get pounced on pretty
bad.  i think it has a lot to do with what night you go, sundays,
mondays and wednesdays are _way_ more laid back than fridays and
saturdays.  plus, it also depends what room you're in, the front room
especially, and the main room to an extent, seem to be where most of
the ribbed t-shirt and gold chain types congregate.  i meet much
cooler people in the little side rooms.

i can understand your position, really.  you go cause you like the
music, but work too hard during the week to go on a tuesday night
instead of friday, right?  and to get to the cool rooms you have to
walk through massive crowds of scummy guido's.  believe me, i've
noticed their presence too, though for the most part they just ignore
me, for obvious reasons...

i guess what i was trying to say was, considering it's a meat market,
which it is, there does seem to be an element of pretty cool folx
there, even if they too are all trying to get laid...

That game everyone keeps talking about is called Bust-a-Move: Rhythm and Dance.
Not that retarded Bubble-Bobble game.  It's called Bust-a-Move here but it's 
been
Bubble-Bobble in the arcades as well as in Japan.  DON'T CONFUSE THEM!
Anyway, it's a game that involves play mechanics similar to Parappa the Rapper,
where by pushing certain button combinations, your character puts out a dance 
move
instead of a phrase, a la Parappa.  Push buttons and joypad combinations to
execute dance moves.  Good stuff, huh?  If you're diggin' on that J-Pop dealio.
But from what I hear through these news sensitive holes, is that the company,
Enix, is looking to sign some big name techno bands for the American release.
There are about 10-15 characters, each with their own look, dance moves and 
music.
Secret characters are revealed after completing the game in certain ways and 
with
certain characters.

I should be able to get myself a copy soon, so those of that are interested, 
invite me
over so we can get down and funky.  I'll post the list once I get it.

Your Jedi Bitch,
Jedi666Boy

(mad uncontrollable shaking) um karsten - you can't honestly mean
this? can you? anyway, i haven't even been to a rave where i wasn't
'hit on' by at least one person so i don't know where you come up with
this crap. and i'd think that natasha would get it worse than i do.

what is it they say? if you're not part of the solution.... are you
really not trying to pick a fight, k? ha. 

i wish i could see if you had some sort of cocky grin on while you
wrote this.... i just can't tell if you're full of shit or not?
unfortunately i'm afraid you're not, which is really sad.

> i guess what i was trying to say was, considering it's a meat market,

this says it all to me. "even if they too..." give it up, will you?
this list is not, unlike 1015, a meatmarket for ravers. [disclaimer:
great tho when you do meet someone you can actually hang with, but i
don't think that's why we're here.] try looking at others as possible
friends first, rather than as possible mates. please don't bring this
slimy 1015 element to the list, k?

and *call me* messiah [i'm at home today] coz i've been meaning to
talk to you about this very subject. i'd write more but i'll save it
for the phone. anyway we have to go thrift shopping (and book viewing
and gallery hopping....)!!!!!

cheers - e. :)

i can't really add to all the props that have been thrown the way of
the veberation crew - you guys all did a fabulous job.  the crowd was
a bit on the collegiate side, but what did i expect? ;) great to meet
all of you new to me - ethan, joe (you will be joining us for lunch,
no?), guy (what a gentleman), terry (hats off).... and disfunctional
michael i believe i have something that belongs to you?? last but not
least, great to finally hear you spin live jon and andy (the double
ewe - so cute! ;) and i'm glad i stepped up and said hi dan - you
ought to try it sometime. ;) and good to see all you guys from nicks
and epiphany! so much fun. i'm actually beginning to feel like i live
here - the first party where i went and actually knew more than the
ppl i went with.  encore!

cheers - e. :)

*actually*....I haven't been to nikita in over three or four months.. if 
that, and  I don't think i've posted more than 1 or two reviews....to be 
honest, YES, it's for the music, but it's still pretty slimy and i'd 
*MUCH* rather goto a rave than be in the element of "wanna-get-laid" 
slimyboys....;)  And, if my memory serves me correctly, fridays at 
nikita are *way* different from Saturdays...don't get me wrong -- both 
nites are very "clubby" and i have *nothing* against clubs per se, but 
it seems to me that the "slime factor" might be wee bit worse on 
Saturdays :)  

and just for the record, no, i don't secretly enjoy such behavior... 
sorry to disappoint :)  And no, i don't keep going back , either....like 
i said, i haven't been there in months and prolly won't return unless 
like Paul Van dyk is there or somethin; :)  Nothing against the club 
itself, for all you 1015-ers out there, it's just not my idea of a fun 
time to get the full-on mack-attack when i go there, that's all :)

Oh, i don't even interpret you as trying to pick a fight!! :)  You're 
right, it's different each night of the week, i'm sure, and yeah, i'm 
sure it's different for a guy going there vs. a gal...I'm *SO* NOT 
offended, don't even think of it, really!! :D :D

hey, I can totally see your point - I mean, they *DO* get some kick-ass 
dj's to spin there, and yeah, i love the music, so i will withstand a 
night of macckin' just so i can hear the stuff that moves my soul....but 
i by no means enjoy that "i'm better than you" attitude you wrote about 
in your first post... :) 

PS Hey Messiah, WHERE WERE YOU Sat pm hmm??? ;)

Liz & I had a nice chat :)

I am new to the sfraves list and just went to my first party in a loooooong
time 
(vibe-this was awesome to say the least)

Let me get to the point.

My roommate is from England.  He is an excellent guy and has the most
excellent collection of the darkest dirtiest jungle/drum & bass i ever did
hear (dark european influence)  

Now he may never get the chance to spin his goods here.Yesterday, he was
arrested at work- handcuffed and taken down to INS.  They tried to deport him
yesterday without even getting the chance to go home and get any of his
things.

The whole situation sucks!  They won't tell us anything, we can't see him and
the problem is My roommate (a US citizen even) is married to the guy!!!!

I have a feeling that at least one of you intelligent caring people must know
a little something or know someone who has had this happen to them.  Any
information is helpful and appreciated.  As we speak he is sitting in a jail
in Oakland waiting deportation (probably not until tomorrow)

this is totally ridiculous

Let me know-
Merci Beaucoups,

stay sassy

I'm going surfing on my lunch hour just to catch a few waves that I
promised all the cool people I met this past weekend.  Hope the weather
is holding up.  I don't know what the fuss was about.  I came in Thur.
morning and it was so beautiful that I ended up riding around all day
with my friend on her scooter and just zipping around the city.  I'm out
for now...missing the Odwalla juices...peace be with you...

Aloha,

Hey, i thought you were going to be putting your ass on the line until the
crack of dawn.  No doubt you'd be pooped at the end of your set!  Butt then
again, the guy who told me that is kind of a bum you know, a real
dingleberry.  Don't ass me.  But I'm sure you'll spin a booty-ful set &
it'll be a wild rumpus either way!

Allow me to agree on all accounts.  He's a great guy,
and is almost ready to shake the SF drum & bass scene
to its foundation with his stacks of kick-in-the-teeth,
hide-the-children, whup-ass wax.

If he gets deported it will be a crying shame.

Thank you, Pete Wilson.

Steve.

i'm married to a non-us citizen and what ever is going on with your
housemate is ludicrous. does he have his green card? there must be
more to the situation than what you've written. i've been given hell
from the ins as has my husband, but he has never been carted off to
jail. if he got his green card and went through the proper channels
when he got married he ought to have the necessary documentation to
get himself out. however if he hasn't played by bureaucracy's rules,
he might have some problems. one thing i've learned is to save
everything - all paper work - everything. have documentation of every
step of the way and they can't touch you. anyway i can get you the
name of a lawyer if you need one - it sounds like you might. 

cheers - e. :)

Well...

If it wasn't obvious, my last mail accidentally went to about 450 more
people than intended.

Um... thanks for coming out to VibeThis and Afterglo... what a week (work
sucks ass today... air conditioning is on da fritz).  Last night was dope
with a good variety (house, techno, trance... of course they all go BOOM
BOOM BOOM but I think you know what I mean).  Thanks Lori, Greg, Sho and
Gerlando for a good night's grooves.

Now to find some sleep...

Peace,
AndyW

Its has recently been discovered that red hair is caused by iron
that is not present in other types of hair. I dont know the exact
biochemistry of this but perhaps one of our scientist types could
explain that. But anyway iron is also what causes mars to look
red and a prominent mars in an astrology chart especially
on the ascendent was found in 495 of 500 redheads. Mars has
always been associated with red hair and sex and vibrant
energy. So someone with a strong mars has a healthy life force
and therefore a stong sex drive and quite possibly red hair.

Or as robert heinlein said there is a special heaven for 
red heads and cats because they are both so special.
Or then again it could mean their brain are just rusting.

I think it should be painted to look like a ufo...complete with 
realistic aliens waving out the portals at passerbys.

And the paint used should be glow in the dark so that you have this
glowy van driving down the hightway at night...pulling up
at 7_eleven and having a bunch of candied ravers hoping out
to stock up on red bull and frutopia on their way to a party.

Also....

You could paint the car all green and have the hood panels painted like
black Alien Eyes.. (you know the ones).. very simply and to the point...
and not too gawdy. :)

Prysms into the infinence....

:P

see you there dude ... (also the rest of south bay family too) ... 

is it just me or does the south bay family just rock more than the east/north/west bay and the sf members of sfraves ... we are definitely closer to each other than the rest of them ... south bay rulez !!!

i am not sure what the west bay is but i just figured i would include it for completeness ...

Rudi

Well all I guess I'm ok now..... Eventhough I might be moving to
Pleasonton with a friend of mine because of all the drama that's created
about me out here in Martinez. Let's see just today I find out that a 12
year old girl is telling everyone things that aren't true and it's
worring me...... Well maybe I'll get to clear my mind this weekend if
the snow trip falls through and I get to go.......

Laters all and thanks for the letters of support.... they helped so much

Ok well my friend has this game (Japanese version) and it is one of the most
addicting games ever played...... I hate J-Pop but it is tolerable for awhile.....
hopefully our version will be teknoed up like people have requested....... it's a
VERY easy game to master though... took me an hour before I was able to beat
everyone and after that they couldn't stop me.... Gas-O kicks phat arse..... the
only semi breaker in the game.......

There were four people named Everybody, Somebody,
Anybody, and Nobody.  There was an important job that 
had to be done and Everybody was asked to do it.
Everybody was sure Somebody would do it.  Anybody
could have done it, but Nobody did it.  Somebody got
angry about that, because it was Everybody's job.  
Everybody thought that Anybody could do it but Nobody
realized that Everybody wouldn't do it.  It ended up that
Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what
Anybody could have done.


Man, doesn't it suck when that happens.  Hope ya'll had a good day.

OK this sucks of me I know.. But I have no clue where to look..


	I'm taking a child development class in which i have to observe an
infant aged 3-10 months old for approximately 2 hours. I don't KNOW any
3-10 month olds, or anyone who has one. So instead of running around from
daycare to daycare looking for a daycare willingenough to allow me to sit
in on a session, I would like to ask if any of you are mothers or fathers
of a 3-10 month old baby who would be willing to let me observe their
child before next tuesday..
	
	what's in it for you? free babysitting, as long as you need it for
that night/day/afternoon :) i love kids, wanna work with them forever..
and this class is just the beginning of my education with children and i'm
loving every minute of it! i'm not a freak, i promise :)

so please, if you have a 3-10 month baby and wanna share the joy.. feel
free to indulge me, and email me back.. or call me (408)782-0515

thanks tons!
lara
p.s. i promise not to make your kid listen to too much jungle!

this friday, april 24, for a very good cause.

i have been volunteering to organize a volunteer appreciation party for
the bay area chapter of the NAMES Project for the AIDS memorial quilt to
be held this friday.  it's an event to appreciate its volunteers during
volunteer appreciation week.  its a smallish affair, more of a social
mixer, and it's being held at the Foundation offices on townsend; about
75-80 people are expected, max.

i have everything is set to go, except that the person i had lined to
DJ,
just flaked on me. i could scream! (in fact, i think i did, but it's all
a
blur...:) 

so, if anybody knows of someone who is willing to donate their DJ
services and sound equipment, i would be one very happy, thankful and
relieved puppy. it's for a good cause and it's only for 3 hours. 

not feeling altruistic? well, you get free food, a free bottle of clos
du
bois,and you can get a tax write-off for the value of the services
donated
to the event. also, you could make lots of friends! (some of the
volunteers are very cute....;) 

i'd greatly appreciate any help and/or leads.

crossing her nail-bitten fingers,
lilia.

Yes.. yes .. I concur that the rump shakin front
which we set up in attack formation 10021 was quite effective
in creating enough good vibes to juice the entire system at Vibe This.
The magenetic field potentials alone from cerebral activity could
have totally Akiraed the whole set.

Great observation Elena..

-->Hello everybody...it's me again,

	Directions to mi casa are as follows: Take all alternate routes to
the 580 WEST...since many of you will be heading north from say berkeley
or oakland or from the peninsula, just go as if you were going to a sunset
at Pointe Molate.  You want to stay on the left two lanes to get to the
580-W heading towards SAN RAFAEL; there is construction at the 580/80
interchange so be careful not to miss it. You want to take the MARINA BAY
PARKWAY/ South 23rd street exit...they switch names, but the exit before
mine is Regatta Blvd so keep an eye out. You want to make a left from the
offramp, which will put you on Marina Bay Parkway.  You will pass three
signals (you will cross Railroad tracks...if there is a train you will
have to wait for it to pass; I know of no alternate route to my complex). 
When you see the sign "The Beach" slow down; MY COMPLEX IS "THE SHORES"
which is after "The Beach". Turn right into "The Shores" which will place
you onto SHORELINE COURT...make an immediate left.  Call me at 071 at the
box and I will buzz open the gate. The road will curve right and my apt.
is #62 on the second floor on the right hand side at the first curve. 
Apparently there are two #62's in proximity, but open your ears...you
should be able to hear the music. Park in any UNCOVERED parking space
available. It's not that complicated, but I don't want anyone to get lost.
My address is:

62 Shoreline Court
Richmond, CA 94804
(510) 234-9038


	The party will start at 3PM and there will be DJ's...not sure who
yet; it's open tables so SURPRISE! :) It's a mellow party but it will go
on rain or shine; if the BBQ gets flooded I have a fireplace and
marshmallows at your service :O


See you Friday!
:)
M&m


PS	In case you end up at a different #62, I have a green astroturf
doormat with a white plastic daisy on it :) Kitsch baby!

        There is an alternative to zoning; it is called common sense.  If
you're opening a business, you don't want to piss off all your neighbors,
and you're going to try to reach reasonable accomodations with people.
Furthermore, your examples are quite extreme.  I would venture to say that
99% of what people want to do with their property that is prohibited by
zoning would have less of a negative impact on their neighbors than opening
a garbage dump or concrete factory in a residential area.

        In the few cases where someone actually went ahead and did
something like this, they could always be taken to court.  Subjecting you
to regular doses of loud noise or foul stench that did not exist when you
moved into your property could definitely be considered a violation of your
property rights, and I think most judges and juries would be inclined to
look favorably on the plaintiff in such a case.

>Zoning laws, right or wrong(or however misapplied) exist for a reason, and
>sometimes they are good reasons.

        There is almost always a good intention behind every additional
measure of power and control exerted by government.  Very often new laws
are invoked as necessary to correct problems caused by previous state
interventions!  You say that housing in San Francisco is scarce and
expensive, therefore people cannot be expected to turn down decent living
places just because of a little late-night noise.  Instead, you seem to
imply, they should move in and then pretend they weren't aware of the
problem beforehand in order to press neighborhood businesses to change in
order to accomodate them.

        While I don't agree with this as a justification either for zoning
or for shutting down existing clubs, I admit that housing here is indeed
pricey and hard to find.  Yet scarce and unaffordable housing is itself a
problem created by other laws!  Homes have become increasingly unaffordable
over the past few decades, and it's largely due to developments such as
increased rent control, building permits, building codes, taxes and fees on
new development, etc.

        To simplify the model:  The more laws you have, the more fucked up
things get, and the more laws you "need" to fix things and make them right
again.

I also feel that if many of you who are
>railing about your rights to dance would quickly change your opinion if
>you found yourselves unable to sleep at 3 a.m. due to noise.

        Usually when I'm unable to sleep it's because of emergency
vehicles, car alarms, and public works crews who seem to enjoy tearing up
the pavement near my apartment with jackhammers before 8 o'clock in the
morning.  I've found these to be much worse insomniants (wordcheck?) than
the steady, low pitch thud-thud-thud of a sound system.

        Certainly emergency vehicles, if not the other items are recognized
as a necessary public good.  But why cannot raves be similarly recognized?
Surely the amount of happiness that is created is worth something to the
community.  I don't believe the few should be sacrificed for the good of
the many, but in a moral grey area such as we seem to have with the SOMA
neighbors-club dispute, the happiness of hundreds ought to count for at
least as much as the undisturbed sleep of one or two, wouldn't you say?

Much love,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

Here's the Question:

Can millions of people, focusing their minds on inner and world peace,
heal the world in an instant?

Can we, through scientific and quantifiable means, prove that we are
indeed the creators of the world we perceive, and that by changing our
perception, the world itself changes?


             This is "The Great Experiment."


It's time we prove scientifically what the saints and sages have
always told us- that we are powerful spiritual beings with the ability
to create a world based on the laws of love, instead of the rules of
fear. 

Two months ago, James Twyman, author of the bestselling book,
"Emissary of Light," was invited by the government of Iraq to perform
his "Peace concert" in Baghdad. The situation seemed desparate war
seemed almost inevitable and diplomatic efforts seemed to have failed.

"I was being used by the Iraqi government," Twyman said. "But we had
the same goal: to avoid this terrible war. I was given permission to
sing the Muslim prayer for peace to Saddam Hussein and I wanted the
world to join us in this prayer. Hundreds of thousands of people over
the world participated, and when it was complete, I felt a profound
shift in the energy of that whole region. Three days later, a peace
agreement was signed, something which seemed impossible before the
prayer vigil began."


             But The Story Continues . . .


"A week later, I was invited by the government of Northern Ireland to
sing at Stormout Castle in Belfast - the building where the peace talks
were being held. For days, bombs were exploding all around that area.
Many people were trying to interrupt the peace process and it seemed
like the talks might fall apart. Once again, thousands around the
world joined us in prayer, and three days later there was a
breakthrough in the talks. April 12, 1998, a peace accord was reached.

The evidence is there - we do have the power within us to change the
world. Scientists have measured the statistically significant effect
that focused meditations and events have upon the earth's energy
field. These effects were measured during the GaiaMind Meditation and
during Princess Diana's funeral. The studies show that the greatest
effects occur when groups synchronize their focus. During "The Great
Experiment," we will meditate upon specific affirmations in unison to
achieve the power of a singular group focus.

                 NOW IT IS TIME TO PUT INTO PRACTICE 
                   WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW TO BE TRUE:

"If enough people join their minds and hearts for peace, we can heal
the world."

"The Great Experiment" will take place on April 23rd at 6:30 PM
Eastern Daylight Savings Time ( This would be 10:30 PM GMT ) Please
mark your calendars now, and tell everyone that you know to join with
us.

James Twyman has been invited to sing the peace prayers from the
twelve major religions at the United Nations building in New York on
April 23rd. This presents an unparalleled opportunity for us all. Dr.
Doreen Virtue, best-selling author of The Lightworker's Way, and Gregg
Braden, geologist and author of Awakening to Zero Point and Walking
Between the Worlds, join James in conducting this incredible
experiment. Authors, entertainers, and other celebrities, will
participate by sharing their vision of "a world transformed by love."

Here's how you can participate:

1. Tell everyone you know. Share this with everyone on your mailing
list so that everyone can participate. Feel free to print this out and
make copies. The goal is to get as many people as possible focused on
this meditation.

2. Begin preparing your spirit and mind for the event by spending a
few moments in silence everyday. This will help build the energy.

3. Join at least one other person for the vigil on April 23rd. This is
an experience to share. "Where two or more are gathered."

The Format of the Meditation:

1. Opening:

Begin with this affirmation, said with great power and committment:

     I am an Emissary of Light. I extend this Light to all beings, in
compassion and love, knowing that they are one within me. this
moment the world is healed - and I along with it. I will it - and
it is so.

2. Then spend five minutes creating a sound (such as "Om") to carry
the spiritual energy and vibration. This can be done with a single
tone or by singing a song such as "Amazing Grace."

3. Spend five minutes in silence allowing your spirit to receive the
light and love which you yourself extended to the world.

4. End with this prayer:

     "It is done! I am one with all - and all is healed. Let love
reign where fear once was. I accept this for myself and for the
world. I am an Emissary of Light now and always. Amen"

Then, with reverence, bow your head and thank God for this grand
opportunity. The universe gives thanks to you for being part of this
great experiment.

Well, so, where would be the MOST perfect place to celebrate 420??  Well me
and some of my friends decided that we would like to go out to the woods and
camp all night at some beautiful spot, celbrate all night, and play some drums
and guitars and just mellow back with some beers (& tequila & goldschlager &
jegermeister &etc.) & of course, pot.  So we got there at this gorgeous spot,
a camping ground in the Santa Clara county, around 2 in the afternoon.  we set
our tents and just chilled waitng for that magical time.  When it arrived, we
hiked to Ga(ru)nja Falls and had a great minute.  Anyway.  Back to the WARNING
<> WARNING <> WARNING!!!  We told Mr. RAnger dude that we were kicken it all
night, not sure how many cars were going to be there, but fully intending to
pay for all those that showed up.  We had the camping grounds to ourselves.
Absolutely noone was on the camp grounds but us.  It was hell of cool.

Well, a few hours later, more cars showed up.  4 to be exact, there were 11 of
us kicken.  The Ranger dude shows up at 9:30 pm.  He says:  I smell alcohol.
Is anyone here over 21?  <we all stared dumbly at him> Okay :he says: I'll be
back in a minute <we all scramble to hide out liquer and beer>  He comes back
and tells us we are busted, makes us all give him our ID's, he runs us through
the scanner and all that BS.  comes back again and says: you all are in
serious trouble, you are all underage.  You are lucky noone here was over 21
becasue he/she would have been arrested for contributing to the delinquency of
minors.  I have backup coming up here, they will be here in a minute.  Get all
yoour alcohol out and gather it right here.  <so we all scramble, gather the
alcohol, hide the pot and pipes and bongs and such>  Mr Ranger dude #2 shows
up.  He says: Is anyone here sober enough to drive?  me and this (16 year old)
boy (who just got his liscence which is still a piece of paper) step up and
say we are.  SO I have to take a breathalizer test.  Damn! I almost ran outta
breath!  So, 4 cars, 2 sober drivers, 11 people.  Hmm.....  So we broke down
camp (by force) and packed up with me and the 16 yr old driving.  

Mr Ranger dude #1 & #2 made us have a nice long talk at the entrance.  They
said we are lucky.  We were the first people of the season to get caught
drinking illegally on the premesis so we would get let go with a warning.
But!!!  Because he had all our ID's, if we get caught again doing something
wrong in a county park we will get arrested and our liscences taken away.
Ranger dude #2 said he can write us a ticket anytime in the next YEAR period
of time for what we did that night. He told us to tell evryone we new what was
up.  They said they weren't going to let anyone else go.

<Then I had to drive back to town, call people who were sober and bring them
back to the campt site so we could get everyone and there cars home.>  that's
how my story ends.

so the warnings go as such...

1. Do not drink in a county park unless you are over 21, and everyone with you
is over 21.

2. Make sure you have enough sober drivers for cars.

3. Do not exceed the number of cars per site (we were only supposed to have 2
per site, but we were going to go back and get another site. no, really!)

4.  If you choose to drink, make sure you scout out good places to hide you
stash BEFORE the rangers come up to fuck with you.

Hope you all had a HAPPY 420 DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please READ this!!! It is VERY IMPORTANT!!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the Question:

Can millions of people, focusing their minds on inner and world peace,
heal the world in an instant?

Can we, through scientific and quantifiable means, prove that we are
indeed the creators of the world we perceive, and that by changing our
perception, the world itself changes?


             This is "The Great Experiment."


It's time we prove scientifically what the saints and sages have
always told us- that we are powerful spiritual beings with the ability
to create a world based on the laws of love, instead of the rules of
fear. 

Two months ago, James Twyman, author of the bestselling book,
"Emissary of Light," was invited by the government of Iraq to perform
his "Peace concert" in Baghdad. The situation seemed desparate war
seemed almost inevitable and diplomatic efforts seemed to have failed.

"I was being used by the Iraqi government," Twyman said. "But we had
the same goal: to avoid this terrible war. I was given permission to
sing the Muslim prayer for peace to Saddam Hussein and I wanted the
world to join us in this prayer. Hundreds of thousands of people over
the world participated, and when it was complete, I felt a profound
shift in the energy of that whole region. Three days later, a peace
agreement was signed, something which seemed impossible before the
prayer vigil began."


             But The Story Continues . . .


"A week later, I was invited by the government of Northern Ireland to
sing at Stormout Castle in Belfast - the building where the peace talks
were being held. For days, bombs were exploding all around that area.
Many people were trying to interrupt the peace process and it seemed
like the talks might fall apart. Once again, thousands around the
world joined us in prayer, and three days later there was a
breakthrough in the talks. April 12, 1998, a peace accord was reached.

The evidence is there - we do have the power within us to change the
world. Scientists have measured the statistically significant effect
that focused meditations and events have upon the earth's energy
field. These effects were measured during the GaiaMind Meditation and
during Princess Diana's funeral. The studies show that the greatest
effects occur when groups synchronize their focus. During "The Great
Experiment," we will meditate upon specific affirmations in unison to
achieve the power of a singular group focus.

                 NOW IT IS TIME TO PUT INTO PRACTICE 
                   WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW TO BE TRUE:

"If enough people join their minds and hearts for peace, we can heal
the world."

"The Great Experiment" will take place on April 23rd at 6:30 PM
Eastern Daylight Savings Time ( This would be 10:30 PM GMT ) Please
mark your calendars now, and tell everyone that you know to join with
us.

James Twyman has been invited to sing the peace prayers from the
twelve major religions at the United Nations building in New York on
April 23rd. This presents an unparalleled opportunity for us all. Dr.
Doreen Virtue, best-selling author of The Lightworker's Way, and Gregg
Braden, geologist and author of Awakening to Zero Point and Walking
Between the Worlds, join James in conducting this incredible
experiment. Authors, entertainers, and other celebrities, will
participate by sharing their vision of "a world transformed by love."

Here's how you can participate:

1. Tell everyone you know. Share this with everyone on your mailing
list so that everyone can participate. Feel free to print this out and
make copies. The goal is to get as many people as possible focused on
this meditation.

2. Begin preparing your spirit and mind for the event by spending a
few moments in silence everyday. This will help build the energy.

3. Join at least one other person for the vigil on April 23rd. This is
an experience to share. "Where two or more are gathered."

The Format of the Meditation:

1. Opening:

Begin with this affirmation, said with great power and committment:

     I am an Emissary of Light. I extend this Light to all beings, in
compassion and love, knowing that they are one within me. this
moment the world is healed - and I along with it. I will it - and
it is so.

2. Then spend five minutes creating a sound (such as "Om") to carry
the spiritual energy and vibration. This can be done with a single
tone or by singing a song such as "Amazing Grace."

3. Spend five minutes in silence allowing your spirit to receive the
light and love which you yourself extended to the world.

4. End with this prayer:

     "It is done! I am one with all - and all is healed. Let love
reign where fear once was. I accept this for myself and for the
world. I am an Emissary of Light now and always. Amen"

Then, with reverence, bow your head and thank God for this grand
opportunity. The universe gives thanks to you for being part of this
great experiment.

my first party in a while, and it went OFF. terrific visuals ("vibe
inside" Intel logos, giant Lego spacemen, video mixing), really beautiful
music, and super friendly vibes. much love to all the sfravers I saw there.

dunno what else to say -- I had a blast. next time Viberation throw a
party, I'm going. I was still smiling when I went to sleep.

I've been reading a lot about how the mind works recently, especially
about a neat model of the mind called NLP. I just finished a very good
NLP book tonight which had a section on how to re-experience drug states.
the book basically gave step-by-step instructions for how to bring back
any previously experienced drug state.

so I tried it. BAM. I was high. then I just turned it off and I wasn't
high anymore. it was unbelievable. for one thing, just being high was fun.
(I mean, it usually is.) but also, if you've ever had one of those
mind-expanding experiences where you notice new possibilities, you might
know what it felt like. you just experience a really exciting sense of
possibility doing this, because you realize your high is completely up to
you.

now, here's the thing. I want to get good at this stuff. teaching people
how to do it themselves is one way to get good, so I'm wondering: would
anyone be interested in learning how to do this? If you are, grab me at a
party if I'm there (I have a green A's hat which is practically glued to
my head, I wear it so often) or e-mail me offlist. (I get the digest, and
I don't always read the whole thing 'cause the volume's so high.)

Here's one for ya. I got busted for mountain biking in Alum Rock Park
(not even real bikin- I was just bored). I got the cops and the whole bit.
They didn't post when the park was going to reopen and it had been like
2 and a half weeks. The sign said closed due to storm damage. There were
even people walkin down there. Did they get busted no.

The "law" is subjective. Civil disobedience was in order. From
my experinces climbing for 10 years. I've gotten to know a few park
rangers from Joshua Tree to American Fork (Salt Lake). They're serious
dudeskis/dudedalas with nothing else to do. In your case, you're definately
lucky. I've seen em cuff and stuff people. Let the baseheads steal shit and let's
harass all the climbers... it seems to be their fav theme. But I shouldn't bag on
em too much cause they helped me rescue this one girl who was really badly
injured in an isolated area (due to her own stupidity). So they are okay some...
(as was the case with you) but most are just silly. I guess sitting out in an
isolated
area can do that to a person. Oh well...

Just a quick word on zoning...

The reason zoning ever existed is because of the health crises and
overcrowding of  modern cities. Without it, people lived in overcrowded
conditons, near garbage dumps, etc., etc. New York City's government
finally in the late 1890's-early part of theis century (my dates are
probably wrong-i can not entirely wrong) had to impose zoning to force
developers to stop forcing people like rats in a lab experiment in
unsafe tenements in unsafe areas.  Yes, zoning is frequently used today
to protect other experiment but to say people won't build bad housing
because of common sense is forgetting the power of people's greed.  Go
to a city that grew fast without zoning like Houston  and you will see
huge skyscrapers on lots smack in the middle of a small residential
neighborood with nothing else around it to support the office poeple in
them and of course, they are frequently empty but the people around them
have to live it.  Zoning is a good practical thing and like everything,
it can be turned into a politcal tool.  But for all intents and
purposes, it does more good then harm.  

my 1.00 (adjusted for inflation),

Cassandra

Well it's official! We are a registered camp at burningman!! I requested 
space for 45 people and have room for tables, speakers and generators 
(if we want 'em:-) (if we end up with more than 45 people we can 
reajust)

The dates are: aug31--sept7
The cost is: $80 now and $100 at the door (plus food)

You are responcible for getting your own tixs however I will be sending 
my money in around may15 and would be willing to send in others as well. 

Ms. tabatha is a BM native... so she'll be our guide. I would like to 
have a really groovacios Kamp.

We have two ways of doing it.  A: everybody fends for them selves as far 
as food and krap is concerned. or B: we can actually plan having 
meals/food for everyone and everyone pays a community food and splits 
the work evenly?? I don't mind coordinating it but I do need to know

Here we go... the email you've been waiting for...
(or not)

One last time:
WHO?  those that responded to me are -
rick,frogboix,lacie,mook,rudi,andyw,me...  a small, but power packed
lunch group!
WHAT?  Picnic Lunch (bring your own- i can only make so many P&B
sandwiches in a day)
WHEN?  1pm  (that's not raver time... it's "i have a job that i'd like
to keep" time)
WHERE?   Central Park near Kaiser Permanente Hospital
we will try to meet right where the park meets the road meets the
hospital- got it?  just look for a group of funky lookin' people
basking in the sun! (around 1:10- we may delve deeper into the park!)
HOW?   why that's your problem!  ;)

DIRECTIONS: (compliments of our favorite jedibitch)take 880 south to
280 north, then
head north until you reach saratoga ave exit, now
there are 2 exits for saratoga off the same offramp.
take the first one that turns right, the other one loops around.
that is bad.  don't take that one.  ok you get off the 
freeway, then make a left on Kiely, it's like the second light,
and follow Kiely down until you see the park on the left, i believe.
It's right across the street from the Kaiser Permanente Hospital.

see you there!

NOW GET BACK TO WORK!
;)

heres another helpful story since we are passing out good advice
today:


A foursome was on the last hole and when the last golfer drove off
the tee he hooked into a cow pasture. He advised his friends to play
through and he would meet them at the clubhouse. They followed the
plan and waited for their friend.

After a considerable time he appeared disheveled, bloody, and
badly beaten up. They all wanted to know what happened.

He explained that he went over to the cow pasture but could not find
his ball. He noticed a cow wringing her tail in obvious pain. He went
over and lifted her tail and saw a golf ball solidly embedded. It was
a yellow ball so he knew it was not his.

A woman comes out of the bushes apparently searching for her lost
golf ball. The helpful male golfer lifted the cow's tail and asked,
"Does this look like yours?"

That was the last thing he could remember.

i dont really understand what all the hype on crystal method is all

theres tons more talent out there that basically get no exposure for

My stupid car is driving me nuts!!!
It's taking me all day to get the body work done and deal with the car
insurance boneheads.

Talk about bad car karma, now my horn honks whenever I make a left turn!!!!!
And for the past week, my damn turn signal goes on whenever I put on the
breaks!!!!

Oh god!!!!  this is getting so redicilous that it's funny.  Ofcourse,
everything in my life is like that.
I guesss this is what I get for buying a 67 squareback.

Hey Elena, sorry if my car karma rubbed off on you at afterglo.  You can have
my Ferrari liscence plate cover to make up for it.

I think I'm going to go hook kick some of my student's heads off to relieve
some frustration.

Did you guys forget that today is Earth Day?  I bet most of you did!

I had a great lunch today, thank you all for showing up.
Big thanx and a big hug to Megan for kicking my ass.
Rudi made it in the daytime, Woo Hoo!  1pm.  (He got there before me!)
Matt, an unexpected surprise, good to see you again, shopping spree
	Friday for both of us, huh?  ;)
Mook, good luck on your interview!  See you soon!
Lacie, who unfortunately was able to take a picture of the jedi in his natural
	habitat, thanx for comin out, have fun the rest of the day off...  Grrr...
Eric, thanx for sharing all those flyers and your wealth of information.  Get 
to work!  ;)

And since the weather is getting better and better, why don't we make this a
weekly thing.  Same bat time, same bat channel?  Like a floating lunch deal.
People can show up as they please, no hassle, worry free, and grub with
other sfravers of the South Bay flava!  Nice park, pretty close, a central 
location,
and plenty of parking, some shade and plenty of playground material.
I'll be there with my RotJ lunchbox!  =)

Your Jedi Bitch,
Jedi666Boy

ok just have to pipe in-
maybe its just me but seems the size and attitude of the police have
changed over
last few yrs.
it used to be 'alright you kids, poor those drinks out and get the hell
out of there, this is private property' etc.  and that was it.  it didnt
seem like
their *goal* was to make a bust, just to sorta keep things in order.  i
dont know
how many parties, campingtrips, nights out, etc., would have landed us all
in jail
if cops  had the attitude they do today.  the attitude used to be 'yeah i was
young once, i like to have fun too, you just cant do it HERE, or if I get
another complaint.., etc.
Now its like a contest or a hunt 'hey look here Mel, caught me real good one!'
there are still resonable cops, but in some cities, san jose for instance, i
dont know if they were over-funded or what, but there are simmply too many cops
and not enough crime to go around between them, so you end up with bored cops
looking for bust. and if you look different/wierd, forget it.  in sf ill
see someone
driving wrong way down 1way street at night with lights off and nothing happens.
in san jose, you double-park for 30sec while your friend grabs a tape for
you (this happened to me) and 3 cars swoop on the scene ready to arrest you.
'is this, uh your vehicle, are you sure??? ever been arrested?'  the best was
few weeks back, we were pulled over due to 'the illegal ornament hanging from
rear-view mirror'.  it was a plaque.  i got full drunk test + breathalizer
and passed,
yet they still didnt want me to drive the remaining 3 blocks to my house.
yikes...

Booyah motherfuckah!!!! 

Matt just put it right on target.  When I first heard them on that
glorious radio station       LIVE 105......j/k.....I totally thought it
was a Chemical Brother's track. Nope, it was just another average techno
group that was jumping on the Chemical Brother bandwagon at the time.  I
listened to more and more of the tracks from that point and have to say
it's not necessarily worth the attention they're receiving.  Maybe it's
the name.  You know how mainstream society likes groups that affiliate
their names with something bad and corrupt in their own eyes.  I mean,
mainstream society obviously isn't for the use of crystal meth, but in
their good hypocrytic fashion, they want to embalm themselves in
something that they are against already.  

I don't know.  Don't mind cynical ol' me.

Fact: Its "The Crystal Method" not jes "Crystal Method" and it has
nuttin to do about the drug, it has to do about this female bus/truck
driver they met awhile back who had this odd way of doin somethin and
she called it "The Crystal Method", and thats how the 2 artist got their
name. They thought it was funny that it sounds a whole lot like Crystal
Meth.
Another Fact: TCM are great artists, and has their own sound. 
thats whats i think anyhow.

Besides everyone should respect Tekno artists who makes the beatz we
rave to and oh so love!
and thats TCM!
and thats the Chemical Brothers!

Hey, I was there!  I thought TCM was awefully generic,
though.  Fatboy Slim was loads better.

Just my 1/50th of a dollar.

RE-PLY:

Nope. The group got their name from a Hip Hop artist who talking 'bout
"crystal method" in a track or something that they were producing when they
owned/ran a production studio.

I know this because we interviewed them for Citi:Zen....

Small fact, but still fact...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the Question:

Can millions of people, focusing their minds on inner and world peace,
heal the world in an instant?

Can we, through scientific and quantifiable means, prove that we are
indeed the creators of the world we perceive, and that by changing our
perception, the world itself changes?


             This is "The Great Experiment."


It's time we prove scientifically what the saints and sages have
always told us- that we are powerful spiritual beings with the ability
to create a world based on the laws of love, instead of the rules of
fear. 

Two months ago, James Twyman, author of the bestselling book,
"Emissary of Light," was invited by the government of Iraq to perform
his "Peace concert" in Baghdad. The situation seemed desparate war
seemed almost inevitable and diplomatic efforts seemed to have failed.

"I was being used by the Iraqi government," Twyman said. "But we had
the same goal: to avoid this terrible war. I was given permission to
sing the Muslim prayer for peace to Saddam Hussein and I wanted the
world to join us in this prayer. Hundreds of thousands of people over
the world participated, and when it was complete, I felt a profound
shift in the energy of that whole region. Three days later, a peace
agreement was signed, something which seemed impossible before the
prayer vigil began."


             But The Story Continues . . .


"A week later, I was invited by the government of Northern Ireland to
sing at Stormout Castle in Belfast - the building where the peace talks
were being held. For days, bombs were exploding all around that area.
Many people were trying to interrupt the peace process and it seemed
like the talks might fall apart. Once again, thousands around the
world joined us in prayer, and three days later there was a
breakthrough in the talks. April 12, 1998, a peace accord was reached.

The evidence is there - we do have the power within us to change the
world. Scientists have measured the statistically significant effect
that focused meditations and events have upon the earth's energy
field. These effects were measured during the GaiaMind Meditation and
during Princess Diana's funeral. The studies show that the greatest
effects occur when groups synchronize their focus. During "The Great
Experiment," we will meditate upon specific affirmations in unison to
achieve the power of a singular group focus.

                 NOW IT IS TIME TO PUT INTO PRACTICE 
                   WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW TO BE TRUE:

"If enough people join their minds and hearts for peace, we can heal
the world."

"The Great Experiment" will take place on April 23rd at 6:30 PM
Eastern Daylight Savings Time ( This would be 10:30 PM GMT ) Please
mark your calendars now, and tell everyone that you know to join with
us.

James Twyman has been invited to sing the peace prayers from the
twelve major religions at the United Nations building in New York on
April 23rd. This presents an unparalleled opportunity for us all. Dr.
Doreen Virtue, best-selling author of The Lightworker's Way, and Gregg
Braden, geologist and author of Awakening to Zero Point and Walking
Between the Worlds, join James in conducting this incredible
experiment. Authors, entertainers, and other celebrities, will
participate by sharing their vision of "a world transformed by love."

Here's how you can participate:

1. Tell everyone you know. Share this with everyone on your mailing
list so that everyone can participate. Feel free to print this out and
make copies. The goal is to get as many people as possible focused on
this meditation.

2. Begin preparing your spirit and mind for the event by spending a
few moments in silence everyday. This will help build the energy.

3. Join at least one other person for the vigil on April 23rd. This is
an experience to share. "Where two or more are gathered."

The Format of the Meditation:

1. Opening:

Begin with this affirmation, said with great power and committment:

     I am an Emissary of Light. I extend this Light to all beings, in
compassion and love, knowing that they are one within me. this
moment the world is healed - and I along with it. I will it - and
it is so.

2. Then spend five minutes creating a sound (such as "Om") to carry
the spiritual energy and vibration. This can be done with a single
tone or by singing a song such as "Amazing Grace."

3. Spend five minutes in silence allowing your spirit to receive the
light and love which you yourself extended to the world.

4. End with this prayer:

     "It is done! I am one with all - and all is healed. Let love
reign where fear once was. I accept this for myself and for the
world. I am an Emissary of Light now and always. Amen"

Then, with reverence, bow your head and thank God for this grand
opportunity. The universe gives thanks to you for being part of this
great experiment.

I'm starting a new job (contract) in Sausalito on Friday, and I'd be
really psyched to get a ride to Minh's. I won't be able to go until 5 or
so, but Sausalito's right on the way to San Rafael. if you can give me
a ride, let me know -- I'll be super grateful. :-)

Yeah... Nuke Them Damn Spamming Hippies Tabitha!!!!

Everyday should be peace day folks... do we really need to go "Ohm" 
together to understand that the world might be a better place without
weapons of mass destruction?  Let's put it this way... we live in a
country that has tons of nasty weapons and two political parties...
violent Republicans and violent Democrats (and don't forget about all
those Police actions to "insure peace" we're involved in...).

If we all took five minutes to write a letter to a politician rather than
do a chant, or make up with a long term enemy that you swear you'd
punch if you saw, maybe it would get more done?

Peace,
AndyW

I also think just doing something simple that you are capable of without
question is a start.  I go to the beach often and everytime I go,  I
pick up at least ten pieces of trash before leaving.  Or wherever I
happen to enjoy the outdoors.  I'm not preaching, just passing on a
suggestion given to me.  Do what you can and just spread the vibe.
Goodness travels in waves, and we all know waves travel to produce
goodness.  I'm out...peace be with you...

aloha,
moki

It's getting springy boyz and grrlz.... time to get *SpRInGY*... time for
the xtra special loving and snuggling during the warm and cozy nights of
passion in the days, nights, evenings, mornings to come...(and everything
in*between)...   @;')~  hrrmmm...

and lets it be known that my hair is in the *in*between*stage*... extra
curly and lucious the way you all love it! (=@!... smirk...

Going to Grandma's house today for my weekly visit... I love her...
grandparents are so important.... we can learn so much from them and they
can learn so much from us.... I love the way I make her smile... and the
way she makes me smile.... --->> =)*(=

I am not wired on coffee at work... I am groovin' by stuff at work
listening to Q-Burns from the Winter Music Conference in Miami... GOD!...
aaaaah.... soooo sweet it is... =) =) =)

Religion, Sir?
HOUSE!

See, spams make you smile... at magical, mystical, sick and twisted life
forms like me!

And if you're annoyed you have no reason to be. Because this is all
good vibes... no negativity.... maybe a couple kbits of extra data across
some routers... but what's it really about? Increasing the warmth.... and
I feel I've done that with this post.. unles you're a cranky spazz and
don't know how to be happy.... but to know how not to be happy is to know
how to be happy, because you're so good at strategic planning to
counter act good vibes... making yourself upset... (= Be happy.... *you
deserve it*...and if you're not happy, relax and sift through the things
that are making you upset... and think of each one... as they cannot be
anything worth making you that upset... because you're here... and there
are still people who care about you..... see.. I don't have to post
this... but I want to... and feel good doing it. Otherwise I'd e-mail
myself...  and that would be scary.... :)

Have a great Wednesday.

ok i'm in a predicament...i have this math problem i need to solve for 
extra credit..and i need the extra credit, ya know what i mean?
so here it is..

How many seven digit numbers using only the digits 1 through 9 in 
which exactly two digits are alike are there?

this means that 0 is not a digit.  
and ONLY two digits can be the same, every other digit must be 
distinct.

um..email me personally if you have it mastered, or if you have any 
suggestions on how to solve it.  oh yeah, here's one hint: the answer 
is over 10,000.  thats all i know.
thanks in advance :)

-*-Written today during my day at work... looking out into the deep blue..
with the white fluffies tickling the skyline...  thinking of you guys-*-

See of Think

I glide through the think plane infinitely in my own liking
Distant citadels and sky beams interact to create spectrums into the 
point of infinence above distant astral lands
Around me is that which I choose
I swim freely as I once had in a different time and place, a different
setting entirely, one of water and collective harmonix, yet it is all the 
same
Metaphors and paradyms sweep through me and bring a smile to my lips, 
spinning forever off the lips of others as reflections of love
My eyes close as I spin in every direction expanding the energy within        
Life forms are around me enjoying my expressions, feeling more comfortable
expressing their own, as we are no longer alone, and never have been
Moments like this remind us of this, and make us forget the invisible
shackles that we create for ourselves
Doubt is non-existent and progressive thought fills the vast expanse   
of spectracreaminess as we all become one, once more, in our own choosing  
The universal tourist faked into believing this self-sustained reality
that is the material world, is set free and returned to a view point that
is much more familiar 
The warm seat of consciousness is fitting to you in every way from your   
nosey nose to your tosey toes                               
Casio and rolex are out of business as time dissipates and pure emotion   
emerges and flows from the meridian banks
This is the gift to ourselves from ourselves for ourselves  
It's just a matter of time until that secret santa climbs up your chimney 
and you receive the greatest gift of all; life unrestrained and unrefined 
Ride the waves and swim underneath them, deep within in them, to the
depths of love and joy
For this is all within you, me, them, in *us*
We simply have to remember and allow ourselves this great gift of life

Don't question what life is, know what life is
Questions are for those who require the answers of others,
to replace their own answers that are overshadowed by self-created doubt.
So who is making the answers? 
I believe it is those who believe in and follow their heart. 
If it is warm and fuzzy it cannot be wrong. 
As this is our direct link to the greatness we are bound to and ultimately
apart of. 

Swim deep and play nice with the other fish in the see.

-me

7pm:  300 or so people gathered at the pier looking like a low grade bad
dream hipster hallucination to the random lost tourist wandering by.....
The vibe is already grand and promising and we haven't even left the dock
yet.  Took off around 8pm just as the sun dipped behind the GG headlands to
whistles, applause, cheers...cruised under bridges, around islands, Alcatraz
taken over by gulls, water tranquil and air warm in the Bay's inner reaches,
the water rough and the boat is shaking, tippy as we head to the GG bridge,
disoriented it's hard to tell what's really tipping, the dancefloor just
cheers and goes with it, it's just another motion another rhythm another
beat the cheerful tippiness.....sparkling views of the SF skyline, phat
laser light show projected unto unknown dark islands as screens,....two
dance floors packed the whole night........the music  downtempo hip-hop
shades into driving jungle as the night wears on upstairs...while downstairs
started with pounding progressive house....shading into funky slower-tempo
house as the night ended.  what an unbelievably beautiful party and night.
Completely memorable.

so I want to start transfering my computer graphics onto video
so that they can be played at partys. I am wondering
if anyone has any suggestions as to what the best interface
is to do this. 

Also is anyone would like to join in some multimedia projects with me
let me know. If you are a musician, dj, painter, computer
artist or anyone else that would like to join me for some
interesting and fun projects let me know.

just fire up that amiga and you got smooth sailing visuals running
criss-cross sidewinder MY GOD IT'S FULL OF STARS and it sure looks purty.
actually i think  maybe you don't even need an amiga anymore, perhaps in
this enlightened age someone has found the magical way to interface a TV
with more than one brand of computer.  so yeah, Video Toaster.  yay

by the way i want to work with you on this.  i have some ideas that are so

      If anybody knows anything about who I should contact to get
involved please let me know. I have left voice messages and recieved no
reply. I am not looking for any compensation.  I just want to be a part
of a crew that knows what raving is all about. Every person that has
griped about the rave scene hasnt been to a Harmony or Vibration party.
I really want to be a part of that. Please respond if you can help me
out. Or should I say if I can help you out.


   Love to everyone,

Oh, no problem. It's just a small thing, really.

However, Fatboy Slim, eh? Their live shows may be great, but, man, I do not
dig their sound...

It's very commercial and not very interesting. Guitars over looping
breakbeats...They sound real predictable to me.

Underworld, however, knows how to tear it up on wax, but their live shows blow.

I think orbital and prodigy would make a great tour team. A little bit of
cheese and energy, with supurb music...

I've seen them both and enjoyed them immensely for different reasons..

;)

Did you know the 86.5% of all statistics are made up? Really, all one can
do is guess. Zoning takes out much of that guesswork.

And without a standard set of applicable laws, decisions would likely be

Please, don't attempt to put words in my mouth. What I stated is that when
a person moves in to a dwelling is that they have the right (legally and
"morally") to receive "quiet enjoyment" of that property. 

If there is blame to be laid it is with the person(s) making the zoning
decisions. 

What I find in the attitude expressed by you and others is myopia. It is
the inherient inability to see things from any other perspective but your
own. It is what leads to the constant "us vs. them" syndrome that so much
of this society enjoys.

Do you live right next to a club? Could you at all entertain the
possibility that hearing that thud-thud-thud night after night after night
might begin to bother you after a while?

Please. As a person that enjoys music, and has gone to a couple of clubs
in my life time, if I had to make a decision as to which was more
important me shaking my ass at 3 a.m. or the ability for someone to sleep
so they can get up and live their life, I would side with the person
needing sleep.

No. And being to give a yes and no answer is the crux of the issue. Common
ground must be found for there to be hope of everyone being happy....

Okay, I get opinionated about this stuff... here goes.

Eh... I take it you missed Organic, the first year when they had Orbital,
Underworld, Loop Guru (I thinks... I kinda lost some of the evening),
Chemical Brothers, Electric Skychurch, Orb...

Underworld kicked some serious ass in the live department there... hopping
around, playing perfect stuff for their time slot... as did Electric
Skychurch with their early daytime performance, and Orb with a set that
had me pass out two or three times from dancing too hard at altitude (it
WAS at a ski resort at a fairly good altitude, but I was feeling a tad
elevated in my own right). 

As for Crystal Method... I don't care how they claim they got their name,
that's a strike against them in my book.  They play from the same formula
as the more recent Prodigy and Chemical Bros which is a sound that's just
plain going flat to my ears (I call it macho breaks)... I also saw them
live, and to be honest, they sucked compared to the other acts at the
Warfield that night.  I really hate it when you see them playing a certain
part on the keys and then they stop playing it and the part keeps going... 
why bother? The CM were all about a light show... and my final pet peeve,
everytime the music peaked, like 2000 dataflashes went off in everybody's
face (strobes when overused are ugly painful).  Sounded like a lot of
breakbeat cliches sequenced together.

Fatboy Slim does deserve props as well as Propellerheads (and who was that
other guy who spun bigbeat stuff?) for delivering solid big beat with a
lot of class that night... not too big a fan of the genre and the magazine
hype surrounding it, but those guys had talent at least (and you can tell
they were actually playing, fixing mixes, having fun, a pleasure to watch
and listen to really). The Crystal Method were the headliners and I guess
it's all a matter of taste, but I think any other act on the bill at that
show deserved it more... the other acts seemed to pack more style,
creativity, personality and talent.

I think I just pissed off half the list...

I actually have a couple of old amigas and tons of amiga software stuffed in my closet.
They were truely great machines back in tht late 80's. Anyone that can use any old amiga
software let me know...besides high level graphics i have some midi,sequencing, and
sound programing software also.

I never got the toaster but did put some stuff on video with the amigas but
none of that is compatable with pc.

I think all that are interested in this too can come over and have some
of my homemade french bread vegie pizza, put on some cd's and talk 
about our ideas. If we could do that out in the forest around the campfire
that would be all the better...although i dont know if i can make pizza
on a campfire...

I'm down. I live very close to berkeley, so I'll definitly be there. 
Defending our right to dance is a great idea, and I'm there. Just let me 
know where to meet, or if you need help with organization, let me know. 
Just put 'dave' in the subject heading at the beginning so I know it's 
directly to me.

Peace and Love,
Dave

I really have to disagree here.  =)  When I was in England a little over a
year ago, I got to see Underworld perform twice. And let me tell you,
those were two of the most energy packed performances I have seen in my
life. Of course, maybe it had something to do with the crowds. One show
was at the Redding Festival, in the 'other' tent with everyone cramed
together... lights swirling, people jumping up and down... the securty
gaurds throwing water at the crowd to keep 'em cool. I got to see them
again at a Universe party. Image a HUGE tent that appeared to be bigger
than the inside of the Richmond Civic center. With at least 5,000+!
people. Talk about a spiritual feeling. Sooo many people gettin' down to
the music. Especially that Rez/Cowgirl mix they do, and Born Slippy which
seemed to be the anthem of the summer.... mmmmmmmmmmmmmm....

I also got to see Darren Emerson spin some vinyl at Mr. C's club, and
wasn't particularly impressed. I was really looking forward to hearing
him play out, but the music he played was kind of boring... Oh well...

Of course, we are all entitled to our own opinions...  =)

   I'm downfor the veggie pizza! Whenever there is food involved, I'm 
there. Especially homemade. I love to cook, so maybe I can help. 
   But back to the subject, I would really like to learn about visuals. 
I got some friends who are really into it too, but we need to find some 
equipment. Just yesterday they were drilling me about finding a 
switcher/mixer. So let me know when you guys want to meet. Weekends are 
good for me, or the week too, but I'll soon have a regular job so that 
won't hold.
   Give me a call @ (510)547-0969

Peace and Love,
Dave

Note: This message was originally posted to nw-raves.  I'm from Seattle, and
have heard about the Goa Vibe Crew and the boys from Sixth Sense through the
grapevine.  I finally mustered the free time to go down and was NOT
disappointed.

Also, DJ Meri, I think I'm in love with you.  Got your tape from Prem and
Ray, and
my tape deck in my car bites my hand every time I try to eject it!!!!

---------------------------------------------------------

"Trance is at the pinnacle of modern electronic music.  Its rhythms so
hypnotic and driving that I have seen people climb into a speaker baffle in
an attempt to become one with the music."

You know, I had always heard that the Israeli goa was the shit, but before
now, I had no idea.  Allow me to recap...

I, my beautiful darling Karen, and Carlo, (the original dawn panic
guerrilla) arrived at LAX on a warm Friday night.  Karen, having never
visited LA, was immediately consumed by its vastness.  My recollections were
vague, having lived there over 10 years ago.  Because of the heavy rains,
the city had received a rare boost, and the vegetation was growing wild,
flowers blossoming from every nook and cranny.  Even the freeways were
bedecked with pink and white, rare dessert flowers claiming supremacy over
the concrete and dust.

We chilled at the Cat and Fiddle, enjoying a few beers and the freedom to
smoke at one of the few remaining bars in LA to provide refuge.  LA has
banned smoking, even in bars, but the Cat and Fiddle's main area is an open
air courtyard.  Underneath the propane lamps and 10 foot fica trees we
finally relaxed from our flight.

The next day, we went shopping.  As the rains had tormented the city for
weeks, the first break of sun brought out people by the millions.  Rodeo
Drive, Vermont, and Melrose were filled with throngs of beautiful people,
the fashions were raw and refined, and groover chic was KING.  The most
interesting stuff I've seen in a long time.

Then, around 11:00, we headed off to the Spanish Kitchen Studios, a suite of
sound stages that were usually used for filming, and were designed for
acoustic perfection.  The main room housed around 250 people perfectly, and
was driven by an impressive sound system.  The back chill room was an open
air courtyard, with one brick wall covered by blooming wisteria and a
flowering tree of some kind -- enormous big red blossoms.

The chill room was delicious, a spiritual refuge, where ambient DJs soothed
the weary groover with sounds of whales and nature, a little slow trance,
and even some Cocteau Twins (Victoria Land).  The main room, however, was
madness...

After peaking, I rambled into the main room, and was immediately charmed by
the most incredible flouro garb I had ever seen, groovers galloping around
like stallions around a may-pole, bright psyche-patterns blurring with
glowing eyes and bright smiles.  The music was twisted, with DJ Kavandi and
his ten
year old son, DJ Christ taking the crowd for a journey.

Then Amnon took over around 12:00 and didn't let up until 4:00.  Amnon, my
friends is from Israel, and had the most incredible shit I have ever heard.
You can't find what he has in ANY record store.  His collection was all on
CD, and he crafted his magic with a dual CD player with pitch control.  Yes,
say what you will about the touch and feel of vinyl.  But, remember, the
important thing here is the music.   His bytes were hot off the synthesizer.
Psychic Deli and others have made special mixes for the masterful Amnon, and
he bore down on the crowd with such ferocity as to make grown men whimper
for mercy.  I looked at his set list, and it was all written in Hebrew.  I
asked him if he could translate the list for my own copy, so I could at
least drop the titles to my good buds in Seattle, and he simply shook his
head and smiled like a gargoyle, perched atop his magic box.

These Israelis were unstoppable, galloping around the dance floor, whipping
the crowd to a level of hypnosis I've never seen before.

I realized that there was there was only one thing to do.  I'm going to
bring them here to Seattle, and I'm going to promote a few shows this
summer.  I'll announce the dates and locations once I have that ironed out.
Seattle must know this kind of passion.

Also, I found out that Tsuyoshi is coming to the states and will be doing a
gig in the coming months.  The date has been confirmed, but I don't have the
info here.  I'll announce that as soon as I get the information.

Love,

Julian Klappenbach

yeah, i was walking to the bathroom by the Organ Pavilian in Golden Gate
Park last Saturday when i stumbled across that free out-of-sight party.
high noon, a park full of bass, and not a soul on the dance floor. you
gotta love this city. 

GGP parties have been pretty spontanious as of late. the last one that i
remember was the Jeno & DJDan Organic that was on the same day as the Last
Sunset of '97 ((as if people in this city aren't spoiled enough they had
to choose between 2 free parties on the same day))and this one was thrown
together just the night before. no flyers, not on the calender, no posts
on SFraves, just a number. 437-4462.

i love outdoor parties, that's the future right there. people are cool to
me in clubs and all, but it's just something about the structure of walls
and sofas that can make it socially exceptable for these player guys to
plant thier shoulders in your face and zone out. with outdoor parties it's
just you, your space, and what you're able to do with it. it takes a
pretty bold dance to survive in broad daylight without any strobes or
lasers to hind behind. this is where i get a lot of my inspiration from.

a good number of raver superheros showed up. i think that if you were to
strip it down, the san fransisco scene really only consists of about 47
people. at any given time about half of them are on active duty, the rest
being semi-retired, or working on a real life, real girlfriend, or just
growing up.   

Work parties *hard*. it's gotten to be that i see that guy like 4 times a
week. 1015 on a wendsday: there's Work. kiddie rave on a saturday :
there's Work. spun out at sunset : there's Work. taking the 71 home on
Monday afternoon : there's Work, walking his dog on lower Haight. that
guy's like an ambasador of good karma. 

so yeah, Mr. San Diego, Mark E Quark, rocked the park on saturday, and the
free arter party at the Food Not Bombs 30 Minna flat with the Chocale
factory people was fun too. Soupstock should be interesting this saturday,
I don't see myself rocking out as much with that crowd, but it's worth
taking in. check it out,  i just got word that The Man is gonna be erected
in front of city hall for a week or so some time in July before being
hauled out to Black Rock. That should be pretty fucking surrreal. crazy
town -

sorry i wasn't trying to slam crystal method. i was only saying that i 
thought that their sound was similar to the chemical brothers and 
because of that they shouldn't be hailed as the best american electronic 
act... also i gotta say that i don't believe that story about how they 
got their name... i think thats just so the mainstream media wont mess 
with them...if you ask me its a full on drug reference...
written with the most respect in mind...

We kick off our hosting of crews at Eklektic, beginning with the Jungle Love
crew.

We have Honey B and DJ Sifu both accompanied by Butterfly and opening up is
our beloved resident Stareyes.  

The Eklektic specs:
thursday's
kate o'briens
$5    21+
415.332.5800 X 247

There was plenty of room for dancing last week in case anyone was curious.
I know some of the SF locals have been a bit bummed because there has been
no room to move at the club, last week the capacity was at a perfect
capacity level and I hope to see you down at Eklektic tonight for a special
dancing experience and a warm wonderful vibe.  


Upcoming 2 weeks:
4/30    Phunckateck Boyz (Jason Mouse, UFO!, Noel and Abstract)
5/07    Home Invasion (R.A.W./Oscar da' Grouch), Sponsored my N20
Entertainment, GRIP, Giant Robot Magazine and Ground Score.

No time to kick out the SF knowledge other than this blatant self promotion,
too much to do too little time.  
Comming soon: Ground Score newsletter printed weekly.  Not only will all of
you on the computer get the SF info on the hapnins in the music industry,
but so will those who keep their ears close to the streets.

One mention:  D I G I T A L ,  Wednesday nights, it's almost here, May 6th
with Goldie.  Sponsored by FTT and Phunckateck, they are going to go nutty
with this showcase!

	[Moki]  Hell yeah!  I was so dead from dancing the night before
(Fri.) then hitting the End Up until 11:30 a.m. on Sat.  Then I went
home to change and nap before the GGP party outdoors (that shit was off
the hook)...go see dj Buck if you get a chance, too funky no to
dance...I was dead tired but Sat. night at the Yoga Center on Minna St.
with the Chocolate Factory was was too sick...I was chillin' during most
of the sets until Frankie Ride came on and slammed me with his groovy
trax...next thing ya know I'm up front screamin' at him to, "FUCK IT UP
FRANKIE!!!"...those boys are hella cool...we chilled the rest of the
night and saw them on the boat cruise too...Sameer and Joeski are really
good people...all of them care about the vibe and are down to earth...I
think Joeski is booked for the next Sunshine Daydream party on May
16th...I was so tired but well worth it...anyone else go?...I'm
out...peace be with you...

Robert Pointer sez (about Fatboy Slim):
>It's very commercial and not very interesting. Guitars over looping
>breakbeats...They sound real predictable to me.

I _love_ Fatboy Slim--and his music does seem pretty mainstream but actually
it's not.  I say that because I don't think most (I repeat most) mainstream
people get it.  Like I when I went to The Rage one night and the dj played
"Song for Lindy," no one really knew what to do.  They were all waiting for
that ChumbaWumba remix to come on.

What I'm saying is that he's no Armand Van Helden or Daft Punk and therefore
the only people who think he's mainstream are people who use words like
"mainstream" and "commercial."  Like us!

And is commercial music necessarily bad music?  Am I not allowed to like the
Chemical Brothers anymore?  And hey, "Little Fluffly Clouds" (The Orb) was
on a VW Bug commercial--does that mean it sucks too?

I'm not necessarily dissin Robert (no way man), but I'm calling into
question the use of the word "commercial" as a negative adjective.

>Underworld, however, knows how to tear it up on wax, but their live shows
blow.
This is just my opinion, but most live tekno shows blow.  Everyone's looking
at the stage like their @ a rock concert and all you see is somebody running
around twisting knobs and pressing buttons.  It sucks.  People should treat
a live act like a dj--look at the visuals, not the stage.

The other problem with live shows is that you don't get the variety in
music/sound etc. that you get from a dj.  A DJ plays a bunch of records by
different artists w/ different sounds & styles during his/her set, but w/
live acts you have only one sound, one style.  Bleah.

An example of a live act that wasn't much to watch or listen to:  The
Crystal Method.

The only live acts that are ever entertaining are musicians who are also
djs, and spin their music and other people's too--musicians like the
Chemical Brothers and, hey, Fatboy Slim.  I guess the only exception to this
rule that I've seen is Moby--oops, I got the words "asinine" & "ridiculous"
mixed up with "entertaining."

xoxo--Miccaela

Often times they will just flash their lights and talk over their PA
and not even get out of their car.  Often times they will ticket
all cars parked near the party.  In rare cases they will start
towing the cars.

unlikely.

>   arrest you & confiscate equipment?

arresting you is very unlikely.  Confiscating equipment is unlikely, but
it has happened.  It depends on where you are.  If you have broken
into private property, or doing something *very* illegal, they might
confisacte equipment.  If you are just out on some random, public beach,
its is unlikely they will arrest you or confiscate equipment.  Its
all a matter of how illegal your party is.

keep a dozen around just in case.... and coffee.  I know from expereince
that park rangers like chai...

> anyone have any horror stories?  how recently?

I was involved with "oystergate"... a party near the oakland airport
that got busted and all 40 or so people got slapped with a 250 dollar
fine.  We collectively got a lawer... who managed to reduce our tickets
to 50 dollars each, plus 50 dollars each to pay for the lawer.  This
was several years ago.

I just heard (or, actually, just remembered hearing) that
the official name that Intel uses for it's Pentium logo
(picture it in your head, now) is the "Drop E Logo".

No wonder they're so fast!

Cheer up!
Steve.

   It's another huge weekend coming up...  Last night I stopped by at
   the Top for the Vinyl Treetment, the beats and the crowd were
   totally fonky.  Any good weekly that's within walking distance from
   my house is enough to make me a regular!

   I like Crewsade for tomorrow, and Bohemian Lounge; Trance Force 
   of course if you want trance, and Magic + its afterparty has
   a great lineup.  Saturday has too much goin' on to sort out, but
   check out Soupstock in the afternoon. 

   I was in a good mood this week and unsubscribed a couple of people
   who sent me mail asking for that, but usually I ignore those 
   messages since the instructions for unsubscribing are at the bottom...

hehehehe well last summer ian and meeks and i (under the name *grumpy
kidz*) tried to throw an outdoor evening/night jungle gig... 
	it woulda went OFFFFFFFFF had everything gone fine, people couldnt
even hear/see us, we were soo far back..
	but some fucked up arsonist decided to fuck with the area
and set a dock on fire..

we had no choice but to call the fire dept, scared we'd be blamed for it
if they just happened to stumble upon it themselves..

the lazyass cops didnt wanna walk the halfmile/mile wer had set up far
awy, so they waitd til one of us went up there.. alex and i had taken a
nap and when he tried to get back to the party, a cop was siitting around
all the parked cars and told us we couldnt go in.. turns out the first cop
was a little nice about it, tellin us to get the hell out..
	so i run off to find another location, there was an outdoor
detroit tecchno gig going on down the street and i was gonna ask em if we
could share the space, if the sound didn't interfere with one another. 
	when i come back, our sound system's still down in the area, coz
our friend's truck is down there, and these cops are tellin ian and alex
that if we don't get off the property they'll take our sound system and
have us arrested, and if we're found throwing a party around that area
that night we'd be busted HARDCORE.. they were totally harassing ian and
alex, to the point that we decided it was safest to just call it quits and
go home for the night :( the second group of cops were total DICKHEADS and
were makin fun of us, the way we talked and shit.. whatever! so...
	i've known people who've thrown parties outdoors and had their
entire equipment taken away, i've known people who just get warnings, i've
been to parties down in santa cruz when the cops just come, get bought off
and/or sweettalked, and they just turn their heads and drive off..

i guess it's all in luck, and how good you are at talking to cops ;)
xo
lara
p.s. looks like we're gonna be st00pid and try to throw a few more
all-jungle outdoor gigs so look out for my BSP's! :):) peace

Note: This message was originally posted to nw-raves.  I'm from Seattle, =
and
have heard about the Goa Vibe Crew and the boys from Sixth Sense through =
the
grapevine.  I finally mustered the free time to go down and was NOT
disappointed.

Also, DJ Meri, I think I'm in love with you.  Got your tape from Prem and
Ray, and
my tape deck in my car bites my hand every time I try to eject it!!!!

---------------------------------------------------------

"Trance is at the pinnacle of modern electronic music.  Its rhythms so
hypnotic and driving that I have seen people climb into a speaker baffle =
in
an attempt to become one with the music."

You know, I had always heard that the Israeli goa was the shit, but befor=
e
now, I had no idea.  Allow me to recap...

I, my beautiful darling Karen, and Carlo, (the original dawn panic
guerrilla) arrived at LAX on a warm Friday night.  Karen, having never
visited LA, was immediately consumed by its vastness.  My recollections w=
ere
vague, having lived there over 10 years ago.  Because of the heavy rains,
the city had received a rare boost, and the vegetation was growing wild,
flowers blossoming from every nook and cranny.  Even the freeways were
bedecked with pink and white, rare dessert flowers claiming supremacy ove=
r
the concrete and dust.

We chilled at the Cat and Fiddle, enjoying a few beers and the freedom to
smoke at one of the few remaining bars in LA to provide refuge.  LA has
banned smoking, even in bars, but the Cat and Fiddle's main area is an op=
en
air courtyard.  Underneath the propane lamps and 10 foot fica trees we
finally relaxed from our flight.

The next day, we went shopping.  As the rains had tormented the city for
weeks, the first break of sun brought out people by the millions.  Rodeo
Drive, Vermont, and Melrose were filled with throngs of beautiful people,
the fashions were raw and refined, and groover chic was KING.  The most
interesting stuff I've seen in a long time.

Then, around 11:00, we headed off to the Spanish Kitchen Studios, a suite=
 of
sound stages that were usually used for filming, and were designed for
acoustic perfection.  The main room housed around 250 people perfectly, a=
nd
was driven by an impressive sound system.  The back chill room was an ope=
n
air courtyard, with one brick wall covered by blooming wisteria and a
flowering tree of some kind -- enormous big red blossoms.

The chill room was delicious, a spiritual refuge, where ambient DJs sooth=
ed
the weary groover with sounds of whales and nature, a little slow trance,
and even some Cocteau Twins (Victoria Land).  The main room, however, was
madness...

After peaking, I rambled into the main room, and was immediately charmed =
by
the most incredible flouro garb I had ever seen, groovers galloping aroun=
d
like stallions around a may-pole, bright psyche-patterns blurring with
glowing eyes and bright smiles.  The music was twisted, with DJ Kavandi a=
nd
his ten
year old son, DJ Christ taking the crowd for a journey.

Then Amnon took over around 12:00 and didn't let up until 4:00.  Amnon, m=
y
friends is from Israel, and had the most incredible shit I have ever hear=
d.
You can't find what he has in ANY record store.  His collection was all o=
n
CD, and he crafted his magic with a dual CD player with pitch control.  Y=
es,
say what you will about the touch and feel of vinyl.  But, remember, the
important thing here is the music.   His bytes were hot off the synthesiz=
er.
Psychic Deli and others have made special mixes for the masterful Amnon, =
and
he bore down on the crowd with such ferocity as to make grown men whimper
for mercy.  I looked at his set list, and it was all written in Hebrew.  =
I
asked him if he could translate the list for my own copy, so I could at
least drop the titles to my good buds in Seattle, and he simply shook his
head and smiled like a gargoyle, perched atop his magic box.

These Israelis were unstoppable, galloping around the dance floor, whippi=
ng
the crowd to a level of hypnosis I've never seen before.

I realized that there was there was only one thing to do.  I'm going to
bring them here to Seattle, and I'm going to promote a few shows this
summer.  I'll announce the dates and locations once I have that ironed ou=
t.
Seattle must know this kind of passion.

Also, I found out that Tsuyoshi is coming to the states and will be doing=
 a
gig in the coming months.  The date has been confirmed, but I don't have =
the
info here.  I'll announce that as soon as I get the information.

Love,

Julian Klappenbach

We actually haven't thrown the out-sight-friday night parties in a
while...it came up in a few discussions a while back.......but we tend to
stick to the name of By the People now. Before we were all throwing the
parties together but bow we've just been throwing the By the People
parties...but keep an eye out I think we got more coming up!

The out-a-sight friday nights were also my first parties. i totally
remember them, that's why I still go to them today, cause they give me the
good feeling of the old days........:)

Ah yes.  What a refreshing sight and treat for my ears!

I did see them actually.

The only suck is the fact that they only opened for the second show (Stereolab
at Great American Music Hall)

Hey all!

Does anyone either know how to fix monitors, or have a spare one they'd
like to sell/give away to someone who is sick of her monitor turning
purple and robbing her of green? :(

Well unfortunately that pretty much is an unfixable problem.. the color tube
is messed and you'll have to send it in for a replacement if you can........
I've had that problem but all the blue left my screen then eventually about
2-3 weeks later the monitor started dying and then about a week later it faded
to black never to come on again : ) Hopefully you can get a new one from the
peoples who made it.... Just speaking from experience here.... I had to call
NEC and ship them my broken monitor in and wait for a week for a refurbished
(sp.) one.... I went through computer withdrawls I tell ya : ) Well if I had a
spare monitor it would be at your house in a minute..... but just to warn
you...... if it's the same problem I had you only have about a month from when
it started tweaking to get a new one or you will have a pictureless
monitor.....

Good luck,
Drakonis

buy a ticket and take the train to El Cerrito del NOrte (Target) and
someone here can pick you up -- call 234-9038.

Subject: M&m's party directions 





-->Hello everybody...it's me again,

	Directions to mi casa are as follows: Take all alternate routes to
the 580 WEST...since many of you will be heading north from say berkeley
or oakland or from the peninsula, just go as if you were going to a sunset
at Pointe Molate.  You want to stay on the left two lanes to get to the
580-W heading towards SAN RAFAEL; there is construction at the 580/80
interchange so be careful not to miss it. You want to take the MARINA BAY
PARKWAY/ South 23rd street exit...they switch names, but the exit before
mine is Regatta Blvd so keep an eye out. You want to make a left from the
offramp, which will put you on Marina Bay Parkway.  You will pass three
signals (you will cross Railroad tracks...if there is a train you will
have to wait for it to pass; I know of no alternate route to my complex). 
When you see the sign "The Beach" slow down; MY COMPLEX IS "THE SHORES"
which is after "The Beach". Turn right into "The Shores" which will place
you onto SHORELINE COURT...make an immediate left.  Call me at 071 at the
box and I will buzz open the gate. The road will curve right and my apt.
is #62 on the second floor on the right hand side at the first curve. 
Apparently there are two #62's in proximity, but open your ears...you
should be able to hear the music. Park in any UNCOVERED parking space
available. It's not that complicated, but I don't want anyone to get lost.
My address is:

62 Shoreline Court
Richmond, CA 94804
(510) 234-9038


	The party will start at 3PM and there will be DJ's...not sure who
yet; it's open tables so SURPRISE! :) It's a mellow party but it will go
on rain or shine; if the BBQ gets flooded I have a fireplace and
marshmallows at your service :O


See you Friday!
:)
M&m


PS	In case you end up at a different #62, I have a green astroturf
doormat with a white plastic daisy on it :) Kitsch baby!

 Hola amigos and amigas, 
 
 Today (Friday) is the SFRLunch, Downtown Edition.  Have your mommy pack 
your bologna sandwhich into your metal "Disco" lunch box, and come join 
us.
 
Anyhoo, the location is Sydney Walton Square, which
is between Davis and Front at Jackson St.  Commonly, this park is also 
called MacArthur Park, as the MacArthur Park restaurant is on the 
corner.  It's a nice park, with a fountain in the middle.  Pick up the
foodstuff of your choice and meet at the fountain at 1:00.  There are 
several large square stones there on which to sit.  To help you find us, 
we've set up a sumo ring, where Boy George will be wrestling with George 
Michael (we posted his bail after his little *incident*).
 
There is a safeway deli as well as a health food sandwich store directly 
across the street-- due south-- of the park, and there is a Yank Sing 
takeout dim sum, Oishii takeout sushii, Uno's, World Wraps, all that 
shtuff-- in the walkable vicinity.
 
If you're still confused where this place is, go to
www.mapquest.com. Go to the MAPS section.  Type in 94111 in the zip code 
section, hit enter. Click on the button, 'center and zoom in', then 
click on the red star on the map.  You're smart, you'll figger it out.

All are welcome, especially contagious lepers. We'll see you there....if 
you don't come, we'll talk about you,giving you that annoying 'ears are 
burning' sensation.

ALSO!!:  It's liz's (emenon) 21st birthday today, so come say hi or let 
her buy you a drink-- she's legal now! ALSO!! Infamous SF DJ and animal 
porn peddler Joe Rice is rumored to be coming!  ALSO!! Listmaster Brian 
Behlendorff occasionally makes noise that he may come!  Will he show?  
Or is there even such a person?  Is BRIAN really just an acronym for 
Binomial Random Internet Activity Network, an IBM-sponsored 
supercomputer that runs the whole show, much like the wizard in the

Well if you can get a amplified music permit then everything is ok ,
unless laws are being broken
ie... alcohol/drug consumption, or not respecting peoples property
(parking,graffiti)
First they will ask you to turn off the music and go home.
If you don't they will FINE you and/or confiscate the equipment.

Hello, I am going to be in San Francisco from June 10-15. I am looking for
any good clubs or parties to check out during that time, and I am also
planning on bringing records out. I have something lined up for Wednesday
night at a club called Sabotage, but would love to find something during
the weekend. I spin techno/tech-house, and would play for next to nothing
just to get the chance to... Thanks!

PS: I am not subscribed to the list, please reply privately.

Uhhhh...

The police can never confiscate your gear. They can impound it...which
is a pain in the ass...but they have no legal right to keep it....When
this happens, the legal owner has to go down to the police station to
pick up their property....The funny side of this would be getting the
police to carry your gear off the beach for you, so that you could pick
it up from them later.

If anyone is worried about getting their gear impounded from an outdoor
party, then write up a rental receipt...thus guaranteeing that someone
will be able to re-claim their confiscated gear. It also is proof to the
police that the confiscated gear has something to do with a persons
livelihood. This forces the police to return the gear in a timely
mannner, as holding it would cause the renter to loose revenue.

Peace,

ES

Ummm...the police can do what ever the rich want then to do.
The tenderloin in sf got its name from the quite common practice
of taking your local police man to dinner and buying him 
a big juicy tenderloin stake in exchange for a 'little favor"

Case in point is the sherif being forced to shut down the cannibas club.
He wants to obey the law but dan lungren and other people with the
money refuse to allow the law or the will of the people to be enforced.

I was pretty skeptical about jungle club nights in SF, expecting cheesy lightweight drum n bass white suburban trash rubbish (a la LTJ Bukem/Goldie etc) so it was with great trepidation that I ended my techno only moratorium and me n the messiah hit Eklektic last night.
Walked in at midnight and the place was rammed with people, music was full on jump-up and techstep jungle through a sweet soundsystem and people were going for it bigstyle on the dancefloor. Completely wikked. Big up the Eklektic massive, Bo!
What was that track with the dog bark sample? Ace.
Thoroughly recommended night.
So I've now got Tuesdays at Static, Wed at Sabotage and now Thurs at Eklektic every week, there must be something to fill Monday nights and my week is complete. What's No TV like?

 Hola amigos and amigas, 
 
 Today (Friday) is the SFRLunch, Downtown Edition.  Have your mommy pack 
your bologna sandwhich into your metal "Disco" lunch box, and come join 
us.
 
Anyhoo, the location is Sydney Walton Square, which
is between Davis and Front at Jackson St.  Commonly, this park is also 
called MacArthur Park, as the MacArthur Park restaurant is on the 
corner.  It's a nice park, with a fountain in the middle.  Pick up the
foodstuff of your choice and meet at the fountain at 1:00.  There are 
several large square stones there on which to sit.  To help you find us, 
we've set up a sumo ring, where Boy George will be wrestling with George 
Michael (we posted his bail after his little *incident*).
 
There is a safeway deli as well as a health food sandwich store directly 
across the street-- due south-- of the park, and there is a Yank Sing 
takeout dim sum, Oishii takeout sushii, Uno's, World Wraps, all that 
shtuff-- in the walkable vicinity.
 
If you're still confused where this place is, go to
www.mapquest.com. Go to the MAPS section.  Type in 94111 in the zip code

Hmmm... I wonder what LTJ and Goldie would think of your categorization of 
their music as cheesy lightweight drum n bass white suburban trash 
rubbish, especially since neither of them are white or suburban. Not to 
mention, both have made immense contributions to drum n bass... without 
them and the producers they have fostered and the scenes that they 
helped build, I doubt you would even know what jungle is.

show a little respect,

it's nice to see people are taking the next evolution. but i don't see
why it should be such a surprise to folks when they find themselves
thoroughly entertained at a night such as (and specifically) eklektic. i
would say that i haven't seen a single bad review of that party in the
many i've read... (though that wouldn't be exactly true, however if
memory serves the author promptly recanted after dina removed her boot
from his bum). 

the jungle scene in SF is alive, live and off the hook. i'm torn between
the impulse to tell everyone i know and not tell a sole so that i have
more dancin' room to myself. but either way, the shit is good. like i
said, c@weasle and mw, i'm glad y'all took a chance on a sure thing, but
damn, when will people stop saying shit like "you can't dance to drum
and bass?"

moving on; goldie & LTJ  = "cheesy lightweight drum n bass white
suburban trash rubbish" ? i'd say you're full of shit and you don't know
from what you speak of, but rather than incite a flame war, how about
you just check goldie @ digital in 2 weeks. see what you have to say
after that... 

i missed LTJ @ ultra last year, but i didn't hear anyone use the words
"cheesy lightweight drum n bass white suburban trash rubbish " then
either.  ;-)

see ya @ eklektic next week then,

jdw

I'm not going but if anybody likes really good breakbeat that's almost
trancy, they go to this to check out DJ Micro. This is supposed to be his CD
release party for his Micro-Tech-Mix from Moonshine records and this CD is
dope. His previous CD Coast to Coast is pretty good too but his new one is
outstanding and definitly worth checking out.

Preach it bruthah Radon!  You don't have to like it, any
more than I don't to like I-can't-beatmatch-so-I'll-
spin-techno (j/k).  But don't bag on innovaters like those
two.  Without them, we'd still be in the dark ages of house!
Sorry, it's Fry Day.

Next week is Phunkatek Boyz UFO!, Abstract, Noel, and
Jason Mouse!  I'll be the one with bells on!

Steve.

GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR...................

Don't talk trash about LTJ Bukem.... there are many of us who admire and
live our lives with a lot of love and empathy for his beautiful music.
I've met him personally and he's a very beautiful person, indeed.

And I was just about to e-mail you for a tape... as people have told me
that you're talented...

Had to do this...

GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR...................

Don't talk trash about LTJ Bukem.... there are many of us who admire and
live our lives with a lot of love and empathy for his beautiful music.
I've met him personally and he's a very beautiful person, indeed.

And I was just about to e-mail you for a tape... as people have told me
that you're talented...

Had to do this...

I'm not in any way the world's jungle expert - but I do know "cheezy
lightweight drum n bass" when I hear it, (maybe commercial coffee-table
jungle would be a better way to put it) and Goldie is it. Compare
anything he has produced to what you hear on London's pirates and you'll
see it immediately. If you don't live in london check out interface
pirate radio on the 'net - www.pirate-radio.co.uk - it's ace!

LTJ - havn't heard him in a while. His last tape that I have is from a
hardcore rave circa '92/93, and is brilliant. It's a shit recording, but
the music has soooo much energy and warmth, chopping and changing at an
amazing pace.

Pity I missed Eklektic - c u next week, looking forward to it.

	[Moki]  Hell yeah!  PirateRadio is the fuckin' ebola baby!  I
tune to them all the time.  Specially their jungle/d&b sets are just on
the edge.  They're definitely my fayv station on the net.  I got to hear
my boy Kayeed flow to some jungle last weekend on the boat cruise so I'm
lookin' for more hip-hop jungle.  Let me know if anyone has some mix
tapes.  betalounge.com has some pretty good mix sessions archived as
well.  Have fun...I'm out...peace be with you...

Well, thanks for all the lovely comments on the club.  We love making you
all happy, we do this drum n bass club for you all, not for our pocketbooks.  

So great having room to dance lately, agreed?  Sifu and Honey B fucked it up
last night!

One thing for all who dig d n' b to understand:  There is so much history
behind the music, there is a  much deeper meaning behind d n' b than most
think.  A lot of the junglists out there have only been turned on for 2
years or lass, this shit dates way back!  Think of reggae or ragga music,
how about Dub, the original Konkrete Jungle in Jamaica, the slums, and the
drums in the jungle, keeping the rhythm solid throughout the hellish living
conditions.  This is where jungle music came from:  Poverty, and opression.  

If you think someone is "lame" for being of a certain color or lifestyle, or
for having mixed a track on a soundtrack or for doing a sprite commercial,
just put it into perspective.  At least they are making paps ($) doing what
they like to do, diggin the vibe they dig and exposing a culture to thier
love of drum n bass (or whatever kind of) music.  On top of all that, these
artists that some slander as sellouts are simply "doing their job".  Any of
us in the music biz that have come from the underground or below ground and
now reside slightly above ground understand where Goldie and LTJ are coming
from, and it is time that those who are not involved in the biz, (perhaps
the listeners, purchasers, and clubbers) understand and educate themselves a
bit, as to not be slandering BIG NAMES out of ignorance.  

So again, I love the Eklektic reviews.  I am so glad the one gent is off the
techno only train and that he has found a love at Eklektic, but before
anyone SLAMS pioneers of a musical genre, pioneers that are so INTENSE,
please do your homework, figure your history out, etc.  If you had thought
of that I'll bet the words "white-trash" and Goldie and LTJ would not have
been in the same sentance.  (=
A much more appropriate thing to say woulod have been "Yeah - they are
played out - or yeah, they are superstars",. but RESPECT to them for all
they have done to pave the way for us to do what we pleasure doing, which is
diggin the drum and the bass.

Ciao and I look forward to seeing you ALL next Thursday for the Phunckateck
exhibition at Eklektic!

dmarie
Ground Score.

What exactly is Cheez??... lets think of this...

Cheese:

Free flowing, creamy, soothing, warm, fulfilling

like fluid... like human emotion....  

so what is BAD about CHEEZ?... nothing. It's good.. and people are afraid
to admit that we're all one and flow...     like cheeze... through
emotions...

I know there is music that lacks depth and lacks automatic reaction...
(soul tickling) ... but music that makes you feel *good* and is not
chaotic is not bad music.... it's simply a different style that you may
not like..

and like LTJ's Essential Mix tape (whatup Steve!) states... "Tell me one
guy that knows anything about music, just one guy.... no one knows
anything about music, *it's all a matter of opinion*".

It's Friday people.... it's going to be a fat weekend...

Happy kidz,
	I have been inspired to do whatever possible to influence all the
folks I care about (that's all y'all) to come experience the WHole Earth
Festival in Davis, California. Every year this cozy little town transforms
and comes to life creating, celebrating and sharing that powerful warm
vibe that we hold sacred in our underground dance scene. Solar powered,
rump-shakin grooves rangin from funky jazz to melodic trance to feed the
soul throughout the weekend, not to mention the FATTEST tribal drum
circles you';ll ever see. There's also grubbin ass organic food, hemp
goods and lotsa other goodies.
	 Most importantly, everybody there seems
connected. People toss friendly smiles left and right -- *just because*.
Worlds that we create like this, even if just for the weekend, are
important to our happiness and progress as human beings. So come and share
your own shining spirit with us at this gathering to celebrate and
appreciate our mother earth.
	Then when the smilin' sun sets, we'll continue our craziness into
the night at a good ol' Happy Kidz shindig up the road a piece. It'll be a
weekend getaway well worth the commute.
Love ya kidz! 
	(happykid marty wrote that, ain't he SWEET!)

I have listened to both LTJ Bukem and Goldie. I really could care less for
Goldie's Music, it just doesn't do anything for me. I'm not gonna say he sux
but it's just not music I like.
 However LTJ Bukem is amazing. It is very dancable or very chillable. I can
get down to it or totally relax to it. I just luv it.

thank you thank you thank you thank you! :)

i'm just posting a quick note here on my way out the door (a 2630 mile
drive i might add).  i just -needed- to thank sfraves for the absolutely
-amazing- time i had in califonia these past four months!  you guys are
the best!

i had a fantastic time, met some of the greatest people i've ever met in
my life, and went to some of the best parties i may ever go to: ever!
there are so many people i want.. no, NEED to thank right now, but i just
don't have time to do it!  don't worry, i'll be sending you all personal
messages to keep in touch--you'll just have to wait until i'm back in
toronto (around tuesday).

i got asked so many times for this the past week or two, so here it is, my
contact info! :) :

my email address is jason@slaughter.com, although this email addy
(jason@vfive.com) will still be active, i just won't check it as often.
my addy @actel.com WILL NOT work, so DON'T email me there! :)

my mailing address is:

59 hazelden grove
london, ON
N6H 5A1
CANADA

.. for all you kids who need to mail me stuff.  and catch me on irc in
#ice or #sfraves as 'isosceles' ...

oh yeah, and one more thing:  i know i said i'd talk to everybody
personally, i just -have- to publicize my hella thanks to GUYTROPIX!  this
guy is the nicest guy i've ever met!  he drove me -everywhere-, he
introduced me to -everybody- and on top of all that, he told me some great
stories :).. big props to GUY!  thanks, i owe you one bigtime! :)

anyhow, that's it, i've -really- got to get driving!  thanks again
everybody, I LOVE YOU GUYS!  for all you who didn't meet me, i was the kid
with the HUGE smile on my face every day! :)  drop me a line if you're
ever near toronto!

- jason :)

Hiya SFR folks!

Well I guess I'm back. Although I never really left at all, that 
addiction is begining to kreep back into my veins. Scary enough, I've 
even started buying records again! 

Anyway, for those of you who have tried to get in touch with me through 
thorfio@hotmail.com I'm truely sorry. When I started my new job in 
februaury my life became really chaotic and I was sooo busy and 
scattered that I hadn't checked my e-mail in like three weeks. When, I 
finally did, every computer that tried to upload the 1000 plus messages 
in my hotmail account got frozen dead in it's tracks. So I gave up and 
started this new one...so please, if you have anything important that 
you had e-mailed me over the last month could you send it to this 
address? I don't want to break any lose ties. And from now on I'm making 
it a point to check my e-mail every night, so I'll definately get 
anything you send me.

Anywayz...it was really aswome to see all of my old raver friends at the 
last two parties I was at...I definately miss you guys a lot. Hope to 
see yas soon.!

Stay Cool!

Matt

it would be nice to have magicians at raves. 
Long ago when you went to a spiritual temple there
was always a magician to remind us of the magic in life
and open our minds to the possibilities of magic.
All magic had a spiritual meaning like the cutting
of someone in half and putting them back together again
represented death and rebirth or reincarnation.

I know how to make ravers levitate, disappear, walk thru walls
escape chains, cut them into piece,etc, etc...
someday i would like to do a magic
show at a rave.

Big ups to the Eklektic crew!  I've been in SF since 15 January and I'm
returning to
Florida on 30 March; Eklektic has been a huge part of my week almost the
entire
time.  Thanks for one of the finest weeklies I've ever seen anywhere,
and massive
props to the sick ass mixophiles dropping riddim.

Well as you can see I am feelin good righ now. Drank some nice wine at
Minh's house earlier while spinin at Minh's house. I must say that
spinnin' music is a very adicting thing. When others wanted to take over
for "just a few tracks" I said sure but after one track I wanted to jump
back on again. I love it. I focused mainly on trance and Nick threw on
some housy stuff. I had a blast behind the tables tonight and I wanted to
thank everybody who showed up  as well as Nick and Minh for lettin' me
have a chance to play some tracks and enjoy the company. I love music and
I  love sharing it with other people. Take care y'all and don't get
yourself into too much troublr. ;P

everyone is entitled to their opinion, and to express themselves, but
please refrain from such vulgarity.
some of us *sheep* love and admire LTJ Bukem, for me he is a shaman.

btw i loved your set w/ Andy W at ((Vibe This)), your t~shirt was
hilarious it said "Fuck Goa Trance" although i luv Goa, i do have a
sense of humor ;)
you obviously do too, i just prefer to not make humor out of racial
issues, but who am i 100% *eurotrash* Spain/Czech baby! it's true that 
sometimes humor doesn't manifest too well on email posts...

I have now changed my email to "greg@harmonyproductions.com"

So if you need to mail me, please do it there, not the netcom addy. The
netcom addy will still exist, but it rarely works right, so please start
using the greg@harmonyproductions.com addy. Thanks!

Hey everyone!

I am posting to ask anyone that went to *Footprint* last night (the beach
party in Daly City) saw or knows about a little blue adidas bag that was
stolen last night.  
My friend Olivia had her camera with tons of special, sentimental pictures
along with her wallet with all her debit and credit cards and her ID as
well as other less important things...  So please, if anyone knows about
it, let me know.  Thanks, she and I would really appreciate it.

Hope everyone else had as good a time as I did at the Swadeshi' party on
Saturday.  My ride split at two right when the fuzz showed so I had to
leave early, but Thanks to Ken and Amy and everyone else involved.

I am hoping someone can enlighten me as to what "trance" is generally
associated with.  I had always thought of it as more ambient
sounding'ish but from the other day I seem to be mistaken.  I know I
have liked all the D&B I have ever heard.  Also are D&B and Jungle
equivelent nonclementure?  As I every hear them, they sound to be so.

cheers...

TRANCE is a 4/4 bass kick laid over a march.  all the different trance
subtypes just have different styles of melody lines.  the march element
(which also sounds like galloping horses) is the reason why it "entrances"
you--they use the same thing in basic training.  not that i'm about to turn
in my Aum Shivaya shirt and phat pants for a crisply pressed pair of olive
fatigues.

lotsa times people consider DRUMNBASS and JUNGLE to be identical but any
true junglist (wazzup lara) can tell you that drum n' bass focuses more on
intricate cut-up drum loops, hip-hop and such, whereas jungle goes more for
a stripped-down rhythm line and lets the growly analog-sounding synths do
the talking.  

preach on, my patch-cabled oscillatin' prophets, preach on.

I have a 50 gallon cybertroppix fishtank.... it's fishless but is for sale
I might *ad*.. $250 including all accessories, a nice black stand, and a
groovy guy to set it up.... ;)

I love fish.... they're very relaxing. As for eating the fish food... :)
well it depends on the fish you get... I had fish that I used to feed goldfish...
and I'm not too keen on munching on crunchy, slimy, goldfish.... as for
the flakes, well thats yet to be desired... and the blood worms... :/
well....   I'll stick to my tofu and rice..

I think the flaky fish food is a bunch of *stuff* pressend and packed...
kinda like our food...

'ello folx,
     Adam here (or Anakin to some of you...) just tryin' to let the 411
down on the hap's of last weekends' events.  Got the dirt on some and the
word on others...  So here's what I gathered.

FRIDAY:
     A majority of the evening was spent doing mappoint for _TranceForce_.
This event was sorta significant in many ways- it was in SF (mission
dist.), scheduled to go till daybreak, verymuchso on the UG tip
(bustability factor was up there), oh yeah, I was supposed to spin there
too.
     Mappoints can be fun, and they can also D.R..A...G....  (for a looong
time).   Fourtunatlly Friday was the former.  After many mappiont
misadventures (those stories could be a email initself) the point closed,
and off to _Trance Force_.


The location itself wasn't new, however, it's been so long since I've been
there last (oh, about 2 yrs. ago) it felt like raving in a virgin space.
The sound was nice, the vibes were flowing on the positive side and DRC was
stirring things up when I got there.  A good people count of about 300+
were in attendence which added to the vibe and the vibe surfers merrrily
pounding on the floor to Ms. D's Big Beats.   Afta cutting the rug for a
bit I stepped off the floor and chatted w/my fellow scensters.  Talking to
several other promoters about the BIG events in the summer :

     -" Yeah, I think I'll check out Frankie Bones next month..."

     -"Serious? Christoper Lawrence in June?"

     -"No way he'll spin in SF, when he gets here in the summer, Chris
(Liberator) will be spinning in the Oakland warehouses..."

     -"So he'll be doing his first U.S.A. apperance in the Bay Area?  Are
you sure Commander Tom's never spun in the U.S. before?"
  But enough of the gossip....

After DRC, Mr. Dutch did his Psi-Trance thang and handed the mind set for
Mari who contuned the Goa-ish beats running on till...

                              ... the lights turned on...

People sober enough to understand thier watches noticed it was only 5AM.
Tsk.  Add to the fact that, oh, about 30-50 ppl. from _Bionic_ (@ Maritme)
has just got there to at least party till 6 or 7. (from what I heard
_Bionic_ didn't make thier numbers so they cancelled thier 'free'
afterparty) Tsk, tsk...  A slight discomfort to myself since my slot was
from 5-6AM.  Tsk, tsk tsk.  But mainly, I guess it shows that a party still
CAN NOT go on till daybreak in The City.
                         Mad props to the SFPD.

The unoffical word was that the propritors of the location, "were tired,"
and, "needed some rest."  thus giving the boot to 100 or so partygores to
tweak in the the streets of the Mission... (Please take note to all you
other promoters considering that space...).

Trance Force Rating:  Vibe- 8smiles,  Sound- 7Smiles (it kept getting
turned up...turned down...turned up... turned down...), Lights and Decor-
7smiles, Chill space- 9 smiles (plenty-o-room to relax).  Overall : 7.75
C+.

Hey but that was only night!  SATURDAY it started up all over again:

Sat. was a slight repeat of Friday since I spent the majority of the
evening Mappointing _Foot Print_ till 1:30AM.  Then off, to _Diverese City_
to checkout the haps.  Mars and Mystre were up on the decks tossing down
trance jam after trance jam...  Nice grooves to make you move, but, for me,
sitting in a trance store for 11+ hours,  I guess being indoors was too
much to handle...  So, despite a decent Drumm and Bass set by Noel, the
call of the Sea beckoned me...

I arrived around 3:30ish with some Diverse-City Kitties to _Footprint_.
Suprisingly the cover was still in effect (talking to one of the promoters,
he indicated that after mappoint closed it was to be a 'free' party).
Sonic was spinning an "experimental" set to about the dozen or so people
dancing.  The other 40 or so were piled up close to the fire or wandering
about the beach and ajoining trees...  Chatting a bit I found that the
numbers didn't quite crack 100 but the fact that people trickling in and
out the way they do the numbers of ravers never dipped below 40 either.  Me
and my 'pals' stuck around till about 5:30 or so, Mainly I spent most my
time dancing barefoot in the sand (that alone brought back fond
memories)...  And then drove of to RavensWood (another secret 'smoke spot')
to watch the sunrise.

Diverse City Rating: Sound System- 8smiles (typical club sound), Lights-
8smiles (Typical club lights), Space- 5.5smiles (been there, done that AND
chekin' I.D.'s @ the door AND only till 4). DJ's-N/A (I was only there for
1-to-1 1/2 hrs.). Overall: 7.17 C

FootPrint Rating:  Sound System- 6smiles (2 15's -eeeeh... this is a 5$
party?), Cover- 6smiles (hey guy's outdoors, renegade, shoulda been free
and request for donations),  Music- 8smiles, Location- since it was the
first allnight outdoor in 98 for me,  _Foot print_ gets a coveted 10
(Awesome Space).  So despite the subpar smiles Overall: 7.5 Solid C.


Allthough I heard of _DiverseCity_ afterparty in the Berk Marina and a few
other Sunday daytime events The RAS crew got a bit envious about all the
outdoor parties in planning and happening.  So, Sunday was the serious
Plan-Session for _Casseopiea_ Rebel Alliance Sound's First outdoor event
set for May.  Brining together Trance, Goa,  Acid Techno, Drum and bass and
Hardcore/speedcore/gabber DJ's and Live acts...  (pretty spiffy, huh?).
Local Dj's and artists from the bay contenuing the spirit of the UG in 98.


But since no one's been confirmed and we still have to develop concepts of
decor, flyer design and other trivalities.  More concrete info will be out
soon.
And on the subject of things... An Anakin Spring 98' UG mixtape is floating
about in the scene called _Intrinsic Juncture_.  It's free, get a copy from
a friend (not me, I allready gave out 20 copies).

Well that's about it.   Hope that the society that puts you down dosen't
affect your spirits, and c-ya...
     ... in the void.

OK, so I don't like commercial drum n bass. There, I said it. I was 
commenting that Eklektic plays the kind of jungle I like, as opposed 
to drumnbass that I don't like. Fine, if you want to go to a drumnbass
night, go ahead. I'm not stopping you or saying it's wrong to do so, I 
was commenting that I don't like this kind of music, what's wrong with
that ferchrissake?

Is it wrong to not believe in PLUR on this list? Is it a prerequisite
for membership? Do people who aren't PLURry get kicked off?
Glad you liked Viberation, me n Andy were having a ball up there jumping around and cutting it up.

Yeah, but their market is white suburban people. You wouldn't get the

Hmm. gotta take you to task on this one. I don't know what jungle is 
eh? Well, trust me, I've seen one hell of a lot more jungle than you, 
coming from London and all. I saw LTJ for the first time in 94 in 
Switzerland, I saw Goldie live in 95. And its the cheesy commercial 
watering down of the jungle scene by people like the aforementioned 
artists that really annoys me. Its taking something that was raw and
energetic and came from the rough council estates and watering it down
to sell to suburban people who don't want the rawness of true jungle.
That's why I dissed their styles. The comment about white eurotrash 
applies to me too (I'm white and european, I don't consider myself 
trash but some people would), it was a comment about a certain feel of
music - music can feel black (detroit, jungle) or white (goa trance,
drumnbass). Its a funk thing. It has nothing to do with race or colour
of skin, its about feel of the music. White people can make black
music (e.g. jungle being the best example) and vice-versa. Why are
people over here always actively searching for any comment to be 
vaguely construed as non-PC, it gets on my tits sometimes (is that a
non-PC comment as I don't have tits?). I dunno. 

I think y'all wanna chill out a bit and stop jumping on people for
disliking things. If you don't like the music I like, I won't get 
offended if you dis it, more power to you for saying how you feel. If 
you get offended by my personal dislikes, then that's your problem, 
its not going to stop me speaking my mind about it.

Anyway, we ought to meet up at this goldie thing to discuss it over a
bowl. I'll be with the guy doing the dancing man visuals.

Hey all, I'll be down in your super groovey area on memorial day weekend
and I was wondering if any of you guys could give me some recommendations
for parties.  I'll probably be arriving sometime late friday so I most
likely won't want to go out that night, but will definitely want to get my
groove on somewhere saturday (the 23rd) and even sunday too if there is
anything going on that night.  I'd love some personal insight as to what
kind of parties are happening that weekend.  Such as party size, what the
space is like (# of rooms, size,etc), what sort of music will be
predominant at the party, cost, and anything else that would be helpful.
I've never partied down here so I am very excited for this road trip.
Thank you!
grooving the day away,

Lisa

Hey C@,

First off, I'd like to say that the tone of my post came off more 
indignant than I intended. Sorry 'bout that.

Good point, although I doubt they intentionally market to white suburban 
people, and they would probably argue that their intent is just to bring 
drum n bass to as many people as possible. 

I've always resisted drumnbass/jungle elitism, because I feel that some 
of it's musical innovations (focus on irregular percussion, 
revolutionary bass lines, aggressive tempo, use of "half-time" feel, 
etc.) and it's relationship to hip-hop (as a portal to hip hop music and 
culture for some, as a continuation/branch of hip hop for others) make 
it an extremely important development in 20th century music. 

I think there's drum'n'bass out there for everyone, there'll always be 
"hardcore" stuff that's less accessible, and stuff like LTJ's that's 
more accessible. LTJ's music is important because it has and will 
continue to bring important musical/cultural ideas to new ears. Not to 
mention, IMO, that much of his stuff is very good.

> Hmm. gotta take you to task on this one. I don't know what jungle is 
> eh? 

Basically, I should have said that without LTJ, Goldie, the scenes they 
fostered/contributed to, and the producers that they schooled, most 
Americans wouldn't know what Jungle is. I definitely didn't intend to 
accuse you of not knowing what jungle is.

> And its the cheesy commercial 
> watering down of the jungle scene by people like the aforementioned

> That's why I dissed their styles. 

I can see where you're coming from, but as you can probably judge from 
my comments above, I think that LTJ and Goldie's contribution to the 
scene far exceeds any watering down they've done. If you'll forgive me 
for speaking for them, they believe that the music should be spread far 
and wide, that getting drum'n'bass/jungle heard is a good thing for the 
scene. 

That's a belief I agree with, but even if you don't, their music 
is an important part of drum'n'bass/jungle history, and to dismiss 
everything they've done as rubbish seems... overzealous?

On the other hand, this thread has become way too serious (mostly my 
fault). In person, if you made a reference to lightweight Bukem-esque 
rubbish, I would have smiled knowingly. *shrug*. SO...

That is a great suggestion. I love talking about this shit.  I'll try to 
find a "My name is..." sticker to put on myself, see you there...

so let me get this straight...is it the white people or the suburban
people they are catering to?...or is it just the white *and* suburban
people?....brixton must not have any white people living there eh?
...music is music...like it for what it is not for who listens to it
...there are plenty of non-white urban folks who love goldie and plenty

because you don't say what you really mean...next time say that goldie
creates a watered down version of the original jungle sound...don't go
off on a white suburban tirade...

That flakey fish food is made from Brine Shrimp that have been processed and 
pressed into a form that smaller fish can easily eat and will be attracted to 
eat.  I would not want to eat it, smells funny...but a friend of mine for some 
wierd reason took a whole bunch of that food from another friend of mine, just so 
that he could smell it when he left the other guys house.

Sometimes you need the smoothness to counterBALANCE, understand and truly
appreciate the rawness.  Just because it ain't raw doesn't mean it has no
flavor...it's just cooked longer.  Like roasted vs. raw garlic.

I personally like it with lots of BUTTAH.

White

vice-versa.

oh, you read that article too, eh? i remember awhiles back, there was some
article in a newspaper or magazine or something about black music vs. white
music. that black music is more something that seeps into you, more like
body-sensitive sorta music whereas white music is more of a
head/intellectual thingamabobber. then it went along to talk about how much
popular music was in fact invented by black people and was more of a funk
think like c@weasel says, then white folk picked up on it and made it
digestable for the white masses, like elvis presley, or vanilla ice, or the
beastie boys

it made an interesting comparison between tricky and dj spooky (outta nyc).
tricky's big criticism concerning spooky is that spooky thinks too much
about his music and intellectualizes it too much when, in tricky's opinion,
real music is more instinctual, that you just kinda know it when you know
it and theres no other way of knowing it. both tricky and spooky are black
too, if that has any bearing on anything whatsoever

i dunno, i personally try to avoid this whole polarity between keepin it
real and music for the (white?) masses. sometimes i feel the need for music
that just plain gets me going, othertimes, i like music that i can wrap my
mind around, that sorta fills in the spaces. when it comes jungle (i dont
care about this whole dnb thing, i just call it all jungle), i find i keep
toggling between the different kinds, depends on my mood

I take it they can print out j-cards pretty cheap too?

thats funny that you would consider detroit a black kind of music. i know
that the detroit trinity are basically black, but in terms of musical feel
and the funk thing, id always thought of detroit and most techno as a white
version of newyork/chicago house

	Damn! What a weekend!  First, it was TranceForce Fryday nite...it was 
at the trippiest location -- this funky space in SF with an upstairs, a 
downstairs...*invisible* stairs... (yes, for those of you who are 
wondering, there was this little dinky corner stair that I  consistently 
kept missing EVERY time I descended into the dancing area...verrry 
tricky :)  Very kewl artwork and twisty windy hallways....and the MUSIC 
was incredible!  Nice hard trance, melodic trance (mars), psy trance 
(Dutch for a while...), angry trance (ala DRC :) wierd trance (some dude 
toward the end, don't remember his name)....who cares, it was ALL good 
:)  And it was SO SO SO nice to hang with Steve (finally!!!), Tony, 
Stephen, Mackdaddio, Derek ...and to meet lara, alex...who am i 
forgetting?  ...All in all, a totally kewl party!

Saturday nite was Swadeshi...again at the neatest space (I had never 
been there before, tho there've apparently been lotsa parties at this 
space)....a little warehouse/loft/apartment whatever with an upstairs 
where the dj was spinning in the kitchen!! Gotta love it :))
Music was a lotta mixed stuff that was out of my realm of Trancedom 
:)...but definitely lotsa energie and kewl peeps!!  It was great to meet 
amy, marco, sara, craig, gabbergirl, alex #2 ;> and Guy, and naturally 
to hang with stephen, michael (the VibeMan!) and josh!! You guys ROCK!! 
The party lasted all nite and well into the mornin' and had one of those 
home-grown-rave-vibes that ya just can't find at massives ...(like 
Bionic,blech!)  This made missing the huge goa/psy-festival thingy in 
the desert truly worthwhile (forgive me, G!!)...two great parties in the 
same weekend -- is it a full moon or somethin'??  ;)

I am now recharged and ready for my Week of Hell!!  (insert pouty face 
here)  But inside I am *still* smiling... =)

sending happy Monday vibes!!

Actually, some of those Bwaaaaahpy bass synth sounds are actually FM
synths, some even produced by the venerable Yamaha Dx7-II... Pure
digital sound, as god intended it to be. :-)

PS: I own a Yamaha SY-77. In addition to 6-op FM, you can also FM modulate 
samples with it.

my friend asked me to make a CD-R copy of a tape he wants to preserve
for posterity called "John Howard Live at Sunset"... it is indeed a
very good tape, and I happened to make myself an extra CD-R copy while
I was at it. It sound killer, esp. after a little remastering and
re-eqing with my Finalizer (digital sound processing swiss army knife).

John Howard is god.

So... anybody know when this appearance was taped?

Also, the tape was clearly DATed (i heard a dat mistrack on side 1) and
i'm wondering if anybody has a copy of the DAT of this?

Oh, and if anybody has any good live DJ sets on DAT, I'll be happy to
make a CD for you as long as you let me keep a copy for myself. by
good, i mean preferably house, prog. house, chicago house, garage,
speed garage, interseting non-booyaka-booyaka non-harder-than-thou
jungle (i.e. wimpy white-suburban-jewish-momma's-boy-that-wears-normal-pants
intelligent drum and bass :-)).

well....it looks like the place i live in is being turned into a bunch
of condo's and we need to move out.  so, i am looking for a room in
either berkeley or san francisco.  I prefer a room of medium to large
size (i have a lot of stuff).  

i also need to live with people that can tolerate a little bit of
noise every now and then whilst i practice juggling records.  

any leads/help would be greatly appreciated. 

=)

p.s. how about some free tapes to whoever helps me.  =P

How can you say what *Black Music* feels like? You can only say what
Catweasel music feels like.... and if you're going to bring race into it,
I would assume that you'd be able to feel *white* music, using your own
catergorizing...

I'm African American/Swedish and I take a bit of offense of people
catergorizing music... especially music that touches me deeply... LTJ is a
Shamen and he delivers.... (i'm going to skip the commercialism, as
Dina Alemagna has stated my claim on this... by any means necessary) it's
about his sound... which can only be catergorized as, "Ltj Bukem Style"... 
end of story....  individualism.

Everyone's perception is different... let us meet at the points of our
common interests and leave it at that.... lets no put lines between
ourselves... isn't that what raving is about??.. moving *above* and beyond
*this*... and being *one* once more...

I'm outtie 420 G!

Yes... the music that you listen to has a lot to do with your state of
being.... and music is something that incorporates perception of sound
with empathy.... kind of like jumping into a pool of water based on the
temperature.... I don't want to jump into a chaotic pool of sharks, when I
would prefer a pool of friendly dolphins.. =)

	[Moki]  Is it only me or does anyone else see that to even
intellectualize the discussion of the merits of black music v. white
music and the vibe that accompanies both genres makes my lower jaw hang
and I almost want to puke.

	There is music, created by people.  Ethnic background will
certainly contribute to their musical perspective as will a number of
other traits.  I speak up because I think that this discussioin, or
rather the validation of this discussion perpetuates the stereotypical
differences of what "black" or "white" music does to you.

	If it moves you, great.  But I think the authors of that article
trying to describe the color of music are idiots.  There was an African
drummer in the early part of this century who was renowned historically
as the best drummer able to communicate people's vibe and feelings
better than anyone.  He was known to people as the Mozart or Beethoven
of their time.  True story?  Not really, but it certainly is another
point of view you may never have heard of right?  The point is, which
point of view are you bandwagonning?  

	Music is like water, there are different types but it all flows.
If you can picture yourself flowing with it then it's music to you.  The
color of music is too abstract to quantify, IMHO.  If you insist on
believing in the "black" or "white" thing, then what about other ethnic
groups, what color would their music be, e.g., northern scandinavian
folk music, chinese opera music, middle eastern desert tribes music,
etc.  Ran outta change, gotta go...

	[Moki]  Techno was born in Detroit with Derrick May (he's
black).  It's the grittier side of life and eschewed the bleakness
surrounding the motor city at the time.  Though it may have been adopted
by more whites as a form of music.  The creation of the genre by a
person of color is incidental as I think had it been by some "white" guy
then it's just as redundant.  

	I disagree with you that techno is a white version of
newyork/chicago house.  House music is just that.  Techno has an
entirely different vibe and pattern.  At least I think it does anyway
but maybe you've heard some mixes that were so borderline, it questioned
your definition of both styles.

Why thanks for asking Jil!<
My fish Turlock is about 4  and 1/2 inches long and about and inch and a half
tall.  He is a good fish.  I just feed him the normal, Tetra Fin flakes.  As
for the ingredients......hmm... well lets just say there is some stuff in
there that humans eat. Like: Brown rice, yeast, oat meal (feeding kind that
is), wheat gluten, soybean oil, lecithin.....and the rest doesn't sound too
appetising to my tummy.  Turlock is just yo' average feeder fish that I have
raised since he was a youngen.  If you are a fish lover, don't ever watch
turtles eat, i mean tear apart, fish.  Rather discusting......Right Jil??!

Nuff respect for not letting this degenerate into a flame war - half expected to come back to an inbox full of flames after everyone bashed me for not liking drumnbass.

Yeah, bringing it to as many people as possible also has this side effect of getting very rich and powerful. Strange things happen when money becomes involved in people's motives...

What this waters down to is the age old problem of underground vs commercialism. It's been hacked out time and time again on mailing lists forever. It comes down to whether you believe that getting into a scene will change people for the better, or whether you believe that getting people into the scene will degrade the scene.
Based on my experience of Europe, I stand FIRMLY in the latter camp. What happened there will happen here soon, and I guess there's no way of stopping it - you have to learn the lessons yourself. The powers of commercial mass appeal involve money, and money is a more powerful force of change than music in this world, sad but true.
And I don't for a second believe that the outer appeal of goldie and LTJ and crowd is their real persona, they know the score of how money and power work. anyone who has got that far in the music biz will attest to that. They ain't innocent artists any more.

This tape was made by Jason Brown from San Jose. He also has done a lot of SPUN
tapes (SPUN OUT 1 & 2), a couple of JOSH tapes...and many others. He can
sometimes be found at parties selling tapes...otherwise I would call Solid
Grooves in San Jose to get in touch with him.

music is not *just* music and who gets to define what it is?   it's much
more complex....it's much more political too in a sense, and layered with
meaning and people bring their own valid experiences in deciding on their
own choices and preferences.....and sometimes those preferences arise from
conflicting and multiple reasons e.g. I"m white and urban female and I grew
up in a city and sometimes I"m angry so maybe more aggressive jungle speaks
to that experience but I lived in a sleepy surf town so more mellow music
like trip-hop speaks to that experience too....and so what it is to one
person maybe a totally different thing than "what it is" to another
person....there are no single or simple right definitions of "what it is."

anywaze c@ actually you're choice in music is a political choice....whether
it's politically correct or not is up to some other judge to decide : -P and
you and AndyW did look awfully cute bouncing and cutting up at Vibe This.

hey moki

i dont think you read my post all too carefully or even catweasel's
original one because catweasel (in his) says specifically that labelling
music black or white has nothing to do with race or color of skin but with
a feeling evoked by the music, he called it funk, this is how i understand
it. i brought up color of skin on people in relation to music because i
was alluding to the article which explicitly brought that into the
discussion

essentially, i was paraphrasing this article id read some year or two ago
that catweasel seemed to be paralleling in his post. if youd read the last
coupla lines of my own post, you wouldve seen that for my personal
classificational purposes, i prefer to avoid such polarities but classify
music by the way it affects me, because the different kinds affect me in
different ways

now, sofar as my detroit post goes, i based it on the system of logic
catweasel set forth in his original post: black music has a sense of funk,
white music doesnt. now, when you read that last line, remove all previous
connotations you may personally associate with either the word "black" or
the word "white", especially ones that are related to color of skin.

according to my skewed understanding of things, new york/chicago house has
a sense of funk, because it literally makes me want to shake my butt, must
be the way the bass is arranged, it kinda has that swing to it. therefore,
according to this system of logic that is set up in the last paragraph, i
would call that black music, because its funky. so far as detroit techno
goes, it doesnt seem quite so funky to me, seems to have less of it, if
any at all. it doesnt instinctively make me shake my butt, but moreso stop
and listen to the way the sounds and percussion fall into place
rhythmically and interact with each other. since it dont seem so funky, id
call it white music. so far, this discussion has nothing whatsoever to do
with color of skin

finally, i did mention in parentheses that the detroit trinity were black.
my point in doing so was to stress that this classification has nothing to
do with color of skin since, according to my understanding, the detroit
techno they made i would consider white music (i.e. w/out funk)

ok, i hope this clears things up a little. i have no intention of
offending anyone, i am trying my utmost to avoid it. if i am, and if my
logic fails somewhere in this post, i would honestly appreciate having it
pointed out to me so that i may be set right

So Jam Master Jamie, boomerang, Vertigo, Pengo, Pete T. & his gal pushed up
into the frosty nosebleed levels to cool it with Curious George & the
Alpineheads.  Pengo's cabin was a bust but Curious George opened his rustic
digs to the SanFran Fam, so with 2 sound systems,  30 candles, a box of
glowsticks & a half-dozen vinyl crates we slid sideways over the snowy peak
and into the valley below.

Saturday the rest of the SF kids showed up & we spread out the gear,
squabbling over cables & cursing at mixers as words buzzed through town
about the SF technoheads in the cabin up on Rocky Point Road.  By sundown
the alpineheads-- snowboarders, skiers, townie drunks--  started to roll
in, searching for kegs & finding nuclear glowstick trails instead.  Most of
these cats, I catch, had their eardrums rattled by the techno machine for
the very first time.    The ravers in the house spread the fire until the
rafters shook.   Vertigo stank up the room real sweet, but I'm getting a
bit yawny of all the wet mixes;  i'd fancy it green if the kid would throw
the sneakers in the dryer once in awhile just to let us know he ain't a
calculator.

Pete T. kicked out smooth but cracked the fatal whoopsie of dropping the
volume on a beerflow dancefloor.  Ravers digs the speakers clean & clear,
but the snowjacks & alpinebunnies needed noise to filter the buzz.  Smooth
programming from what I heard, though.

Ryan Newell dropped a pleasant surprise with some wet mixes & friendly
vinyl,  & kept Jam Master Jamie hopping the drunkboy hurdles.

Pengo too popped out some pretty funk, jigged it something fancy after only
4 months at the helm.  One of those "Lemme Scratch Your Record"
drunkspotters made a wreck of Pengo's groove & Boomerang almost laid a
stomping to his soul, but  Jam Master Jamie buried the Boomerang with juicy
lips & made it all peace.

Then someone dropped the 20-Megaton Rubberleg Bomb on the house and things
got mighty butterfly as the beerheads shuffled off to their wheels.  The
rafters shook til 3 or so and the groove stayed nice.

I catch it most of the alpineheads were dropjawed with the vibe.  Mad love
to Curious George for the invitation and the warm hospitality!    :o)

  Many years ago a famous jazz trumpet player, Roy Eldridge, was
discussing this very issue with jazz critic Leonard Feather. Eldridge
insisted he could always tell the race of the musician by the style of his
playing. So Feather assembled a number of records by obscure performers
(since you could easily tell the identity of the famous ones), and played
them for Eldridge without telling him whether the musicians were black or 
white.
  Eldridge guessed the race right 55% of the time.

GOD catweasel haven't you learned yet not to make mention of COLOR? ;) 

you guys *chill*. _maybe_, way back a long time ago, there were racist
roots to the colors found in a standard box of crayolas. however, if
you look up these words in a dictionary, there are quite a few
meanings having *nothing* to do with race. lets not get into the
history of language as we've been there before on this list and i
haven't been subbed all *that* long. must people always search for
something to bicker about? hasn't this gone just a bit too far? the
sun is yellow. does that mean that i'm making a derogatory reference
to asians? if icall something red, am i making rreference to it being
hot or a derogatory remark about native americans? sorry - i just
didn't read anywhere in the post a reference to african-americans.
sort of borders on the self-righteous to think he was categorizing
something (in a positive way, i might add) by your race, don't you
think? ;)

	[Moki]  My point is that to use labels associated with the color
of skin in general evokes racial parallels.  I mean, if jazz has a blue
tone, would it be different if people started saying that there's white
jazz and black jazz?  As I'm sure people already say that, but for the
purposes of our discussion, you can see that using white and black to
describe music denotes too many negative connotations.  I do see your
point but I view it as a non-ethnic point of view, not to cast
aspersions on your remarks mind you.

	[Moki]  I realize that my reaction may have been written a
little too strongly.  I apologize for any discomfort caused to you and
C@t.  It's your personal opinion and you're certainly entitled to it.
You avoid polarities you say and yet it is generally understood that
white is the complete opposite of black.  Furthermore, when you say
music relates to black and funk, well I don't agree that white music or
the vibe of it is devoid of funk.  I think Beethoven's 9th is pretty

	[Moki]  I can't, and I challenge everyone else to act in the way
you suggest to see if they indeed can discount all historical
connotations with white and black.  And why would you use those terms if
you weren't predisposed to do so by influences of our times?  It's
bordering on ridiculous but why can't you use blue or red?  A gang
thing?  How about brown or yellow?  Oh, another ethnic quandary.  Do you
see the pitfalls of using terms with so much excess baggage and then
merely tossing it aside as a trivial coincidence?  As far as funk, I
think that's the deepest of vibes and if the music moves you no matter
what genre then it's got the funk.

> according to my skewed understanding of things, 
	[Moki]  Don't self-deprecate, you don't need to.  I view your
opinions as one made by an intelligent person, it just happens to be
different and therefore unique.

	[Moki]  So you're into the funkier side of dance music, that's
great, so am I.  I think that desensitizing the music with a black or
white label brings the importance of that music down.  I guess I'm
trying to influence you through my own ideas of why continuing to think
of various forms of music as black or white can only lead to confusion.
I mean you always get the "boozies from the burbs" who wanna be down and
all of a sudden after a big rave, they know all about jungle/d&b, house,
trip-hop, etc.  I just think that another term(s) would be better.  I
only reply because there are so many people on this list and I thought
there was another side that needed voicing.

	[Moki]  I disagree, there's funk in it, it just ain't as funky
na'mean?

	[Moki]  We're having a discussion, not an offensive argument at
all so no worries.  IMHO, your logic fails in that you insist on calling
funky music black and non-funky music white.  I think the effects are so
wide ranging that you would be better served if you simply referred to
music that makes you want to shake your butt as funky and the other kind
as not funky, period.  Using white or black only lends itself to heated
debates and perhaps confusion on your intent. 

> joe
> -suddenly feeling a little defensive
	[Moki]  Not meaning for you to feel that way, you have your
thoughts and I have mine.  Both were represented and I understand what
you are trying to say.  I equate our discussion with explaining to
people when they ask me if I'm flip because I look part Filipino.  I
say, "No, actually I'm mostly spic with a little nigger."  A friendly
term to them that was entirely misunderstood.  Hence, my motivation to
reply to your posts.  BTW, apologies to those of Spanish or
African-American heritage but I do use those terms to make an example.
I'm actually Spanish and Filipino, though it certainly doesn't give me
license to use such derogatory terms, I don't give a fuck so sue me.
Hey, just kidding, I don't need another lawsuit but I really don't give
a flyin' rat's ass about the other stuff.  Please feel free to voice
your opinion if you have one.   

	Hey, you got any phat house tapes?  Maybe you wanna trade, I
need some dopalicious new grooves to dance to.  Let me know.  I'm
out...peace be with you...

 With the amount of public attention this list gets, are you truely 
suprised at the fact that succesful UG's are not announced here? The CCC 
party was not even announced on the Goa list!

 There are too many blabber mouths and folks with questionable (read 
disrespectful) friends for SFraves to ever be a place where UG's are 
advertised, not to mention that this list is most likely monitored by 
some police agency.

 There are ways to stay in touch with the UG.

hugz,

BTW the best party this year *will* be Burning Man.

I used to believe that in order to be a great musician, you had to be
either black or English. then I got a clue.

YIkes hide your pets...nick is looking for food for his bbq.
Dont do it nick...even if you're really hungry...dont eat
your pet fish or their food.

Ive always liked fish but sometimes feel sorry for them
in that little glass box eating that dehydrated rice cake
stuff day after day.

Anyone know what kind of music your pets like?
I find fish like ambient and trance altho if it gets too
loud they get annoyed as fish are pretty sensitive.

mastering,1 week or so turnaround, any length.
not sure if they do jcards, but they do on-tape printing.
if they dont do jcards lemme know, theres a good printshop in sunnyvale,
i have to find the name....

Just wanted to drop a quick thanks to all those of you involved in helping
with and being at/with Alice in Wonderland; I had the time of my life, and
the return trip was nothing short of mystical.  In fact, the spirit threw
me into an amazing Sunday as well... it threw off a lot of my (east coast)
jadedness, and was a wonderful welcome to the Bay Area.  I'm glad to see
that the vibe is alive and strong, and that there's a group of people
dedicated to keeping it that way.  Awesome job!

-->Hellow everybody,

	I had a great time and I know that all the peeps that made it over
to my place on Friday had a good time too!!!  Major props to DjNick for
sharing a beautiful sound system, as well as laying down some phat beats,
and I wanted to thank Michael Standish (aka Ulrich) for carrying on the
vibe, as well as Derek and Mark (mook) for touching the vinyl. Big *Hugs*
to Elena, Lisa, Mickey, Lacie, Tony, Josh W., Starchild, and all my other
fine feathered friends for flying from far for five fun filled fabulously
decadent hours of merriment...now all I have to do is get rid of  the
empty bottles :) I hope I didn't forget anybody's name, but I just had a
wonderful time seeing all my friends from different worlds getting along
so well and mingling amiably; but then again, there was all that wine :)
It was amazing that the neighbors didn't complain, but that just shows
what a perfect evening should be about.


This lidda BuddahFlye is feeling all so very warm and fuzzy inside :)

M&m

I think its amusing that you feel that just because someone is involved
in an underground scene, they are supposed to be a better person  I
operated under this same mistaken notion when I was into the
diy-hardcore-punk scene.  Later I realized that just because people
superficially espoused radical beliefs they were not any better people. 
The scene I was in believed in being drug-free, vegan, and fighting for
animal rights, but people who slipped out of the scene became addicts
just like the rest of society, and many of the less relevant scenesters
never even embraced vegetarianism.  The event that finally shook my
belief was when a friend of mine was date-raped by another of my
"friends" who was also a major scenester.  Most rave scenes I've
experienced have at least as many problems as society, if not more.  So
please let go of the belief that you are changing the world for the
better just by listening to music.

I believe that any attempt to embrace the mainstream ends up watering
down the heart of a scene, isn't it enough to let the world know that
the scene exists and let the people with an interest learn to like the
music?


summary/addendum: underground is in no way inherently better than
commercial music, it can only be better by choosing a less destructive
distribution channel and by maintaining artistic control.


sorry for soapboxing on my first mail to sfraves....

is anyone out there listening?

i'm posting this little gig- because the last show that i went to
confirmed my admiration for the band!
if you like slow, trippy, spacey, beautifully melodic music w/ a lush
undertone of vocals...  you'll want to check out these bands!  
i can only speak for sweet trip and andalusia... but if the other two
are half as good as these bands-  you're instore for an incredible
night of dreamy live music!

_trust me on this people!_ 
i've got no connection to either of the bands, yet i'm preaching about
them!
(sort of my remedy to a withdrawl from the band slowdive!)
hope to see lots of you there!!!
parkings a bitch in northbeach...  but that night i might just have to
splurge on a cab!

(ps- i've heard that sweet trip will be going on around 11:30-12am...
but don't miss analusia!)

Hey!  Where was everybody last night??

The music was damn good, but the vibe was all wrong because there were only
like four Sfr peeps there.  :-(

Then it got even worse when some drunk guy started jumpin around spillin his
drink on everybody.  He scared the away few dancers that were left!

Only good thing was that there was room enough for me to do some breakin,
although it was kinda hard due to a sprained ankle.  And when I got tired I
sat back and watched megan.  Damn girl, you sure do know how to move!

So.....Everybody's gonna come to the jungle night next week for sure right?

Hippity Hoppity Frogboix back to the grind.

hello.
I was wondering if you could help me with an art
project that I have am trying to finally finish.

"how can we help pjfuzzy?"

well, if you could just tell me three words that you
find sensuous or erotic.  
And they don't even have to be 4letter words- you can
even use words like cantaloupe or prosthetic.
Just the first three off the top of your head, no
thinking required.
If you send them to me, I may even tell you what they
are for.

'Raver' dies of overdose

By CHRISTINE MAGNOTTA
Pocono Record Writers
cmagnotta@poconorecord.com

EAST STROUDSBURG - A 20-year old Virginia man who came to the
Poconos for an all-night dance party died of a drug overdose
Monday at Pocono Medical Center.

An official at Mount Airy Lodge, the resort that hosted the
event, said Monday it is unlikely similar dance parties,
called "raves," would be held.

Jason Robert Williamson of Virginia Beach died of
"multi-system failure" at 1:36 p.m. after being unconscious
for more than 15 hours at the medical center, Monroe County
Coroner Dave Thomas said.

A second drug overdose victim from California is in critical
condition at the hospital.

"I think the death of any person any time is tragic," said
Alfred Heim, managing director at Mount Airy Lodge. "I'd like
to separate that from the event. I'm a father and can
sympathize with the family of the child. Our sympathies go to
the family."

The 14-hour party, which drew about 8,500 teen-agers and young
adults from several states, "was of a magnitude where I doubt
the owner would allow such a large event to take place again
at the hotel." The rave lasted from 6 p.m. Saturday to 8 a.m.
Sunday.

"I can't see us doing it again," said Heim, who emphasized
that he was not responsible for booking the event. "We're
still recovering from the weekend."

PMVB chief lashes out

In a rare display of anger at a resort, Robert Uguccioni,
executive director of the Pocono Mountains Vacation Bureau,
said no more raves should be held in the region.

"We would strongly, strongly encourage Mount Airy never to
book this kind of a group. Ever. No matter what the rationale,
no matter what the numbers. We are not supportive of this kind
of an enterprise in our area," Uguccioni said. "The Pocono
Mountains Vacation Bureau is not supportive of Mount Airy or
other resorts holding similar events in the Poconos. Period.
Period. Period."

Heim said he would meet with other resort officials today to
assess the aftermath of the rave.

"My predecessor booked it," he said. "I don't think he was
fully aware how it would evolve."

Mount Airy hosted a similar event in September, though that
attracted about 2,500 youths. There were several arrests but
no deaths at that rave.

Police are unsure if Williamson came here alone or if he had
planned on joining others to stay at Mount Airy or its sister
resort, Strickland's Mountain Inn.

Thomas said Williamson's kidneys failed and the victim had to
be put on a dialysis machine at the hospital.

Toxicology reports will reveal what drugs Williamson ingested,
inhaled, or injected, Thoma said.

Family `heartbroken'

Williamson's uncle and grandmother described the victim to one
of the ambulance crew members as a straight A college student.

"They were heartbroken," Leah Murray, an emergency medical
technician with the Tannersville-based volunteer Central
Pocono Ambulance team, said of the family. She drove the
ambulance that brought Williamson to the hospital and then
called the family.

The parents drove up from Virginia, she said.

Murray described the rave, officially billed as an
"International Music Conference," as wild, with throngs of
teen-agers slamming into each other as a live band pelted out
alternative music. She and her crew treated four overdose
patients.

"They made a really big nice mess," she said, adding that the
temperature in the Sports Palace "was about 100 degrees."

Drug arrests

As Williamson lay dying in Pocono Medical Center, state police
from Swiftwater were charging three young adults with
possession with the intent to deliver after they found more
than 100 hits of LSD in a black pouch that was left at the
Ramada Inn at Delaware Water Gap. The drugs were hidden in
chewing gum wrappers.

Darlla Lindaw, 20, of Pasadena, Md., Pascal B. Halabi, 18, of
Falls Church Va., and James E. Martin, 18, of Stonewood, W.
Va., had about $1,000 worth of a horse tranquilizer known as
"Special K," LSD, Ecstasy and methamphetamine. Police expect
to release the details of all of the confiscated drugs
Tuesday.

Some of the pills were in a bag tucked into Lindlaw's bra.

In all, there were 22 drug arrests, police said.

The partiers each paid $25 to attend the event. That money
went to the event organizer, Local 13, of Philadelphia, Heim
said. The organization is a business and is not affiliated
with a union, he said.

"We leased the hall to them," he said. He refused to say how
much Mount Airy received for leasing the space to Local 13.

Heim referred inquiries to a Philadelphia man affiliated with
Local 13. Repeated calls to his home Monday were met with busy
signals. There is no phone listing for Local 13.

Extra coverage

State police scheduled an additional 40 troopers to patrol the
area during the rave.

"From our point of view it ran smoothly," said Sergeant Donald
Fernbach, supervisor of the crime section of the Swiftwater
barracks.

As many as 2,000 teen-agers who attended the concert went to
the Promised Land State Park in Pike County afterwards to
party but were chased away by police early Sunday morning.
Needles and syringes were found at the park.

Police believed some of the teens attending the concert were
also responsible for vandalizing the Martz bus terminal in
Mount Pocono. Initials were scratched into the windows and
graffiti was spray-painted on the building.

Some of the thousands of young adults had gone to the resort
not for the drugs, but for what they called a unique musical
experience they couldn't get in their hometowns.

But in the long run, Fernbach said, the music may not be what
Pocono residents remember of the International Music
Conference.

"I'm sure the event will be overshadowed by the fact that
someone died while attending the concert," he said.

Anyone got any good tips on somewhere to get a nice Amplifier?
Nothing too loud - 50 wpc will do. Just for home use for listening to my decks/CDs.
Are there any second hand electronics stores in SF/bay area? I heard of one down near frys in San Jose, but don't know what it is or where.
Or anyone got one they can sell me?

I just found a really cool site that features a ton of dance titles that
cover several different genre's.  You can listen to the RA samples and
create your own CD mix.  Has anybody tried this and if so would you
recommend it?

> sat back and watched megan.  Damn girl, you sure do know how to move!

HA!
you thought those were dance moves?
naw... i was just trying to mimic those intense ninja moves you were
dishing out!
after hours and hours of pathetic attempts, i decided to go the subtle
route and sway the opposition into submission...  sort of like a snake
charmer does... the only thing that was missing was the snake...  

hmm... maybe i'll find one next week...  
IN THE JUNGLE!


*all jungle next week @ afterglo!!!  :)

As a person who lived in East Stroudsburg for a good part of her life, I
am shocked the local officials even allowed this rave.  Now it will
never happen again knowing how insular the area is and how it reacts
when one party goes bad but yet they give the first day of hunting off
as a school holiday.  it is also just so surreal for me to think of
doing drugs in those places they mentioned considering i know all the
places they mentioned well and  i was not into drugs when  living there.

*weird*  That article was a trip for me in itself....

Hi all!  ]=}

 In light of the recent death on the east coast (thanks for the info 
Troy!) I thought I would post this report.

 At a recent UG, an individual lost touch with reality. Screaming, 
muttering nonsense, climbing on top of a truck and eating dirt where 
only some of the behaviors we witnessed. Luckily it was daylight by this 
time and we were able to keep said person from hurting them self. Said 
person was completly unresponsive to anyone for a long time.

 This person admitted to consuming a lot of MDMA. We also suspect LSD 
was involved.

 BE FUCKING CAREFUL!!!!! You idiots who OD are ruining the scene!!!!

While it wasn't what I expected last night, I had a good time.
The music was some of the best I've heard there, but there
was no crowd.  A few of us loyalists and a few local yokels.
What happened?  Macadio was great and so was Trent.
He kicked my ass.  I admit a lot of it had to do with that one
drunk guy going up to all of you cute grrrlies out there,
spilling his beer and trying to put the mack down on all of you.
I could smell his breath a mile away.  

There were a couple of tracks that Trent spun that I really
have to get a hold of.  Does anyone have his email address?
Does he have a tape of his schtuff?  

Your Jedi Bitch,
jedi666boy

p.s. - And on the megan front...  I'll just keep my mouth shut
before I put my foot in it.  You looked great out there...  ;)

rick- if you get any info on trent... i'm all ears!  

his choice of music was amazing!  some seemed familiar- the rest was
music in a style that i'd never heard before-  _really_ smooth and
intense!!!
nice to hear something different!  kind of a pretty techno...  ? 
uh... is that possible?  <-- sarcasm

you people really missed out!

until next week-> same time-> same place!

Hey You!

I, personally (unfortunately) missed afterglo last nite, but from what
I hear it was all good except for that drunk guy.  Not to totally
stand up for him, but he is my friend, and it was his birthday, and,
yes, he did have a bit too much to drink.I apologize to anyone whom he
might have offended.

Hope to see a lot of glowing SFR faces at *Tricky* this Saturday!!

See Ya!!

Hey -- a few days ago I posted about an experience I'd had replicating the
experience of being high without actually smoking anything. A bunch of
people asked me for more information about this. The book I got it from
has a lot of jargon in it, so I wrote up the process in what I hope is
clear English and put it on my Web site:

  http://www.bowkett.com/drugless/

If you're interested, check it out. :-)

Nope, nothing else going on except the media taking the easy way out, doing
interviews on itself and the stuff it spews, to the exception of all else.
Even alternative media falls prey to this after a while.

Springer? Who cares?  Shit is obvioulsy entertaining (count me in), and
people continue to put themselves up there to be humiliated.  They know
about that show and what it's about, and yet still they go on.  People are
real masochists. ;)

I think there is plenty other things of value worthy for news organizations
to report, but they chose, yes, Springer.  That TV thang loves a sucker.
Why people who sell drugs are penalized far more often, and with stiffer
sentences than those who pull triggers.

Channel 2 huh? I'll watch Frontline instead on Channel 9.

There was a thing on tv last week about how springer
shows are all scripted and totally fake...just like
wrestlemania. The actors are told  what to say
and to wrestle with each other etc. Its all an illusion

Goto www.musiciansfriend.com and check out the Sampson Servo 150...nice
little single-space rackmount amp for $180, I think...50 watts per
channel.  I'm thinking of getting one myself.

On used gear shops...check out Starving Musician on El Camino in Santa
Clara (my haunt) + they have a new shop on Meridian Ave in San Jose...see
www.starvingmusician.com.  Also, check out Guitar Showcase's consignment
shop on S. Bascom Ave in Cupertino?, and I think that there is also some
sort of Music & DJ gear shop at the intersection (or thereabouts) of
Stevens Creek and Bascom Ave...forget the name.

not that anyone cares, but jimg hasn't been to afterglows recently because
he's been at work well into the night, every night, for the past few
weeks, and additionally is, well, um, cranky.  he might be lured out by
the jungle next week though...but he'll just sulk at the bar, wallowing in

Jerry Springer is an asshole and his show beautifully represents how our
society is so jacked up in that it spends too much time giving a shit
about other people's personal business. 

If everyone would just accept everyone else's acts for what they are and
merely take them with a grain of salt instead of trying to change them to
their standards, we would live in a much more respectful society.  Go to
Europe or anywhere else.  When you're pondering why you like Europe ,and
much of the rest of the world for that matter, so much more (atleast in
my case) than America, you'll find that one of the reasons why is 'cause
people are more accepting to things that happen and don't try and change
them to what they think is proper which is a common thing in this
biblically strangled country.

Our society needs to understand how to respect people for who they are
and not to try and change them to their individual standards.  We are all
individuals and we should all be loved and respected for our thoughts and
actions that make us special.

Hmmm, don't mind my rambling.

C Ya'll later.

        Clearly respect for the law breaks down when there are too many bad
laws on the books.  Consider how it would be if the only law we had was a
law against murder -- people would have a lot of respect for the law,
because it would uphold a value that virtually everyone agreed with.  Most
people like to consider themselves law-abiding citizens, so they don't
break the law just for the hell of it.  But when you get to the point where
you have truly stupid laws which openly invite ridicule like the statutes
prohibiting "hate speech" or defacing government currency, people *will*
break the law for the hell of it.  And somewhere quite a way down that path
from laws which almost everyone respects to laws which few respect and even
fewer can wholeheartedly believe in, you will find zoning laws.

        Valid in that they possibly could happen, yes.  But a strong case
for zoning would argue against what's most often likely to occur in the
absence of zoning laws, not against far-fetched hypotheticals.

        All right, now that was a really cheap shot.  8(   I was obviously

        I think there is ample reason to believe that a system based on
private property rights, rather than government zoning, would result in
fewer haphazard and conflicting decisions, not more.

        Right now people wishing to make improvements on their property are
forced to go through a bureaucratic process during which they can be
arbitrarily denied permission for their project by government officials
based on an interpretation of the law, even if no one else objects to what
they are doing.

        At least under a libertarian approach you would know that the
government wouldn't stop you from doing your thing on your own land if none
of your neighbors had a problem with you.  Thus only if there really was a
problem would the law need to get involved, which would simplify matters
enormously.

        If they deserve blame, it's not for failing at an impossible task,
but for thinking they could do it in the first place.  The essential
problem with zoning is that no single person or committee is capable of
guessing the best uses for a particular piece of land within a city's
boundaries.  Neighborhoods change.  People and businesses come and go.
Technologies change, land use needs change.  Even if by some miracle you
could draw up a perfect map today, it would be obsolete in a week.  It
wouldn't matter if the zoning board was composed of the kindest, wisest,
most capable human beings on earth; the process would still be a futile
waste of time, money, and resources in which someone is bound to be
unfairly screwed.

        Yes I'm sure it would, and I acknowledge that it probably would

suspect many others, raves and clubs are not the noise polluters that cause
me the most loss of sleep, yet they seem to be unfairly singled out by the
authorities.  Furthermore, I recognize and acknowledge peaceful slumber as
a legitimate aspiration of the masses.  ;)  However there does not seem to
be a similar recognition among anti-club residents of the legitimacy of
late-night dance parties.  Now you tell me who is suffering from "the

        At the hardcore temples, they didn't believe in faking important
things like death when they could just as easily cut somebody apart for
real to sacrifice to the Earth Goddess or whomever... pretty un-PLUR if you
ask me.

        But maybe they just couldn't afford to hire any decent magicians.
The archaeological record makes it pretty clear that a lot of ancient
religions put the bulk of their cashflow into crafting gold idols.

<Begin MooK's rhetoric>
NOTE: My point is at the bottom if ya don't want to read the reasoning
below.

Actually there are many countries that it is not possible to live outside
the norm withot endangering yourself. In Pakistan (or is it Afghanistan)
they are fighting a Religious Civil war over and if the conservative
muslims win, women won't be able to go outside unacompanied or uncovered.
In China it's against the law to have any religion. In the Serbian area
they're still killin' folks because they are a different race. Almost
everyday in Israel there are people killing each other over land and
religious beliefs. In my home country (Ireland) they've only just this
month made a peace agreement that should last. I can go into greater
deatil and cite more examples but I think you get the point.

This country is notorious for its hypocracy but it does have something
that most other places don't have and that's freedom. Slowly but surely
that freedom is fading as we keep adding new laws and making more things
illegal, but it is more free than a large part of the world. With that
freedom comes the bad as well as the good. But it's the good that makes
having freedom worth dealing with the bad.

POINT: Granted there is a lot wrong with this country, but the freedoms
it offers are the reasons living here is not only bearable but desirable.

If they out law zoning out then only outlaws will zone out.

One thing to think about is that we have a unique situation
here in san francisco area...a little something called earthquakes.

Now when the big one hits which it will within the next twenty
years or less...then much of this area will be wiped out as it was 
before.

So we should make plans to build a city that makes sense.
Lets create a plan that gives us a nice place to play as well
as work and do it in such a way as to make the majority
happy...i would say lets make everyone happy but know thats
impossible here as someone would find something politcally
incorect about everyone being happy at the same time.

hmmm

regardin the Jerry Springer thing in general

its tv, its entertainment... tv shows in general are totally fake, with scripts
and all and no one complains...
then ya have shows like unsolved mysteries which are the same
whas wrong with a talk show with a script?
< IMO the media distorts what is said on the news so much you could say that
half the news is made up too... but thas a whole nuther story =) >

personally i think mistah springah RAWKS... i don't watch him <or much tv
period> anymore, but i can remember many happy latenites < the insomniac
showing is at 2 am i think, or at least it used to be > curled up on the couch
watching jerry and the audience grill the scapegoat guests... I especially love
it when there's a lil brawl and jerry kinna puts his hand up to his face as if
he's trying to look pained that 'ppl resort to violence'... but under that hand
you can totally see a grin, as if goin thru his head is 'HEHEHEH RATINGS'...

i think its art =)
either that or just clever manipulation of the audience < i think thas a joy to
see>... which is what the DAMN ADVERTISERS DO TO YAS DURING THE OVERLONG
COMMERCIAL BREAKS <which is why i dont watch much tv period... that shit
manipulates yer brain in the wrong ways and most people don't realize it... how
many soft drinks do you drink a day??> and ya still watch em...

regardless
springers a helluva lot better than that fakeass dumbdumbdumbdumb <can i say it
again?> dumb <yes> sally jesse rafael or that dumb makeover bitch ricki lake...
and if there ain't a fuckin script on those shows, then i'm... well... mistaken
hehehehe

fergive me if i don't make sense, < right now i got a rilly good reason not to

As someone else pointed out, zoning laws were enacted *because*
"far-fetched" hypotheticals were happening.

And could very likely result with waste dumps in people's back yards, or
total anarchy in the layout of cities. I'm sorry that you feel that this
is far-fetched, but I don't agree.

And what if the neighbors had a problem with what you did *after* it was
up? Are you supposed to tear it down? Are the neighbors supposed to
monitor any changes any of their other neighbors want to make to their
properties?

Starchild, this is pointless. You can argue with me all you want, but when
it comes down to it, you are arguing about how things should be, not how
things are. The club owners are going to win or lose based on current statutes,
and efforts on their parts, not by arguing how things *should be*.

Actually I'd disagree with this 'un-PLUR' comment. All societal values
aren't the same as our being 'the western world' or our being 'america' or
our being 'ravers' or your 'being you :)', values, and just because they
aren't doesn't make them wrong, nor un-PLUR.  In fact, in many societies
it was a serious HONOR to be sacrificed to whatever diety, some cultures
even held contests and the winner was the one sacrificed.

Which in lots of cultures was believed to hold part of the spirit of the
diety and bring them that much closer to their followers. :)

I admit, some of those shows look made up.  But some of those brawls
look really brutal.  At least they aren't stupid makeover shows.  I can't
stand those shows.

Wow what a scary thought! This would enhance every
possible problem you could think of. It would create
caos and would cause police so many problems they
wouldn't have enough folks to cover it. You should
think about that statement again.

Example:
I could be a big time drug dealer. Put up crank labs
all over town. Since I can build anything I want
until you have an issue. When whole neighborhoods
start blowing up you might start retracting that.
Because,
to start with, my lab looks ordinary enough, like a
shed or add on to a house. Its already a huge problem!

Imagine if there were no zoning laws. I could build a
cement runway down my stairwell out on to 20th
street. So I can ride my mountain bike off my second
story.
O.K. the neighbors have an issue because my little
contraption blocks the sidewalk, but there are no
zoning laws so that would have to be determined in
a court of law. In the meantime, I'm building a skate
board park in my backyard for the local kids. Sure
its noisy but again it would have to be determined in
court. You see my point?

Or should you sa,y "How they are never going to be
period." Your right they will win or lose (lose)
straight out - upright. I was at Spundae on Sunday
night and the cops came around 2:00am there were
probably 50 people in the whole club and the music
was turned down considerably. I mean I play louder in
my bedroom with neighbors O.K. They shut down the
upstairs outside and said they might close for the
night. It didn't happen but a bouncer told me point
blank they are on their way out and thats that. I
wish it weren't
true but it is.

I was reading the April issue of Art Week magaziene and it has a really 
well written article(p17) about the art that goes into Burning Man, the 
structure, atmosphere and the fire. Its really quite interesting from an 
art critics standpoint as opposed to a 'raver' standpoint, i reccommend 
checking it out~
have a beautiful day

And this is exactly the crux of the issue! Instead of arguing about zoning
laws, and agreeing with the statements that a lot of noise is being
created by these clubs, efforts gathering and disseminating information to
the contrary to those that do make the decisions is of far greater import.

If it is as it appears a smoke screen, call it that. Document it. And
scream very loudly about it to those that make the decisions with your
proof.

I'm with JSL on this one though. I'm not holding my breath.

i still don't get the rave/BM connection, although it's been made before.
Techno is definitely the dominant sound at Burning Man, but my thought
about it is that the techno is there because of its futuristic,
fin-de-siecle feel.   But there's definitely not anything remotely ravey
about Burning Man, for me.

 in fact, i don't remember seeing any ravers there.  (unless they were all
nekkid!)

cheerio!  :o)

Here's what I do for a drugless high... 
(although you can argue food is a drug) 
 
I eat a lot of pizza 
 
Quantity is about a deep dish medium at Zacherys. 
I guess a good deal of blood from my brain rushes 
to my stomach leaving me somewhat lightheaded: 
I endup being somewhat goofy. 
 
I guess not as intense as what Giles is talking 
about, but my friends and I all definitly reconize 
it as a pizza high!

I agree! I have been attending the board meetings
but more to support my friends that have other long
standing businesses, that I have vested interest in.
Although in a meeting with Mr. Brown we actually
brought this very issue up and he seemed rather
responsive in fact. Problem is, not enough support.
He holds an open forum meeting once a month and you
can speak your mind then. 
We need to make them aware how vital the night life
scene is to the economy of San Francisco and its
a tough call.

John you were right on the money. Everyone talks and
no one walks. Perhaps Vlad can tell the folks were
these meetings are being held again so the dance
scene can get some more support. Although I haven't
yet met with Mr. Martel I plan on attending the next
meeting as well.

It is not a county fair where the promoters pipe in muzak over the "Sound System"
hoping to establish a mood. But if you had drank your water and sat in the shade 
instead of getting heatstroke, you would have found that out.

Now, *I know* you are one of the most non-linear creative/intelligent people on this 
list, so I am going to just delete that statement and pretend I didnt read it.

Remember all those sound systems(pumping differant forms of dance music) you passed by 
in a heatstroke daze. Each of those sound systems were carted out by "ravers". A 
differant crew brought out their own sound system. Maybe your definition of "Rave" is 
10,000 ravers <no outsiders> and a 100,000 watt sound system. 
but some people would call a 500 watt system, 10 dancers, a camp fire 
and 200 naked people walking by banging drums- a rave. 

I saw 7 of those and I didnt make the rounds of the whole place.

Unless someone else has been wigging out and jumping on trucks and eating
dirt at UG's lately...

The person was a little out of sorts (1 hit of blotter), but not on E.

This was a bad trip, not an OD, and there's a big difference Randy (LSD
OD's are something I don't even really acknowledge... at least not in the
classical toxicity sense, although the weirdness of bad trips does tend
to increase with larger doseages).

In light of the fact that this was a personal friend of mine, I'd like to
see this stay what it was, a bad night, and part of the risks associated
with drug use, not some irresponsible kid freaking out from eating to much
vitamin L or E or whatever the rumor chain will eventually make it
(probably fifteen bumps of ketamine and a pound of meth by next week).

The set and setting seemed pretty ideal for dosing (assuming you're into
that kinda stuff), an underground goa
beach party in a really nice location...  the dosage reasonable... the
only lesson here is that humans don't have absolute control over the nooks
and crannies of their brains, we ALL have the potential to lose it every
once in a blue moon and that's why we should look out for each other. 

The message was right on Randy, but the example poor.  I've seen people
eat tens hits and be okay and people lose it on very small amounts...  the
lesson is support and community and the base understanding that you are
taking risks when you put WHATEVER in your system. We should do our best
to take care of our own... that's the unity thing everybody talks about,
but sometimes we just get a little crazy...

Peace,
AndyW

Hi Rave Friends,

        This is kind of a tangent to the whole black/white music
discussion, but I'm curious if anyone can identify for me the specific May
songs or albums, or even the club(s) he spun at where techno was supposedly
born.

        I know he has been widely credited with this creation (in the PBS
series on rock 'n roll, for example), but if one individual is really as
influential here as is claimed, it seems strange that the specifics of this
creation are not more widely known.  I don't have any reason to believe
that May is not responsible for techno, or that the credit should be shared
more widely; I really don't know that much about it.  But if he is indeed
the father of techno, I would be interested in hearing the first music he
produced in that genre.

        Specifically I'd like to know what it was about his music that made
it so different that it came to be recognized as the start of a whole new
musical classification.  I seem to recall hearing that one key innovation
was learning to use electronic equipment like the (Apollo?) 303 to produce
sounds that it hadn't originally been intended to produce, but I'm not sure
if that was a reference to May or to someone else, or even if the first
individual pioneers of the techniques are positively identified.

        I'm sure someone on this list will be able to clue me in on the
history...

May the bass be with us,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

It may have something to do with when you arrived at Burning Man.

Last year my group left SF at midnight on Thursday and arrived on
Friday morning.  Friday night was completely intense -- possibly one of 
the best parties I have ever been to.  There were at least 5 different
rave sound systems set up at various places, each one having anywhere
from 10 to 150 people dancing like maniacs.  Each one had a distinct
musical style and a different "look and feel" from the others.  And
the people were party like it was (forgive the cliche) 1999.  All this
started around 9pm, and it did die down around 2am or so.

Saturday night was way more mellow.  Most of those same sound systems
were not operational at all on Saturday night.  I think people were
saving their energy for the burn on Sunday night.  And Sunday night
seemed to focus on the burn and not really on dance music.

So if you weren't there on Friday night last year, you missed most
of the rave action.

I have been searching everywhere for the Event Horizon soundtrack.
Does it even exist?  I really want to know, and I've been looking for
a long time now.  Does anyone know where I can pick up a copy
of it?  I can probably make it worth your while...  ;)

  I have a Giovanni Grancino violin that needs just a tad bit of
restoration. The varnish is starting to wear and there is a small chip
on the left  flank.  Not enough to effect the sound, but enough to
annoy me.

I've been to several shops in the Monterey and Santa Cruz area and
none of them will touch it.  I'm sure if I venture out into the BIG
city I could find a place, but would feel a lot better if I knew
someone had a place they trusted.

Thanks...

Don't worry, I know it's intense -- I'm from Chicago. (Chicago didn't
invent pizza, we just perfected it.) Pizza's more than a drug, more than a
religion, more even than a way of life. Pizza is pizza.

Subject: Trance or Goa coming up?
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

First off - I'm not on the list so please reply directly if you would!

I don't get out that much - but when I do I like it to be straight-up
trance - or even Goa. Maybe with some d'n'b thrown in for good measure, but
no HOUSE! (nothing personal - it's just not my favorite style, and I run
into a lot of it  already in my regular circles). Where should I head for
this sort of thing? Is there anything special coming up?

I was at a Goa Gil party about a year or so ago - put on I think by the
folks who make the Silver Palms - and I haven't had such a good time since.

I hope this is an appropriate posting (I know it's slightly uncool to leech
off a list I'm not a regular paricipant on - but this seems like a good
place to turn for reliable info).

Thanks for any help!

What you said is so very wrong Derek! My people have
been killing each other, raping each others women, and
bombing each others cities for years over religion.
I can't go to the country where my father was born
or the city for that matter because its blown away.
Its a sad, sick state of affairs and I am ashamed of my
people. Where did you come up with this theory?

Layne Anthony Loomis  2nd generation - former Ugoslovia

I hate the dis' America attitude period. If you don't
like it leave. This country is great for many reasons
and I can tell you that my family would not be alive
without it. Just because Jerry Springer has a TV show
you dis' the country that supports your lively hood?
Its called freedom Derek something you may take for
granted but I sure don't. I'm sorry if this comes
off as a flame I'm just really pissed at that
statement. But I am thankful as ever that you have
the right to say it.

Good day sir.

OK I am finally ready to post this. Awhile back a bunch of folks expressed
interest in doing an SFR road trip down to So_Cal for DUNE. I volunteered to
organize it and so here I am.

I need a head count as to who is serious about going down to experience this
wonderful event and volunteers to drive down there.

 Once I get a list of folks together I will take the rest of this offlist.

So come one lets get silly and show those LA-LA kidz how we do it SF-Style.

Reply back to this address with questions or if ya wanna go thanx.

 oh brother. I don't suppose you want to go into how a raver is 
"supposed" to look now, would you Boomerang?

 I was at the 97 burn. I heard house, disco, techno, trance, psychedelic 
trance... I saw people dancing, hugging, wearing costumes, wearing 
nothing and more artistic expression than you will EVER see anywhere 
else.

 Sounds like a personal problem.

all
>nekkid!)


 We had the 2nd largest sound system at BM last year. Maybe there where 
no candy ravers (although I thought I saw a few) and our camp was a 
dance community rather than a rave, but we were raving and having a good 
time. Hands in the air and raising dust.

Just a reminder Dune is Sat June 6th in Southern California out in the
Desert.

A bunch of people on this list have stories of how awesome the previous Dune
parties have been so I think this year we should all go down and experience
it together.

Shoot, Hernie.

You know when them jimmies start rolling the boomers onto the alkali flats
the sun shines happier than on days when they don't.    But catch:  drip
that wax in the sun, and for what?
Playa dust and techno beats at the edge of the millenium?   Dig that noise
green!  The burning man jimmies bust out of the embryo naked just like the
ravers,  and jam it til the universe collapses.
Acid beats shine sweet the world round.  Embrace that machine, it's the
language of Now.

Night time on the desert?  Stars twist a dome around ravers & burners
alike.  One vibe?    One love?

Find a way to set beats on fire, you'll be Harvey's archangel.

But Funky Tekno Burning Man Rave ?   That soup don't stick.   I reckon you
flipped a microchip.
Hip?  Don't trip.

There's no argument that "American" techno was born in Detroit by 
innovators like Derrick May.  However, electronic music in general and 
electronic dance music in specific wasn't really anything all that new.  
You can go back to albums from teh 60's and 70's and find really great 
"electronica" that wasn't classified yet as "techno".

Of course, there are also the other influences like Kraftwerk, YMO, the 
Art of Noise and others who were really trying to push the limits of 
music and sound recording using modern technology.  

May's big contribution was not the use of electronic devices to make 
music.  I think that the credit comes from the fact that May and some 
others merged that European electronic sound with the rising Chicago 
"house" sound and tried to add to it an element of the angst from life in 
big cities (eg. Detroit).  The result were these highly repetative, 
highly electronic tracks with that "4-on-the-floor" house drum track.  

:/  

I'd be really interested in a compilation of really early stuff from the 
first days of the Detroit scene.

 oh brother. I don't suppose you want to go into how a raver is
"supposed" to look now, would you Boomerang?

 I was at the 97 burn. I heard house, disco, techno, trance, psychedelic
trance... I saw people dancing, hugging, wearing costumes, wearing
nothing and more artistic expression than you will EVER see anywhere
else.

 We had the 2nd largest sound system at BM last year. Maybe there where
no candy ravers (although I thought I saw a few) and our camp was a
dance community rather than a rave, but we were raving and having a good
time. Hands in the air and raising dust.

It's nice to see someone giving YMO credit for a change. ;)

There are several Sakamoto Ryuichi's solo works that are very very cool
eletronica.  If anyone's interested in some cools sounds by the insect pianoman
drop me a line...

(wonder how many will get that reference...) (^_')

BTW, YMO are argued to have been the _first_ to have invented "techno", according
to an NHK special I saw several years ago... ;)

[Moki]  You've got the calendar, so you can aptly "get jiggy with it" as
it were.  I'm not sure if there is a Chicago type calendar and Brent
said he wanted the Chicago house type experience and I recommended the
best bets.  

I still think S.F. has more variety than any city for going out and
dancing to what you want to hear.  Are you finding yourself at a loss
for where to go and what to do in S.F.?  I'm sure people on this list
can give you great advice on where to go.  Good luck.

I try to break the day and nights down in 1 1/2 hour increments so let
me know if you want me to design something for you and I'll try to have
at least three revolving party plans which you can alternately spin on
your floor and then jump off your couch to see which one you land on.
This is more involved than my recommendations with Brent.  But as they
say, for a nominal fee, anything is possible.

May DJ'ed at the Music Institute in Detroit, mid-eighties. I'd argue that
Juan Atkins had more influence over early techno than May, through the
Cybotron and early Metroplex releases, although to some degree he and May
were (and are) contemporaries.

Check Model 500 "Classics" on R&S. The aforementioned Innovator comp for
the May stuff is also essential, and if you get lucky in the used bins, get
any of the Buzz records compilations - "Virtual Sex", "Panic in Detroit",
and " Relics."

Here are 3 short interviews with Kevin Saunderson, Juan Atkins, and Derrick
May, which appeared on the seminal Network records comp "Emotions Electric."

	[Moki]  I mostly chill with Ramiro and the Uniting Souls who
throw the Sunshine Daydream parties when I'm up there.  There are house
parties but you gotta hang with your friends right?  I dig the Mark
Farina sets and more on the funky house side of music.  But if there's
mad true hip-hop jungle then I'm there.  You probably know about most of
the same things I figure are going on.  You just have to keep an ear out
for the unannounced parties I guess.  Like the last phat one I went to
was the Chocolate Factory spinning at the Yoga Center, that was dope and
the crowd size was just right.  Aight den, I'm out...peace be with
you...

I have a CD compilation of some old Derrick May tracks from 1986-1990.  I'd
be happy to make a CD-R copy of it for you if you'd like.

Here are the Derrick May tracks that are on the CD...

Long Ago: "A Relic"
Rhythim is Rhythim: "Beyond the Dance"
Long Long Ago: "Another Relic"
Rhythim is Rhythim: "Strings of Life"
Mayday: "Wiggan" (Stacy Pullen remix)
Mayday: "MS 6"
Rhythim is Rhythim: "The Dance"
Longer than Long Ago: "A Relic"
Rhythim is Rhythim: "Drama"

After many unforeseen technical difficulties, the Static mixtapes are
finally here!

The 2 tape Static set will be available for $10 at both Static and Sabotage
each week until they run out.  Each of the sides contains a mix from one of
the four Static residents- Bre'Ad, Sutekh, Re'Ach, and Quantum23.  The
tapes have been professionally duplicated onto chrome cassettes and come in
a handy dual cassette case with full color insert.

In case you're not familiar with the music we play... Re'Ach and Quantum23
are all (okay, maybe 90%) about dark, brutal drum and bass.  Bre'Ad plays
an eclectic mix of hip-hop, electro, funk, and downtempo.  And I play a
mixture of dark, minimal techno, tech-house, electro, and experimental
weirdness.

We will most likely not be selling these in stores, so if you are unable to
come to either of the nights, then email me and we can probably work out a
mail order deal...  

In case you don't know where to go:  
STATIC tuesdays at Liquid, 2925 16th St. SF (www.nodeOne.com/static)
SABOTAGE wednesdays at Il Pirata, 2007 16th St. SF (www.egatobas.com)

Thanks to those of you who sent me the words.  I'll
try to do them justice in my piece.

I don't really want to say too much about it except
that it could be interactive and that it is kinda
labor intensive so I don't expect to finish it before
end of june.  

I must say that it has been fun playing weekend
psychologist(and use those 70+hrs of psych credits I
have no other use for) and try to make a gestalt for
the word list. (cucumber chains bent= good candidate
for power exchange...etc)

Hiya SFRavers!

I don't know how many of you are planning to come down for Elevation 3 
this Saturday, but I really do look forward to seeing whoever does 
attend!  I will be spinning from 12-1 in the "under the trees" area, so 
please come by and say "Hello!"

I'll have my laminates on n'stuff, so if you're there keep on the lookout.
 
:)

LTJ?

You mean Less Than Jake?

Oh wait.  That's a completely different  genre of music, isn't it.

You meant that Bukem dude.

Whatever.

Hell!!!  If I were given the opprotunity to get paid that much money for doing
a show, you think I would pass it up?  I don't give a flyin fuck.  I'd do It!
Straight up!  Jerry admits that it's the stoopidest show on TV.  But DAMN!
The man gets paid.  And tell me it's not entertaining every once in a while.

I just saw Jerry uncensored.  That was some pretty funny stuff.

He doesn't deserve to be called an asshole.  It's so funny when he makes fun
of the guests and they can't say anything to him cuz he's the host.

If we are talking about drugless highs, I gotta say, the two best things are
skateboarding and snowboarding.  And going to kick ass skapunk, ska, and punk
shows.  And some good jungle/drumnbass events.  And when you finally get your
beats to match.  And when you find that record you been lookin for for days.
Or when you meet an awesome other that just boosts your seratonin levels up to
the moon and back,  more times than even plausible. And I could keep going.
But I won't.  I don't do drugs, unless it's herbal or over the counter.  I
wonder if I could sell tylenol at a rave for $1 a hit?  HA HA HA!!!

"Hey you, don't watch that, whatch this!! This is the heavy heavy monsta
sound,  It's the (n word I don't know but it sounds like) Naziest sound
around.  So if you comin in off the street, and your beginning to feel the
heat, well listen busta, you betta start to move you feet, to the rockinest,
rock steady beat of MADNESS, ONE STEP BEYOND!!!!!"

I think their intro says it all.  It was the most awesome show I have been to
in a long time.  It was like watching 20 or so years of history unfold before
my very eyes.

I haven't danced so hard in so long.  I can still hear the trumpet blare in my
ears, see the drummer fly on his set.

Fuck, maybe I'm not a junglist after all.  Maybe I am a rude girl.  Naw, fuck
dat.  I'm a Rude Girl Junglistic Punk Rock K1dd.  Maybe I'm confused.  Maybe
it's almost 3 in the morning and I am tired, all because I saw an awesome show
(no wait, it was a concert) tonight.

Now it's time for me to get to bed.

Oh, by the way, I am talking about the madness concert I saw tonight. And for
all you ravers who don't know, Madness is an old school ska band.  Kicken ass
STILL baybee.

I've organized a group of about 6 to make the pilgrimage to Dune.  We 
(tentatively) plan to leave Friday afternoon.  It's not a quick little 
jaunt.  I've priced most of the van options, so I can give you info to 
that regard.  This will be one monster-special experience.  Rumor has it 
they've exhumed the bodies of Lynyrd Skynrd and Elvis, fitted them with 
internal robotics, and they will actually spin, being controlled via 
remote by famous international DJs.  Kidding.  But we could in theory 
caravan down there, depending on departures and such.  There are a few 
other groups from SF going as well.  I think SFR will make a strong 
showing!  

Nathan

(ps we plan to leave Friday June 5th)

also -- go to Renalli's on Clark and Division, where you can get a damn
good pizza INSIDE ANOTHER DAMN GOOD PIZZA. I think they call it the
double-decker or something. this isn't even remotely rave-related, but
it's still highly recommended.

Major props out to my new agenda scheduler, Moki, and everyone else who have
given me tons of late night options for my first trip to Chi-Town.

And by any means possible, get to DUNE IV!  Went last year and the word
"party" does not do it justice...

[Moki]  You've got the calendar, so you can aptly "get jiggy with it" as
it were.  I'm not sure if there is a Chicago type calendar and Brent
said he wanted the Chicago house type experience and I recommended the
best bets.

I still think S.F. has more variety than any city for going out and
dancing to what you want to hear.  Are you finding yourself at a loss
for where to go and what to do in S.F.?  I'm sure people on this list
can give you great advice on where to go.  Good luck.

I try to break the day and nights down in 1 1/2 hour increments so let
me know if you want me to design something for you and I'll try to have
at least three revolving party plans which you can alternately spin on
your floor and then jump off your couch to see which one you land on.
This is more involved than my recommendations with Brent.  But as they
say, for a nominal fee, anything is possible.

proverbial cheers,

Derek's plea for universal acceptance is natural and important. What is
more important, however, is acceptance of yourself.  This is the only way
to be truly content. If others don't accept you then we must see that as
very sad and a reflection of their own self-doubts.

If you are still interested, read on:

THE VILLAGE MIND

There is much heterogeneity all over the world guys, and definitely in the
United States, regarding these issues:  acceptance, freedom and violence.
Acceptance in other countries cannot be generalized because of the extreme
variability - it depends highly on what communities one has come into
contact with. Country borders are imaginary, remember - what IS real are
the streets/sidewalks/natural barriers that divide one community with one
set of beliefs from another.

Freedom in THIS country is only as available as the government makes it,
please remember.  We are not an anarchist state. We could have a whole list
just to discuss various freedom issues brought to the courts here, some of
which would amaze you all.  Violence towards others is a different topic
all together, as seen by the existence of it in the inner cities and poor
communities of this free domain (for one example!). Freedom does NOT equal
lack of violence or guaranteed acceptance, just as the existence of
violence does not mean that there is no freedom present (see the horrid
writings on KKK and white supremacy). Subcultures make their own rules and
there are places in the U.S. where you do not have the freedom to be who
you are because someone will persecute you in one way or another.  It is
called the Village Mentality.  No matter how, when or if you encounter it -
NEVER FORGET IT!  Someday we will all be (or have been) challenged in our
beliefs and prejudices towards others and we must NEVER fall to the Mind of
the Village.

Love, Freedom, AND Acceptance

Terri

Rick,
   I'm planning on going. Does anyone know where it's going to be? I'm 
down to meet up w/ sfravers. Just let me know where and when... 
   And to everyone, Have a beautiful day. Although it is a bit dreary 
outside, that doesn't stop us from being bright and shiny inside, so 
make sure to share some beautiful actions and thoughts with the people 
around you. Even if you don't know them, just say 'HI!' or 'Smile!', 
just for some good karma points.

Peace and Love,
Dave

Well then, you'll probably be happy to read the following message taken

Newsgroups: uk.music.rave
Subject: sort of drum and bass with a kinda ska feel.....Brixton
Date: Mon, 27 Apr 1998 20:34:43 +0100


There's been some fucking top new music being played around Brixton
recently, and as I've yet to track it down I thought I'd find out if
anyone elses is listening to it.

It kinda sounds like drum and bass - quite fast and dark - but has an
irresistable ska backbeat to it that makes it really dancy and almost
pogo-able (!)

I first heard it down the Loughborough Junction three weeks ago, and
then some bloke was playing it on a Thursday at the Dogstar a while
back.

It's the freshest thing I've heard for a long time- anyone else been
grooving to it?

Mike
PS Dogstar's open till 2.30 in the week with *no* dress policy and *no
admission prices, same goes for the Junction.

My point is well taken. It has nothing to do with being paranoid (at
least for me, some people may react with paranoia), it is about having
certain rights. I know when I access a computer terminal, and surf the
net / WWW that I give up certain rights to privacy. I know each time I
swipe a credit card, travel, purchase something, etc, that information
is being gathered on me. I know it is highly possible to gather this
information and use it for malicious intent.

My point is, if you have an interest in this at all, to just read it --
and form whatever opinion you wish.

I personally view this as an invasion of my privacy, whether or not I am
in public.
But I am sure, people could argue otherwise.

There are also benefits to surveillance. Hell, it's not like the Fed's
haven't been using this technology for years using Satellites.

Thanks for sharing your opinion.

Thank God, the govt. did something close to good for the people once,
RIGHTS!...We have some yes.  However, as I'm sure your aware of, anyone
who has been alive more than a yr knows that when it comes to Govt.
business, our rights are something of a piece of red tape, or
meaningless if you will.  So, something to be aware of yes, this
survailence issue, but by bringing it up are you merley stirring up the
paranoia?  The underlying fear in us all....of being watched ; 0.....Or,
are you really just passing along information for discussion, in either
case you have done both.

Sooooo......my point, or opinion, (as you asked for), is that the matter
is intresting, but not something to get my feathers in a ruff about. 
Security with computers on the other hand is something intresting to
me.  I like playing cat and mouse with the big boys of the corporate
world......being security consious in the computer world is definatley a
NRR thread worth pusuing, perhaps, if ther's intrest, I'll start one.

As a further TANGENT to the b/w music discussion...

Japanese sirnames preceed the given name.  So the above composer/musician in
question would be addressed as Sakamoto Ryuichi (title) in Japanese.

How to write Japanese names in English and how foreign names should be
written in Japanese is actually quite a hotpot of discussion.  In spite of
being a Japanese/English bilingual and having been in a  position of public
policy for some years, I generally order Japanese names as they appear in
their native order when writing them in English.  I order my name Sirname,
Given Name when writing it in Japanese.  Both conventions buck the
"traditional" and tend to throw people off though... ;)  If you're
interested in why I would do this feel free to drop me a line.  It may not
be appropriate to digress any furhter here.

Regarding Sakamoto's work, I don't have anything at my fingertips but one of
my fav albums of Sakamoto's solo work, I think it was titled "Ongaku
Mokugan".   I think there were a couple tracks in "Merry Christmas Mr.
Lawrence" (??? English title?) from it.  I can look it up later sometime if
anyone's interested.  One of my all time favorite albums though very
ambient'ish though so might not appeal to alot of hte people on this list.

Thank God, the govt. did something close to good for the people once,
RIGHTS!...We have some yes.  However, as I'm sure your aware of, anyone
who has been alive more than a yr knows that when it comes to Govt.
business, our rights are something of a piece of red tape, or
meaningless if you will.

I concur with you there, there is definately something to be said about
government surveillance, which is a great source of debate for us all. I
agree with you that there is little you can do about it, yet, there are
some countermeausures (heck, if they spy on us, why don't we spy on
them?) -- I suppose that is where hacking comes into play.

So, something to be aware of yes, this
survailence issue, but by bringing it up are you merley stirring up the
paranoia?

Not really here to string up paranoia, moreso to inform the masses (if
they care) and to spark a discussion on the issue, since I know it is
close to my heart and may be of interest to other folks.

The underlying fear in us all....of being watched ; 0....'

This is definately an underlying fear. For me, it is more of an
intrusion that I do not welcome, moreso than being fearful of it.
However, I do find the idea of being constantly watched disturbing and
rather frightful. It makes me think of the book 1984 and how things are
seemingly more like that environment as each day passes.

.Or,
are you really just passing along information for discussion, in either
case you have done both.

Passing along info, opening room for discussion from interested parties.
I am definately interested in what others think about this and what
other think should be done about it.

<snip>

Sooooo......my point, or opinion, (as you asked for), is that the matter

is intresting, but not something to get my feathers in a ruff about.
Security with computers on the other hand is something intresting to
me.  I like playing cat and mouse with the big boys of the corporate
world......being security consious in the computer world is definatley a

NRR thread worth pusuing, perhaps, if ther's intrest, I'll start one.

I second that. I personally just find it interesting and want to keep
better informed on the subject. My main interest is compromising network
security and learning better ways to prevent it, specializing in network
crytography and encryption, and changes in the laws that affect the use
of it and it's exportation.

Perhaps this is a discussion you and I should share personally, unless
others are interested in it as well.

Life's Ponderings	

 To handle yourself, use your head;
 To handle others, use your heart.

 Anger is only one letter short of danger.

  Great minds discuss ideas;
 Average minds discuss events;
 Small minds discuss people.

 God gives every bird it's food,
 But he does not throw it into it's nest.

 He who loses money, loses much;
 He who loses a friend, loses more;

 Beautiful young people are accidents of nature,
 But beautiful old people are works of art.

 Learn from the mistakes of others.
 You can't live long enough to make them all yourself.

 The tongue weighs practically nothing,
 But so few people can hold it.

While I see your point, my point was made directly to
certain comments made along the lines that in Europe
you have more religious freedom which obviously is
incorrect.

Now lets state for the record I studied overseas in
France and Germany. I have never been treated more
poorly, as I was in France than any other country in
the world. 

I was born in Columbia and have lived in Panama and
Guatemala as well.(damn close to third world countries)
Where the people did not spit on me (literally).
After our country lost many men trying to save their
country
more than once.

My experience is from living it not just talking about
it or reading about it in a book. I believe Derek has
been abroad as well, so its just different perspective.
Perhaps both of us need to word our responses
differently to reflect this. 

I don't condone everything about this country. Nor
do I believe in the way it is run, completely. I do
know this. No other country has given as much money,
time, and effort to make this world a better place.
Most countries can't even begin to get close. So I
consider the good with the bad and I'm happy to be 
accepted here as an American period. Everything
in-between is people and their interaction with one
another.
 

Derek:

You say the people here "are FUCKED and we are all
egotistical" and yada, yada, yada Derek. I took that
comment pretty personally since you made it so broad.
Be aware of what you say Derek, people remember. We
are not all that way and you become more and more
like that by making judgements on large groups of
people whom you do not know personally.

Thanks for comments folks, have a great day.
Layne

You could recruit an underground community of rebels (probably younger
kids) that all wear minor disguises to shoot black paint pellets at
these cameras when they are located.  You just spread the word to the
young community that this needs to be done and I'll bet it's the next
coolest thing to kill a camera.  That's what you would do, like the rat
hunters in lesser developed countries.  You just keep shooting the
hidden cameras with black paint and render the authorities on their
heels.  But then again, they really do have a bombing threat on the city
so I suppose it's justified in their minds.  And think if some terrorist
groups decided to make S.F. a target for their agendas?  Would you be so
quick to discount using the surveillance system in place in London?

i think that by far...that was the scariest article i have EVER read.

Their gov. now has the means to force their beliefs on u 24/7 and
wherever u are.  George Orwelle wasn't off by more than 9 or 10 years.
 Pretty amazing.

i would still be TOTALLY opposed to it.  It is an outright invasion of

It's the age old debate, does the end justify the means.  Just say that
hypothetically, the city of London had fewer bombings, or even no more
bombings because of this security system.  Would the cameras be
justified then?  

The difference is that the city is not a private place like when you
enter a building or a home, or a store.  But when you enter a federal
building or any other gov't. building, there usually is a security
camera system due to risk factors.  So, since there is a risk factor in
the city of London, you'd be hard pressed to argue against the cameras
being present.  Is it for the greater good?  I would cautiously say yes.


But here's the real crux, what will happen when there is no longer any
bombings and the authorities still have all the cameras up?  And there
you have the real danger.  These agencies will have to justify just like
the CIA and all the other black box operatives.  Immediate saftey always
has a higher price paid by future generations.  

I've lived under martial law and eventually was forced to flee from it.
It's always a little hazy when you talk about a large number of people's
safety.  What do you all think?

Aloha,
Moki

it's a one way street and once u start down it, there is no going back.

i *for one* enjoy my privacy when i am outdoors.  I would rather get
mugged than have a camera staring at me 24 hours a day. I don't want
to be a robot, forced to live by their rules and worst of all their
*ideals*.

U guys can kiss raves and everything else goodbye..cuz they'll be on u
like fly's on sh*t.  No more UG's, not more anything.

sorry.

ramble mode off.

Oh and please do tell which party you're going to be gracing on Sat.
so we can all mark our calendars accordingly.

I mean, God can you imagine if I went ahead and picked a party on my
own?  I might end up at a place that is, *GASP*, out of favor.

Shuttering at the thought of being at the WRONG party.

not to fuel the paranoia or anything, but...

has anyone else noticed all of the tall white poles with video cameras
on top that seem to have been installed along all major highways within
the past few months? and I'm not talking about two or three here and
there.... they are all over the place. I've seen them on 101, 280, 880,
87, 17, etc....

at first i just noticed the cameras at places where there are usually
traffic jams during commute hours and didn't think much of them... i
figured they were the cameras that tv stations use for their traffic
updates and what not... but i keep seeing more and more of them...
sometimes less than a mile away from each other.... my only guess is that
CALTrans is working on an advanced implementation (adding video feed) of
their real-time traffic report that they have been doing in san diego for
the past 4 years or so (which i might add is very impressive):

   http://www.maxwell.com/caltrans/sd/sd_transnet.html

any other ideas about what purpose they serve?

oh, and how about those weird looking devices that are starting to show up
right before the exits for truck weigh stations? seeing as how i've seen
so many episodes of the x-files, i can't help but wonder if someone is
working on a way to scan vehicles as they drive under those 
contraptions... wouldn't that be something...  =)

okay, enough conspiracy theory for one day... time to go relax  =)
it's a good thing i don't seriously think like this all the time...

the music institute was where a lot of this was going on...

the belleville three, generally understood as the trio that "invented" 
techno are juan atkins, derrick may and kevin saunderson. they all went 
to belleville high in suburban detroit. juan is a couple years older than 
the other two, his little brother was in the same class as kevin and 
derrick, a few years behind. juan and derrick (if memory serves) had a 
sound system called "deep space" acutally i think it was juan and kevin. 
anyway they would do these parties around detroit. juan was the first to 
record, one foot in depeche mode, ultravox 80's style... as cybotron with 
another guy he met, at technical college (ypsilanti if i remember) 
outside of detroit. there are other first generation detroiters that get 
less credit though, eddie fowlkes started producing around the same 
time.... i have an almost complete bibliography on detroit techno if 
anyone cares to hit me up for it.. some good stuff has been written on 
it, (but not as good as what's coming ;) .. )

It's insidious...

(I love that word, insidious)

Caltrans last year sent out a brochure about Bay Bridge commute
alternatives to commuters...  How did they know know which cars are bridge
commuters?  It turns out that they recorded the license plate of all cars
crossing the bridge on video, and sent the brochure to each of the auto's
owners.

i don't know what your problem is with 2nd & jackson.  i've been there 
many times & completly enjoyed myself, but then again, i can go to any 
party (even if the location is thought to be "scary") and have a great 
time because it's all about attitude.

lovehugs&kisses,

I think the question here isn't where and how, or even why, (although
that could be it's own thread entireley), but do we care, and if so,
what could possibly done?

I'm partiall to reask my question to hackerlight@deathsdoor..eetc.etc.,
(the one responsible for starting this thread), has this served to stir
up the paranoia inside us all, or is there a valid discussion here or
even actions possible to take.........?

Doesn't the name "Caltrans" sound so much like the ultimate corporate body
in a futuristic movie - you know, the ones who eventually own EVERYTHING
and control what everybody does? Water rations, corporate subjugation via
telemonitors, men in black....

 It reminds me of "The 5th Sacred Thing" by Starhawk

The one and only time I went to 2nd and Jackson I couldn't breath at all. It
was way too hot and there was so much smoke in the air I had to go outside.
I went back in and still had trouble brething so a small group went to a
friends car and listened to a tight mix tape in the company of cool people
and talked about everything. I had a good time but the location was horrible
because of : POOR AIR CIRCULATION & OVERCROWDING. The second problem was due
to the promoters but the first is a building problem.

I think the real issue here that keeps getting brushed aside
is did kenneth starr have sex with clinton
 and then get dumped by the president?

And if they did does that mean we will be paying $25 for e
and $30 for partys.

cause if it does then i think i will vote against the politicians
that support surveilence cameras and invasion of privacy.

If anyone knows anyone who's looking for a place to live for a very short
term (now until mid-june), let me know... Rent is $600/month + deposit, 
it's on Haight and Ashbury, there are 3 other (male) housemates, very fun 
place to live.

   The weekend starts tonight - there are lots of Thursday parties nowadays.
   There's the Jungle Life one-off, and Eklectic and Sound Design; I haven't
   been to Gelatin, the new Royal Jelly, or Raindance yet, but they look
   like they're worth checking out.  

   Last Friday I checked out Bohemian Lounge, in a new (restored) space
   in the Mission, it's a weekly, so you have another chance to check it
   out this week.  Or there's a ton of other events, the Anarchist Disco
   looks old-school, and there's a Cinco De Mayo (pre)party, Casa de Alma.
   Mayday and Deep round out the SF events, then there's Jack Da House and
   Close Up inland.  

   Saturday looks good too, leading off with the AIDS Dance-A-Thon at the
   concourse.  Conscious Session looks pretty good, and FedEx and Intoxication
   look like they'll go big.

   Finally, Monday is the last day to register to vote for the June 2nd
   primary, you need to register to vote for the gubernatorial primary and
   numerous important local initiatives...

>You say the people here "are F**KED and we are all

As a society yes the people here are full of them selves and very
hypocritical.
As individuals, most of us are really nice caring individuals.

>I took that comment pretty personally since you made it so broad.

I hope you don't take this personally but lighten up, Derek wasn't saying
everybody here are jerks, but that most of the societal norm is wacked and
that's where the problem lies.

>Be aware of what you say Derek, people remember. We

I do see the danger of making generalizations and I get upset whenever
anything I am associated with is generalized about, but the greater society
as an enitity does take on a different personality which may be very
different than its members and what they want it to be. In such cases it is
our intellectual responsibilty to identify its differences and attempt to
bring it back in line with the ideals of the people.

MooK<><

Idealists like me get to identify the problems and come up with answers that
"theoretically" work. The rest of you actually have to try and get those
answers to work in the real world.

I love the idea of paint balling the cameras, serves them right, if they
want to use expensive camera equipment, it is open as public target,
just as when some people accidentally hit telephone poles and trees, a
poor camera could be the next victim.

Actually, if SF were a target for terrorists, that might change things.
As I said before, there are good and bad uses for surveillance.

I agree with you in regards to the city of London and bombings.. Where
do you draw the line though?

You could recruit an underground community of rebels (probably younger
kids) that all wear minor disguises to shoot black paint pellets at
these cameras when they are located.  You just spread the word to the
young community that this needs to be done and I'll bet it's the next
coolest thing to kill a camera.  That's what you would do, like the rat
hunters in lesser developed countries.  You just keep shooting the
hidden cameras with black paint and render the authorities on their
heels.  But then again, they really do have a bombing threat on the city

so I suppose it's justified in their minds.  And think if some terrorist

groups decided to make S.F. a target for their agendas?  Would you be so

quick to discount using the surveillance system in place in London?

It's the age old debate, does the end justify the means.  Just say that
hypothetically, the city of London had fewer bombings, or even no more
bombings because of this security system.  Would the cameras be
justified then?

The difference is that the city is not a private place like when you
enter a building or a home, or a store.  But when you enter a federal
building or any other gov't. building, there usually is a security
camera system due to risk factors.  So, since there is a risk factor in
the city of London, you'd be hard pressed to argue against the cameras
being present.  Is it for the greater good?  I would cautiously say yes.



But here's the real crux, what will happen when there is no longer any
bombings and the authorities still have all the cameras up?  And there
you have the real danger.  These agencies will have to justify just like

the CIA and all the other black box operatives.  Immediate saftey always

has a higher price paid by future generations.

I've lived under martial law and eventually was forced to flee from it.
It's always a little hazy when you talk about a large number of people's

safety.  What do you all think?

Quite a coincidence regarding this article and both of our correlations
to the book 1984. Albeit this is not the scariest article I have read,
it definately opened my eyes and made me think long and hard. Next time
you are in public and you want to do anything stupid, just be careful,
there may be a pair of digital eyes on your back ;)

I think you are right about invasion of privacy.. What privacy DO we
have rights to anymore? With society becoming digitized, pretty soon we
may as well all be running around with Microchips implanted in our
brains and the Brave New World making way to take us back to 1984...

This sounds like a book worth reading. Did you perhaps find out what the
title is since you posted this?


I hope things are going well for you.

Thanks a million.

I have seen these cameras that you are talking about. I think you are
right in regards to the Cal Tran Plan. One thing -- I have noticed a lot
of cameras going up in intersections here in the valley (silly con)
which are used to nab peepz who run red lights.

There is a very good chance that they might be using these cameras for
traffic reports, but do you think in the future they might be used for
catching speeders down the freeway using radar? This has already been
implemented widespread along the east coast.

not to fuel the paranoia or anything, but...

has anyone else noticed all of the tall white poles with video cameras
on top that seem to have been installed along all major highways within
the past few months? and I'm not talking about two or three here and
there.... they are all over the place. I've seen them on 101, 280, 880,
87, 17, etc....

at first i just noticed the cameras at places where there are usually
traffic jams during commute hours and didn't think much of them... i
figured they were the cameras that tv stations use for their traffic
updates and what not... but i keep seeing more and more of them...
sometimes less than a mile away from each other.... my only guess is
that
CALTrans is working on an advanced implementation (adding video feed) of

their real-time traffic report that they have been doing in san diego
for
the past 4 years or so (which i might add is very impressive):

   http://www.maxwell.com/caltrans/sd/sd_transnet.html

any other ideas about what purpose they serve?

oh, and how about those weird looking devices that are starting to show
up
right before the exits for truck weigh stations? seeing as how i've seen

so many episodes of the x-files, i can't help but wonder if someone is
working on a way to scan vehicles as they drive under those
contraptions... wouldn't that be something...  =)

okay, enough conspiracy theory for one day... time to go relax  =)
it's a good thing i don't seriously think like this all the time...

It's insidious...

(I love that word, insidious)

Caltrans last year sent out a brochure about Bay Bridge commute
alternatives to commuters...  How did they know know which cars are
bridge
commuters?  It turns out that they recorded the license plate of all
cars
crossing the bridge on video, and sent the brochure to each of the
auto's
owners.

Never intended to stir up paranoia, that is just the gut reaction from

of people. It is always intriguing to see how 25 people see something

I think the question here isn't where and how, or even why, (although
that could be it's own thread entireley), but do we care, and if so,
what could possibly done?

I'm partiall to reask my question to hackerlight@deathsdoor..eetc.etc.,
(the one responsible for starting this thread), has this served to stir
up the paranoia inside us all, or is there a valid discussion here or
even actions possible to take.........?

I found it just browsing Usenet.

That was the Specials...  Interesting how things change and develop.
I'm glad to here that Dammers is still making exciting new music.  Oh
well, if Jeremy Healy (Hayzee Fantayzee) or Boy George can do it,
Dammers is certainly more than welcome to spin.

yes it looks like we have our second candidate for the B.A.R.F. bag,
thats Bay Area Raver FUNd for those of you that dont know.

If this makes you as sick as it does me then please
make a donation to the B.A.R.F. bag.

We can take collected FUNds and buy them a ticket to their next
party or dinner or what ever...maybe even replace stolen article
if we get enough.

I say this with a sense of humor but am completely
serious about doing it. If you would like to make a donation
email me for an address and more info. Even a dollar or two
from several people will get them a ticket or maybe dinner.

I personally like that space. I said THE SPACE, *not* all the parties thrown
there =*)~ What makes a good party there is the type of people throwing it.
Most of the time the parties there are $20 and sell water for $3, but
sometimes there are some awesome parties thrown there. Don't diss the
space/location, diss the way the party was coordinated if you didn't like it.
I mean think about it, a space can always be good, it just depends how its
managed.

I totally agree!

Helllo all...

Well unfortunately I've only been to one good one there (out of 3) and that was
my first rave which was Return To Fantasy Island last year.... and what made that
one good was that they used an outside area so people could actually cool off and
not overheat..... but now for some odd reason noone ever makes an open part....
hopefully that will change with the warmer weather we're having currently.... 2nd
& Jackson, a place of heat and humidity.... hmm maybe a couple GIANT FANS would
help.... just a suggestion... ohh yeah there was a fan at RtoFI..... heheheh

Once again you have all amazed me. The tears have welled up and my cheeks
are salty and now I feel like a big baby.  I was being so stalwart and
stoic and trying so hard not to care.....but when I read your words I
realized how much it all means to me - both to be taken from and to be
given to - and it all sort of flooded out.  Truly, there is no way on earth
I could have asked for more supportive words and offers and it really
touches my heart. In many ways the messages you have sent me have made me
feel so much better - like I can think "HA HA even though you robber
assholes came into my house and disrespected me and took from me and broke
my things and shattered my heart YOU DON'T MATTER because all these people
(some whom I've never met) are willing to take away what you have done to
me and replace it with something BEAUTIFUL!"

That's how I feel.

D. and I are very lucky in many ways.  They didn't really take much - they
got the camcorder with a video of us at a party in it (memories!) the
camera, some jewelry, most importantly some presents passed down to Dina
from family members who (both) passed away from cancer - but we really
don't got sh*t so they were piss out of luck!!  The cops found some prints
on a silver jewelry case, too. They got into my spiritual witchy stuff
which probably scared the hell out of them (I hope!) tee hee.  But most of
all, we are lucky to have people like you to reach out to and to replace
our doubts with trusts and our tears with smiles.

Thank you.

Terri and Dina
