Subject: [sfraves]Did you go to the DirtyBird BBQ?

Wuts up all!!

Just wondering if any of you made it out to Golden
Gate Park for the DirtyBird BBQ?  That shit was dope,
I had a lot of fun.  We got there at like 3:30 and it
was a little sparse.  Grabbed some perfectly seasoned
tacos and a Redhawk, then proceeded to get down on the
dancefloor to some dope house.

By 4:30 it was packed!  I met so many cool people. 
It's been such a long time since I went to a party
like this and the vibe was fuckn awesome.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Question about "Wicked Mayhem"

That's funny, because I always thought Wicked Mayhem lifted 
their name from Yarrow's thing (Mystical Mayhem).

Wicked != Wicked Mayhem || Mystical Mayhem != Wicked Mayhem || 
(Wicked + Mystical Mayhem) != Wicked Mayhem

I met a couple of them, AFAICT they're a group of 30-something 
filipino/asians I haven't seen around before. This is their 
2nd (or 3rd?) year throwing parties. IMHO their 
lineups/production values/venues are pretty decent, although 
the parties themselves aren't exactly my taste.

I know one of the DJ's on their lineup, and he's a fucking awesome House DJ (whatup Hil!), but never met the cats from W.M. before. 

Think I might check out the party just to watch him play- if not for any other reason. . .

peace

Wicked != Wicked Mayhem || Mystical Mayhem != Wicked Mayhem || 
(Wicked + Mystical Mayhem) != Wicked Mayhem

I met a couple of them, AFAICT they're a group of 30-something 
filipino/asians I haven't seen around before. This is their 
2nd (or 3rd?) year throwing parties. IMHO their 
lineups/production values/venues are pretty decent, although 
the parties themselves aren't exactly my taste.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) The Big Career Move

For those of you that don't know, and I wouldn't think that many of  
you do know, I'm currently looking for work in video or web  
production.  I have considerable experience in both work and  
internship experience in both fields.  My areas of strength include  
video editing, camera operator, sound editing, HTML, most related  
high-end apps.  If you hear of any openings in video or web  
production, please contact me, Deepfog, on this email address.

Now that I got *that* out of the way, the real reason I emailed you.   
Should I apply for that web design position at Penthouse?

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/web/706655839.html

I just wanted to be right up front open and honest about it.  I could  
really care less if I get the job or not, I just want to be able to  
tell the younger folks I applied there.  So should I?

So you're looking for work, but don't care if you get a job in the line
of work you're looking for?  Do you not need to work for a living or is
there some other reason you feel you have the luxury of not pursuing
any and all opportunities for employment or was there some difference?

Not knowing you, the only feedback I'd have is that adult content sites
are often the most professional organizations to work with.  They know
what they do and they do it; there's plenty of money to actually resource
key projects; people are expected to deliver, but there's no myth that
one needs to sacrifice personal life for career.

If you think that saying you applied to a pr0n site will make you seem
cooler, it seems just as likely the youngins will actually decide that
you are an even creepier an old guy. :P  I really don't think that's a good
reason to apply for a job.  OTOH, if you want and need a job and this
one is at all suited to your skills and abilities, and you can deal with
the fact that you'll be working for a pr0n company, go for it: it's
good money, reasonable hours and expectations.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) The Big Career Move

well if i was going to take any job i'd get a job at safeway down the  
street.  they are having a job fair tomorrow.  actually i might apply  
for it, i don't know how i'd feel about commuting to palo alto.   
we'll see.  i've actually applied for 50-60 jobs in the last month,  
so it's not like I'm not trying.

c'mon, laugh.  this kind of a job does have to make you giggle just a  
little bit ...

Well, you said you're looking for work as a web developer, penthouse
is hiring web developers.  If safeway down the street is going to have
web developer positions then cool, otherwise they really don't compare.

Do you have a car that gets at least 30MPG?  or live near caltrain?

I really don't see why I would.  The only reason I didn't apply at
kink.com last year was that I found another job about the same time
as they caught my attention.  This is high tech, there's no way to
know when it's going to end so good jobs with good companies having
bright futures is a situation well worth pursuing.  Something like
Penthouse is going to have a steady revenue stream and probably
present you with good long term career options, and maybe even
other options if you find you want to change directions later.

I mean, it's not like you found a web development job with La Pequena.

oops, yeah, missed that.  Yeah, that would suck.  If the job pays well
enough I'd consider moving for it (it's actually one reason I lived in
frakking hayward for the longest time, nearly the entire bay area is
within an hours drive), but otherwise yeah, focus on stuff within
commute range.  If you happen to get a job farther away that's a good
offer, that's when you consider taking it.

If you think what he dropped on Friday was "bass-heavy", then i guess you
ain't heard his harder stuff then... I mean... like i said... he was
pretty light in the beginning & got a lil deeper towards the end... yeah..
Addrian did alota minimal beep bloop stuff during his set, yeah, but imo,
Mo's stuff wasn't like way out there hella far from his set either....
like i said, Mo can really bust the donkey sex humpin' bumpin hard Techno
& well.. maybe he's just goin' through his lil Tra La La Techno phase
right now!  I might have to do an all Techno night soon to re-up my Techno
Groovy again! :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WR so far.... Friday Night Mondo Adventure!!!!



Actually yeah, I've definitely heard harder.  I think it's a combo that
he's been going international more (he did a similar set in Guadelajara
earlier in the month), and the crowd was only about half hardcore heads.
We got some of the "fuck 1015" crowd, and some other folks who walked in
off the street, too, plus he was about at the comfortable limits of the
sound system.  When Cesare vs Disorder played back in March, he pushed
it and got harder bass, but the bottles were starting to rattle off the
bar, not a good scene.  Never scare your bar staff. :)

Still, I loved his track selection, and it was pretty hard for what
folks are used to hearing at Anu.  Between him and Forest, I felt a
little sorry for Developer, who didn't do anything wrong; I just stuck
him in between 2 unbelievable acts.  Anyway, as a total party I'm just
thrilled with how everything turned out.  Huge thanks to everyone who
made it out, the crowd was the best we've gotten yet, and I saw way
more of the list than I expected.  I shall endeavor to keep delivering
the awesomeness as long as folks want it. :)  Heck, I might even start
a 2nd party if I can work out the details (venue, system, visuals, etc).

Coming up next week, Osby is going to do a hard-hitting story on Codex
Alimantarius.  No, but I'm serious we should do a party and call it
that.  Send a message to the NWO blokes that the rave scene is once
again going to save the earth, but it will not be the current model of
fakery and deception that prevails and kills millions every year.
It's time to bring out the Captain Kirk in all of us.  It's time for
Peter to wear a Star Trek Costume to a rave.

I don't know if this was mentioned, but the job is really for 
friendfinder.com/adultfriendfinder.com at their Sherman 
Ave/Palo Alto office, and only *technically* 
Penthouse as they bought them earlier this year.

And I have a friend who did perl programming work for them who has some 
not so pleasant stories about them as an employer.

Karma risk, IMHO.

Subject: [sfraves] Looking for work

Seeing Deepfog's post pushed me in to speaking of my own need for new 
income.  As on old fart, I've got quite a bit of software development 
experience, covering a wide range of areas.  Five years ago, working for 
a not so ethical company (back when the question was, "Still in 
business?  Is it Pr0n or Spam?"), I was driven to escape that reality. 
So I went to work for myself, developing a number of my own web 
properties (some of which I've pointed out here, 
http://www.joketribe.com for instance, and I've got properties dealing 
with Affiliate Marketing, Automobile Purchasing/Safety/Maintenance, 
iPods (http://www.ipod24x7.com), wii's (http://www.wii24x7.com) (I sense 
a trend)) as well as taking the freelance gigs as I was able to get 
them.  Next thing I have lined up is a online store for a local handmade 
soap maker (which is COMPLETELY in the realm of what I appreciate.)  But 
after that....

Working in the AJAX/Javascript realm these days, well versed in various 
Web APIs (eBay, Amazon, etc.), 8 years with the LAMP stack.

My resume is here:
http://kzsu.stanford.edu/~dougm/DougsRes.html

So, if you know of freelance gigs doing web dev. for the little guys, 
non-profit situations, or even development work for the bigger guys, as 
long as ethics are followed, I'd certainly appreciate hearing about it. 
My recent conservation of resources hasn't been so pleasing. :)

Thanks in advance!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Looking for work

Got laid off myself back in late April and all I can say about the tech
market is that there are many jobs available but there are also many
candidates on the market, so companies are having a hard time trying to find
actual talent.

Took me about 6 weeks (twice as quick than last time) but I have three
companies making competing offers this week, so I'm pretty pysch'd. I
recommend contacting recruiters and tech head-hunters as I had more of them
contact me vs the actual companies themselves. I'm sure you know all the job
posting websites but these were the ones I hit everyday:

craigslist
indeed
dice
careerbuilder
linkedin
hotjobs
monster
jobfox (new one but cool)

Good luck on the hunt!

Subject: [sfraves] Looking for work


Seeing Deepfog's post pushed me in to speaking of my own need for new
income.  As on old fart, I've got quite a bit of software development
experience, covering a wide range of areas.  Five years ago, working for
a not so ethical company (back when the question was, "Still in
business?  Is it Pr0n or Spam?"), I was driven to escape that reality.
So I went to work for myself, developing a number of my own web
properties (some of which I've pointed out here,
http://www.joketribe.com for instance, and I've got properties dealing
with Affiliate Marketing, Automobile Purchasing/Safety/Maintenance,
iPods (http://www.ipod24x7.com), wii's (http://www.wii24x7.com) (I sense
a trend)) as well as taking the freelance gigs as I was able to get
them.  Next thing I have lined up is a online store for a local handmade
soap maker (which is COMPLETELY in the realm of what I appreciate.)  But
after that....

Working in the AJAX/Javascript realm these days, well versed in various
Web APIs (eBay, Amazon, etc.), 8 years with the LAMP stack.

My resume is here:
http://kzsu.stanford.edu/~dougm/DougsRes.html

So, if you know of freelance gigs doing web dev. for the little guys,
non-profit situations, or even development work for the bigger guys, as
long as ethics are followed, I'd certainly appreciate hearing about it.
My recent conservation of resources hasn't been so pleasing. :)

Thanks in advance!

I'm working a regular 9-to-5 at this point, unable to stay out late, but
wanting to get out and do something in the evening in SF. What's worth doing
that (a) doesn't cost much and (b) starts before 10 PM?

Thank you for sharing your collective wisdom!

Ah, good to know.  I've seen Penthouse postings every few months for the
last couple years, so I don't pay much attention anymore.

I did interview with friendfinder some years back, they claimed to be
quite interested in learning how to make a stable production environment,
how to create a code release process to reduce the bugs getting out onto
the public sites, etc.  They were also quite adamant that wanting such
and refusing to even consider any sort of code versioning system were
completely compatible.

I'd hope that the Penthouse parents are a little more open to thinking
about software development as a manageable flow...

I think the inherent problem with mom-and-pop online porn shops is  
going to be the talent that will often attract drug addicts.  I would  
think Penthouse would be a little more upscale, but it could be more  
of the same.  And a few other ones came online that I like and are  
more local.  Local and like goes to the head of the line.

What if BART stopped in Palo Alto, then went to Los Gatos and Santa  
Cruz.  What if?

good call.  it's also free before 6pm.

the crowd is "diverse".  if you go for a few times, you'll
start to recognize the regular weirdos.  like "the dad", "the
pogo dude", and other fine folks.

what's up, damon!

Also one of the few weekday parties it's common to see.... chemical
alteration at.  Lots of people end up rolling over to Satellite
afterwards since Anu is close by, so if you start out with happy
hour intentions and decide to call in sick thursday, you've got
options even when it's Cable's off week.  There's also LoveIt
Weds at Icon, but like Satellite, there's a door.  Also, the space
tends to feel more dead than more intimate spots like Anu and Shine.

I'm pinching myself...
It seems too good to be true...
Yet...shit!...it IS true!

Music lovers of San Francisco...

LET'S GET PERLONIZED!!!

Berlin's living legend rocking a 2.5 hour DJ set in the intimate basement of
the 222!


[KONTROL] presents:

SAMMY DEE (Perlon, Poker Flat, Hello?Repeat)

aka Half Hawaii (w/ Bruno Pronsato)
aka Pantytec (w/ Perlon founder Zip)
aka Schneider & Radecki (w/ Guido Schneider)

***exclusive SF appearance***


[KONTROL] DJs warmin' things up:

Nikola Baytala / Craig Kuna / Alland Byallo / Sammy D


opening "farewell" set by Berlin-bound:

James Bass (Bassaholics Anonymous)


live visuals by: Heroic Robot

________________________________________________

Thursday June 5th, 2008  //  222 Hyde, SF  //  9p-2am
$10 / no guestlist / 100 capacity / first come, first served
________________________________________________


*** THERE ARE NO PRESALES ***

Anyone who's been to 222 knows it's, shall we say,
"intimate".  With a maximum capacity of only 100, this
event is sure to pack out early. When we're full, we're full,
no matter how VIP you think you are.  Thus, we strongly
recommend arriving before 11:00pm to ensure entry.


 *** THERE IS NO GUESTLIST ***

Due to the small venue size we are asking that each and
every person through the door cough up their share to help
cover the fee, airfare, and accomodations for this top notch
talent!  The price was set at $10 each to just cover breaking
even. Thanks for understanding and pulling your weight to
allow this special event to occur with such short notice!

________________________________________________


Sammy Dee is truly one of the best in the business!

We're all in for a real treat.  See you tomorrow.   :)

Woo HOO!  Am so happy someone else made it happen, I was trying to get
him (and Bruno, but hey, one miracle at a time) and just couldn't get
it to happen this week.  

Nice to see my new visuals crew getting some bookings, too.  These two
are just so amazing to me; they deserve lots of parties. :)

I'll be there bright and early.  Any chance 222 will ofter tuesday pricing
on pizza?

East Bay loft space.  You'll be hearing sets from SJ techno legend Mattski
of DoBox Recordings, SF favorites James Bass and dCOY, as well as the Radio
Integrated team; STML, Disconnect, and Chelsea Faith.
...I should mention that James will be moving back to Berlin next week, so
come by and say Auf Wiedersehen to Mr. Bass before he departs for the Techn=

Capital.

If you absolutely must stay home, you can still tune into Radio Integrated
at http://radio.defsf.com:1200/ to listen to the party, which we will be
broadcasting all night.  However, for optimal enjoyment, we strongly
recommend you join us here at the Bliss Factory and stand next to one of ou=
r
bass bins.

Love Chelsea for Radio Integrated

best sets of the weekend @ this year's DEMF, so hearing him in the intimate
basement of the 222 with a bunch of 'heads is going to be quite a treat.

there are no presales and no guestlist for this one (if it's full we should
just break even).  it's very likely to fill up so please don't lag if you
want to make it in for sure.

there's a happy hour b4, from 6 til 9. come down early and catch a farewell
opening set by SFR's own James Bass, who's moving to Berlin on Tuesday.  :(

[ K O N T R O L ]

3 YEAR ANNIVERSARY

minimal techno + avant house
every 1st Saturday at The Endup


featuring from London via Berlin:

RADIO SLAVE

Rekids . Poker Flat . Get Physical

Matt Edwards is easily one of the most unique and important
artists in dance music today. Sure, he runs a label (Rekids),
has loads of aliases (Matthew E, Quiet Village, Sea Devils,
Rekid, Radio Slave) and produces hits of his own, but what
truly sets him apart is his ablity to reimagine the music of
others. The jaw-dropping list of artists he's remixed includes
Carl Craig, Kylie Minogue, New Order, Justice, Trentemoller,
UNKLE, Sasha, Tiga, Bob Sinclar, Slam, The Pet Shop Boys,
Clipse, Moby, Paul McCartney, and countless others. This
man has amazing records no one else has and an inimitable
style all his own. Listen and learn!


and from Stockholm via Berlin:

PAR GRINDVIK  ** live PA **

Drumcode . Spectral Sound . Stockholm LTD

P=E4r Grindvik has been an integral member of the Swedish
electronic scene since the 90's as record store owner,
label manager, producer and performer. His rigorous touring
schedule and well-received releases on Drumcode, Spectral
Sound, and his own Stockholm LTD have made him a
respected player on the international scene and prompted
his relocation, like so many before him, to the Mecca of
Minimal, Berlin, Germany. Hot on the heels of performances
at Miami's WMC and a main stage set at Detroit's Movement
Festival (DEMF), don't miss his driving yet intelligent live set
in one of only four US appearances!


plus special guest:

MONTY LUKE   ( mothership . demon days . xlr8r )

with resident DJs:

SAMMY D   ( classic . dirtybird . utensil )
ALLAND BYALLO   ( nightlight . auralism . leibe*detail )
CRAIG KUNA   ( platform . esdjco )

RADIO SLAVE  (aka Rekid, Quiet Village, Matthew E)

No matter what sounds you profess to be your music of choice, chances are,
that at some point over the last five years, you will have got your rocks
off to Matt Edwards.

As Matthew E he fashions club-based, dancefloor slayers. Under that aegis
he's updated the classic Chi-town, jackin' sound beloved of house
aficionados and layered it with fractured funk, belligerent, oddball beats
and mechanical soul.

If Matthew E is all about the Saturday Night Fever, then, by contrast, Reki=
d
is the slower, more deliberate, rhythmical funk of the mid-week mayhem. Its
well-intentioned muscular intensity making it perfect soulful sustenance.

Quiet Village is something else all together. A collaboration with long-tim=
e
musical sparring partner Joel Martin (a vinyl freak, like Mr Edwards, who
works in esteemed auction house Christie's pop department), it's
sample-based music which veers from drawn out disco-not-disco delirium to
evocative, under-stated soundscapes.

Sea Devils - you keeping up at the back? =96 is undeniable electronic pop
brilliance. Working with Tom from Cagedbaby, it's the least niche of Matt's
projects and thanks to Sea Devils alluring pop dance grooves they'll no
doubt be shagging the upper reaches of the hit parade sometime soon.

Last, but by no means least etc, etc, etc, is Radio Slave. Perhaps Matt's
most instantly recognisable nom de guerre, thanks in part to his
inspirational melding of Kylie's Can't Get You Out Of My Head to New Order'=
s
Blue Monday, this is Matt's DJ moniker and the guise under which he
completes his incendiary remixes and re-edits.

However, before such sonic schizophrenia gets you calling for the men in
white coats, just feel the quality and consider Matt's legacy. Fired by the
first wave of acid house, Matt gained his musical spurs by partying to danc=
e
music that was just that: music you danced to, irrespective of tribal
factions.

This was the raison d'=EAtre he acknowledged when he took to the decks, fir=
st
at London's legendary Milk Bar in 1992, then onto the, then, recently opene=
d
Ministry Of Sound and then to parties across the country, most notably in
Wales =96 where he was a regular at free parties =96 and in Brighton, his h=
ome
since 1998.

His love of re-edits, dance music's oft-forgotten backbone, led Matt into
the studio himself. His own re-edits and remixes, such as the aforementione=
d
epoch-defining re-imagining for Ms Minogue, soon gave way to his own
productions and since the floodgates opened there's been no stopping the ma=
n
known as, erm, Matthew E, Quiet Village, Sea Devils, Rekid and Radio Slave.

He's released records for Skint, Soul Jazz, Classic, Whatever We Want, and
he's worked with fellow travellers, Belgium's The Glimmers. If Matt comes u=
p
with another two projects he'll have enough alter egos for every day of the
week.

Psychologists would probably have a field day with him; mercifully, we don'=
t
have to worry about any crisis of identity, we just get to keep on dancing.

Well it looks like I might have secured a part-time job as a  
conspiracy fucktard like Rense, Kidd, and all those other people that  
you read one line of them and instantly shut out everything they have  
to say.  More on this later.  But I'm just putting it out there, if I  
get a full-time gig being a bona fide conspiracy theorist, I will have  
the hugest barbecue, and I hope you like bonfires and flumes:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5-7OaG2Spk

... so be on the lookout!

--

We had an email come in and it goes like this:

What I want to share is I brought home one of the restaurant packets
of Equal, or maybe it was the pink stuff, and sprinkled it all over
the laboratory floor, where the little brown ants appear each year.
They have never came back.

... only humans can be convinced that this is something good to eat.

That was fucking cool!!! 

You guys have a great spot, it's really alive in there. It's not often enough that I can go to a party, and leave lifted & inspired. 

Saw some SFR friends & made some new ones. Great music + great vibe. Thank you again Disconnect & Chelsea for starting my weekend off proper. 

peace!

East Bay loft space.  You'll be hearing sets from SJ techno legend Mattski

Integrated team; STML, Disconnect, and Chelsea Faith.
...I should mention that James will be moving back to Berlin next week, so
come by and say Auf Wiedersehen to Mr. Bass before he departs for the Techno
Capital.

If you absolutely must stay home, you can still tune into Radio Integrated
at http://radio.defsf.com:1200/ to listen to the party, which we will be
broadcasting all night.  However, for optimal enjoyment, we strongly
recommend you join us here at the Bliss Factory and stand next to one of our
bass bins.

Yum Yum!  I mean.. i dunno, but like those 2 just dropped alota Groovy
Tunage... James brought it proper, I wanna say like kinda techy & smooth..
then STML brought it deep & edgey! :)

It got kinda harder when like Mattski played his set 'cause like he busted
out Detroit Techno Stylee & uuuuuugh... i mean... i danced alot during
this set.. OK... then dCoy got on & oooooh my gosh.. he busted out really
so totally mondo harder harder stuff... uuugh... I couldn't stop like I

[ K O N T R O L ]

3 YEAR ANNIVERSARY

minimal techno + avant house
every 1st Saturday at The Endup


featuring from London via Berlin:

RADIO SLAVE

Rekids . Poker Flat . Get Physical

Matt Edwards is easily one of the most unique and important
artists in dance music today. Sure, he runs a label (Rekids),
has loads of aliases (Matthew E, Quiet Village, Sea Devils,
Rekid, Radio Slave) and produces hits of his own, but what
truly sets him apart is his ablity to reimagine the music of
others. The jaw-dropping list of artists he's remixed includes
Carl Craig, Kylie Minogue, New Order, Justice, Trentemoller,
UNKLE, Sasha, Tiga, Bob Sinclar, Slam, The Pet Shop Boys,
Clipse, Moby, Paul McCartney, and countless others. This
man has amazing records no one else has and an inimitable
style all his own. Listen and learn!


and from Stockholm via Berlin:

PAR GRINDVIK  ** live PA **

Drumcode . Spectral Sound . Stockholm LTD

P=E4r Grindvik has been an integral member of the Swedish
electronic scene since the 90's as record store owner,
label manager, producer and performer. His rigorous touring
schedule and well-received releases on Drumcode, Spectral
Sound, and his own Stockholm LTD have made him a
respected player on the international scene and prompted
his relocation, like so many before him, to the Mecca of
Minimal, Berlin, Germany. Hot on the heels of performances
at Miami's WMC and a main stage set at Detroit's Movement
Festival (DEMF), don't miss his driving yet intelligent live set
in one of only four US appearances!


plus special guest:

MONTY LUKE   ( mothership . demon days . xlr8r )

with resident DJs:

SAMMY D   ( classic . dirtybird . utensil )
ALLAND BYALLO   ( nightlight . auralism . leibe*detail )
CRAIG KUNA   ( platform . esdjco )
NIKOLA BAYTALA   ( robsoul . junior boys own . s.w.a.t. )

RADIO SLAVE  (aka Rekid, Quiet Village, Matthew E)

No matter what sounds you profess to be your music of choice, chances are,
that at some point over the last five years, you will have got your rocks
off to Matt Edwards.

As Matthew E he fashions club-based, dancefloor slayers. Under that aegis
he's updated the classic Chi-town, jackin' sound beloved of house
aficionados and layered it with fractured funk, belligerent, oddball beats
and mechanical soul.

If Matthew E is all about the Saturday Night Fever, then, by contrast, Reki=
d
is the slower, more deliberate, rhythmical funk of the mid-week mayhem. Its
well-intentioned muscular intensity making it perfect soulful sustenance.

Quiet Village is something else all together. A collaboration with long-tim=
e
musical sparring partner Joel Martin (a vinyl freak, like Mr Edwards, who
works in esteemed auction house Christie's pop department), it's
sample-based music which veers from drawn out disco-not-disco delirium to
evocative, under-stated soundscapes.

Sea Devils - you keeping up at the back? =96 is undeniable electronic pop
brilliance. Working with Tom from Cagedbaby, it's the least niche of Matt's
projects and thanks to Sea Devils alluring pop dance grooves they'll no
doubt be shagging the upper reaches of the hit parade sometime soon.

Last, but by no means least etc, etc, etc, is Radio Slave. Perhaps Matt's
most instantly recognisable nom de guerre, thanks in part to his
inspirational melding of Kylie's Can't Get You Out Of My Head to New Order'=
s
Blue Monday, this is Matt's DJ moniker and the guise under which he
completes his incendiary remixes and re-edits.

However, before such sonic schizophrenia gets you calling for the men in
white coats, just feel the quality and consider Matt's legacy. Fired by the
first wave of acid house, Matt gained his musical spurs by partying to danc=
e
music that was just that: music you danced to, irrespective of tribal
factions.

This was the raison d'=EAtre he acknowledged when he took to the decks, fir=
st
at London's legendary Milk Bar in 1992, then onto the, then, recently opene=
d
Ministry Of Sound and then to parties across the country, most notably in
Wales =96 where he was a regular at free parties =96 and in Brighton, his h=
ome
since 1998.

His love of re-edits, dance music's oft-forgotten backbone, led Matt into
the studio himself. His own re-edits and remixes, such as the aforementione=
d
epoch-defining re-imagining for Ms Minogue, soon gave way to his own
productions and since the floodgates opened there's been no stopping the ma=
n
known as, erm, Matthew E, Quiet Village, Sea Devils, Rekid and Radio Slave.

He's released records for Skint, Soul Jazz, Classic, Whatever We Want, and
he's worked with fellow travellers, Belgium's The Glimmers. If Matt comes u=
p
with another two projects he'll have enough alter egos for every day of the
week.

Psychologists would probably have a field day with him; mercifully, we don'=
t
have to worry about any crisis of identity, we just get to keep on dancing.

I'm glad everyone had fun!  A nice group of people showed up.
By the way... Someone left a nice brown hoodie with an embroidered design o=
n
the front on our couch.  People leave shit here all the time, but this
sweater has a "favorite hoodie" vibe about it... Anyone know the owner?

 HAHAHAHAHA.



Oh, man. Diggin' out the oldie but goodies, eh? Who the fuck put a
glowcircle around my neck?! I mean, I was all about the candy love (http://flickr.com/photos/littleetoile/225003980/sizes/l/in/set-72157594251774354/ and I still have all 6246826343 of my bracelets, necklaces, rings, and anything else you could possibly make out of beads) but I was never so hot on the glowsticks. Eeesh.

And yep. I was 17 in that pic. :) That means Becca was 19, and Tina was.. 20? I think that's right. Man, time flies....

Where are you, my fellow old ravers?

     * Rafael Behr
     * The Observer,
     * Sunday June 8 2008
     * Article history

There isn't much adolescent idealism on a gym treadmill. I see  
grimaces of fellow thirty-somethings atoning for their sedentary  
lifestyles. The soundtrack to this purgatory is techno. Relentless and  
urgent, it is meant to spur people on. Ung-cha, ung-cha, ung-cha.  
Must. Work. Harder.

Electronic dance music is part of Britain's audio furniture. It  
reverberates in bars and clubs, is the soundtrack to TV shows, adverts  
and radio jingles. And it always plays in gyms. It was there that I  
found myself pondering, as I hurtled on the spot, the peculiar fact  
that this music was once illicit. Those bangs and bleeps are  
descendants of the music I used to know, and love, as rave, which was  
controversial enough to be singled out for statutory censure.

Twenty years ago, dance music was the property of a subculture, a  
mostly hedonistic but implicitly political movement, anti-materialist,  
collectivist, draping itself in the flowery colours of 60s hippy  
revival. The summer of 1988 was dubbed the 'Second Summer of Love'. Or  
was it 1989? No one is sure, evidence of how incoherent it all was.

But the government certainly thought it dangerous. In 1994, the  
Criminal Justice and Public Order Act made it illegal for people to  
gather in fields and dance to music 'characterised by the emission of  
a sequence of repetitive beats'.

Britain didn't invent house and techno, but it was here that, through  
raves, dance culture induced a hysterical conservative backlash. That  
is largely because of the drugs. Raving accompanied an explosion in  
the use of ecstasy. But it also represented, like punk, a reaction  
against the political status quo. Rave was youth culture's  
counterpoint to High Thatcherism.

Eventually, the whole thing dissolved. The Criminal Justice Act pushed  
dance music (and drugs) into nightclubs. The record industry, as  
always, captured the trend and milked it. By 1997, New Labour was  
using D:Ream's 'Things Can Only Get Better' (imitation rave) as its  
anthem.

There is nothing unusual about subcultures turning mainstream. But  
when the punks combed their hair and got jobs at least the musical  
aesthetic stayed radical. When the original flower-power generation  
grew up, they changed the world.

But while the aesthetics of the 80s dance revolution colonised popular  
culture, the political consequence was tiny. Labour didn't need votes  
from disgruntled ravers to win in 1997.

Some nostalgists argue that rave was vital to the growth of  
environmentalism or that protests against the Criminal Justice Act  
turned people on to the techniques of direct action. But none of those  
things is now associated with the music.

Imagine a formula for calculating the impact of a subversive youth  
culture. It would factor in the scale of moral panic, the  
effectiveness of subsequent hijacking by fashion and music industries  
and changes in values that were smuggled into the mainstream. Rave  
would come out as the biggest sell-out ever. Consumerism won hands down.

The 20th anniversary of the 'Second Summer of Love' is coming and  
where are all the ravers? Some have surely penetrated the  
establishment. There must be barristers, bankers, even ministers among  
them. The repetitive beats are everywhere, but the rave generation is  
invisible. We pound out our hippy idealism on the treadmill.

 Yeah, no shit. People *still* think I'm seventeen (or younger, even!).

Age 16:

Me on my birthday last year (and trust me, not much has changed since then, either!):
http://flickr.com/photos/littleetoile/2564884839/sizes/l/in/set-72157600511705201/


 

I think I'm the fountain of youth..?

 You mean the second pic? The recent one? Well you have to hear the back-story on it, really. The first version of that pic we took, Eric joked that Galen ruined it because he was busy staring at my tits, so the second pic, Eric and Natalie decided to stare at my tits while Galen looked away bashfully. It was a moment in time never to be forgotten. ;D

Chuck 2nd Sunday was good there is nothing like partying hard during the da=
y sometimes. The colors and the day look trippy when blazing and drinking. =
Blazed and while blazing multiple times watched on my car's DVD player part=
s of Fat Boy Slim =96 Big Beach Boutique and The Rules of Attraction on the=
 street near Mission Rock.=20
=20
I was just listening to Shinichi Osawa - Electro411 on my iPod and that son=
g is sick as fuck. Dude got down on the track and the sleeve art is kind of=
 cool if you can display it on iPod/iTunes.=20
=20
Another sick track tearing it up on my iPod is Martin Solveig - C'est La Vi=
e. After a few times listening to the song on the radio I started to like t=
he beat in the background and from there the song plays well with me for a =
quick listen....

http://money.cnn.com/2008/06/09/technology/applekeynote.fortune/index.htm?cnn=yes

NEW YORK (Fortune) -- Apple announced on Monday a much faster iPhone that's half the price of the current model.
The news is expected to address one of the biggest complaints about the hugely popular iPhone: That its network is too slow. CEO Steve Jobs said the new iPhone, which is based on 3G technology, is 36% faster than top rival Nokia's N95 smartphone.
As Fortune.com first reported, the new 8-gigabyte iPhone will cost $199 and a 16-gigabyte version will cost $299. Jobs says the new iPhone will be available worldwide starting July 11. It will allow up to six hours of Web browsing and five hours of talk time. 
Jobs announced the 3G iPhone, which had been rumored for months, at the company's annual World Wide Developers conference in San Francisco.
Apple shares fell 4% after the iPhone announcement, as some investors were left wanting more from the gadget maker. The stock had been up 55% in the past three months on heightened expectations for a radically improved iPhone and the possibility of other product launches.
While the price cut was good news for consumers, U.S. iPhone partner AT&T said it would feel the pinch of having to lay out a subsidy for the new phone. In a press release late Monday, AT&T said the iPhone costs will cut adjusted earnings by about 11 cents this year and next.
AT&T's exclusive iPhone partnership also calls for the company to share as much as 24% of its monthly iPhone service revenue with Apple. 
During the show, Jobs also introduced a slew of new applications for the iPhone, including a wireless system that automatically forwards e-mail to other devices, a friend-finding service called Loopt and mobile blogging software from TypePad.
Other new applications for the iPhone include a service from MLB.com that provides a live scoreboard of major league games, and music-making software, called Cow Terry, for creating songs on the phone.
The new iPhone applications are aimed at boosting revenue from data services. Wireless companies increasingly are looking to these services to offset slowing growth in mobile phone sales. Apple, for instance, will charge $99 a year for its new MobileMe service, which sends e-mail, contact and calendar updates to a user's devices.
The new services drew plenty of 'oohs' and 'aahs' from the 5,200 attendees at Apple's developers conference. But the main attraction was the 3G iPhone. 
Since the original iPhone was introduced nearly a year ago, Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) has sold 6 million handsets, Jobs said Monday. The company has set a goal of selling 10 million handsets worldwide this year.
But iPhone users have complained loudly about the cumbersome EDGE network, which is operated by AT&T (T, Fortune 500), the exclusive seller of the iPhone in the United States.
Jobs kicked off the conference by talking about the iPhone for business users, a lucrative market dominated by rival Research in Motion (RIMM). He said that the iPhone now works with Microsoft's Exchange office server systems - a key feature if the iPhone hopes to crack the BlackBerry's lock on working professionals.
Jobs also said that 35% of the Fortune 500 has participated in a beta program for business applications for the iPhone. 
Also, Jobs announced that the new version of the Mac operating system OS X is called "Snow Leopard."

I just keep my head high.  I guess I'm made of something that Brandy
Britton wasn't made of.  You know, I've got something in me.  What
that is, it can't be defined, but there's something in me that won't
let 'em get away with it.  And I'm not going to let these bastards get
away with it.

I just got back from Heavenly this past weekend. It was great weather  
during the day. A little chilly at night (around 36 degrees). Plan  
accordingly.

That said, I'm sad I likely won't make it. Some year I will, dammit!

i agree with everything and have a few to add.

hippi headbands that wrap around your forehead. this shit is ugly and you
are not original or unique.

Checkered oversized neck scarves. see above for reason.

mid calf flat pointed toe boots. wtf? are you digging through peter pan's
laundry?

this list could go on, but i'll spare you.

Subject: [sfraves] CODA folks, and Seventh Swami on KZSU tomorrow (Thur.) morning!!

We've got a BIG morning in store for you tomorrow on KZSU.  It all 
starts with The Eclektronic Groove at 6a Pacific time, and runs through 
An Epiphany Of Sound until Noon.  This week we'll be featuring 5 
seperate folks in control of the beats.

First off is Holt, with a live mix for you from 6a-8a.  Check out his 
place on the web at http://hsomusic.com/

He'll be followed up by The Ambient Mafia's very own Seventh Swami from 
8a-9a, taking you from downtempo to midtempo to glitch and dubstep 
(hoping he can squeeze it all in one hour! :) )  He bridges the gap 
between "Live PA" and "Mashup DJ" in his performances by bringing 
together classic DJ techniques with glitchy effects, live sampling and 
on-the-spot remixing.  I'm expecting him to bring you a set that is 
spiritually uplifiting, original and thought-provoking.  The same sort 
of set that I'm expecting he'll bring the folks you partake in the 8 Yr. 
Anniversary of Stilldream.  (See http://www.stilldream.org for all the 
details!  I've had an amazing time all the past years that I've gone, 
and I'll be on the decks again this year BTW.)

At 9, we swing into An Epiphany Of Sound mode with 3 seperate folks who 
will be playing at the CODA Love Fest Float benefit party this weekend; 
Jason Knight, Ron/e, and Jeff Richmond.

Jason Knight is a 15 year musical veteran, bringing a wide range of 
sounds from Ambient/Downtempo, to Progressive House, Tech Trance and 
Trance, with 6 releases under his belt.  (Check him out at 
http://www.djjasonknight.com/)

Ron/e and Jeff Richmond are two more CODA residents (check them all out 
at http://codasf.com/music.html.)  Ron/e is part of the crew that 
brought you the Deep End and is also a resident at FiX.  Jeff Richmond 
is part of the crew that brought you the wonderful Aranji parties, and 
he loves to expand our consciousness with his brand of funky techno and 
house.

All I can say is look out!!  This is going to go down in the record 
books. ;)

All you need to do is tune in to 90.1 FM in the bay area, or listen 
online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu (KZSU is also in the iTunes radio 
directory.)  It all starts at 6a Pacific Time, so set your alarm clocks!

Peace all!

Understating inflation makes real GDP growth appear higher. If  
inflation were properly measured, the US has probably experienced no  
real GDP growth in the 21st century.

Well, that depends on who you're asking. A radical feminist would think of
Maddox as the devil incarnate, but I don't really see the harm in his

Seems like everyone took a break at once, where are all the parties to

Is that the place with the cows who commit their own sepuku to free your
conscience from killing them and also ensuring sustainable freshness or
something? :)

I know the much thump guys are having a party tomw, and ISTR there's a
house party at folsom, can't remember anything straight up techno though.

Of course, I'm broke right now, so cheap fun parties are much preferred.
(Also have to head up to sonoma tomorrow morning until mid-afternoon, so
things that play well into that schedule are even better)...

Nice,

Has anyone heard the mash up os "Summer in the City" Its very
breakbeat and I cant identify the artist. It was an ad on Bobby
Digital's myspace but I can't find it. Also, I am coming in from NYC
on the 20th. I am looking for parties in the city on the 20th or 21st.
Any recomendations?

Subject: [sfraves] Thank You from Audio Shwag & Tiki Reveiw

So I saw alota y'all come out to the Sexy Tiki Time shindig we threw
lastnight in the Mission... OK... I just gotta say from an outsiders POV,
then the venue was fuckin' ILL!!!  The venue is this ummm... multi purpose
building that has ummm... civil rights offices, a ballet/ symphony reheral
hall, a general meeting room/ make shift theater (the room we where we had
the shindig), & well... I guess ummm... classed for visual/ audio arts
too.... This was the 1st time I went to this venue ever & I would be so
damn happy if another yummy underground was there in the future 'cause
that spot is so perfect ;)  Lastnight the vibe was reeeeeally thick & it
was a good time all around... I haven't felt that many positives vibes &
good energy like that in a long time :)

>From an insiders POV... I'll just say that after all the crazy
misunderstandings, miscommunications, & confusion happened, everything ran
prety smoothly... lol... & the security guard of the building like started
work @ 6AM this morning & our lil underground ended @ 5AM... seriously..
stike & clean up literally took 45-50 minutes & we were outta there I'm
sure within a few minutes of the Security Guard getting there!

But yeah... it was an amazing night! :)  Thanks 4 Groovin' with us
lastnight!!! :)

I saw pics of the Stilldream venue, not the ones Paul released 
but from the actual venue website. That place is GORGEOUS!

I hope everything goes well, has all the makings of an epic 
event.

Me...went to a lil Cloudfactory gathering on friday and had a

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Mon)

--

I began a recent presentation before a large group of cattle producers  
(R-CALFUSA) by showing a paper dollar bill and a silver coin. The  
words ?one dollar? is inscribed on both the coin and the paper, yet  
the paper dollar will only pay for about one quart of gasoline at  
today?s prices, while the silver dollar will pay for well over five  
gallons. I explained to my audience that consumer prices are not high  
? the paper dollar has lost most of its value. It makes no difference  
how high the price of gasoline goes, a silver dollar will continue to  
buy gas for 20 cents a gallon, exactly the price gas was during the  
Great Depression. Based on 1940 prices, a paper dollar is worth about  
two pennies.

Yes, and yes. Went there my first time for the Daft Punk show last year, it's a badass outdoor venue, with a cool view from the hill. 

Hit me up offlist, we should catch up there.

I was digging up some old files on a computer I haven't used in a few years,
and I found some videos of DEF's float in Love Parade 2004, as well as the
Love Machine afterparty held at the Drum Machine Museum / Infinite Kaos
space.
Early in the day, before the parade had started moving, we met a Dutch
couple, Brenda and Alex, who had come all the way out from Rotterdam to
check out the parade.  Brenda was a photographer, and Alex was a techno DJ
who brought his records along with him in hopes of spinning on one of the
floats. Our float was one of the smallest, but it was the only one playing
techno, so he came over and introduced himself to us and asked if there was
an open slot. When I scheduled the lineup for our float, I left an hour
free, so that when we inevitably fell behind schedule, I wouldn't have to
cut any DJs short.  I seriously doubted that we'd have any extra time, but I
told Alex that if we did, I'd let him play on our float later in the
evening. Amazingly, everything went off with no problems or delays, and we
were totally on schedule. At 6pm, I gave him the decks, and he threw down a
set of hard, hard, HARD techno, and totally rocked our socks. It was
definitely one of the highlights of the DEF float.  Afterwards, we brought
Alex and Brenda along to the Love Machine afterparty, where Sean was DJing.
 It was a pretty epic party - still one of my favorite events in recent
memory. A week or two later, Brenda emailed me the videos she took from the
parade and the afterparty.  I thought they were long lost, but now that
they've turned up I thought I'd share them with you guys...

I just doubt that the value of gasoline relative to the value of
silver is really the same as 1942. I know the value of silver has
increased, but not with the rapidity of gasoline. I 'got' it, but the
statement just seems too simple to be true. I'd have to go actually
find the value of silver and oil then vs now, and i cant be bothered.

It's also a way of showing how gold and silver keep up with or exceed  
inflation.  Just remember when FDR confiscated all the gold and those  
that gave it up then had the price raised on them.

Nice post, some VERY interesting data, especially in the first table. I'd like to see a comparison of what we pay for gas vs. Europe during that period.

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] !!Happy Hour, Friday, Serious Business!! (Dinner Party Records!)

Hello, friends,

Each month I tell all of you that you need to make it to our Happy Hour at 222 Hyde.  Each month I tell you how it will change your life, get you laid, improve your hair, and protect you from existential harm.

This month, I MEAN IT!  We've got not one, but *THREE* illustrious guests.  Serving everything from the grimiest funky shit to classic house ass-shaking and a whole lot of wildcards in between.  Whether you call them agents of The Ambient Mafia, or mistakenly identify a couple of them as Pandas, you owe it to yourself to hear their clarion call.

Sixty4K (We Are Not Pandas, Ambient Mafia)
Hickory (We Are Not Pandas, Ambient Mafia)
Squelchy (Ambient Mafia)

And DPR Resident, yours truly:
George Cochrane (Drop Music, Amenti Music, The Fingermonsters)

222 Hyde (@ Turk)
San Frandisco

7pm-11pm, and stay after for No Fucking Requests Ever!

Cheers,
-GC

Hello, friends,

Each month I tell all of you that you need to make it to our Happy Hour at 222 Hyde.  Each month I tell you how it will change your life, get you laid, improve your hair, and protect you from existential harm.

This month, I MEAN IT!  We've got not one, but *THREE* illustrious guests.  Serving everything from the grimiest funky shit to classic house ass-shaking and a whole lot of wildcards in between.  Whether you call them agents of The Ambient Mafia, or mistakenly identify a couple of them as Pandas, you owe it to yourself to hear their clarion call.

Sixty4K (We Are Not Pandas, Ambient Mafia)
Hickory (We Are Not Pandas, Ambient Mafia)
Squelchy (Ambient Mafia)

And DPR Resident, yours truly:
George Cochrane (Drop Music, Amenti Music, The Fingermonsters)

222 Hyde (@ Turk)
San Frandisco

7pm-11pm, and stay after for No Fucking Requests Ever!

Cheers,
-GC

I finally digitized my decaying, 10+ year old VHS tapes of the the only TV
show that ever mattered, AMP.  Sean and I have been watching these tapes
over and over for... a long time! They are on their last legs, so I figured
I'd better save them now before it's too late.
I put one episode online for you guys to watch -
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8769457740285482862&hl=en

I have lots more... Hopefully I can find a way to host the videos that is
better quality.  Any suggestions?

Love Chelsea

Chelsea, THANK YOU for this! :-)
I LOVED AMP. I used to gather around the TV with all my Chico friends
and watch it every Friday and Saturday night. It was the most original,
innovative, and awesome hour of programming MTV ever generated, and
probably ever will. I sent those f*ckers at MTV so many d@mn emails
asking them to bring back AMP... bah. I miss it.

Amp was pretty major for me too. As a young teenager, this was my
introduction to electronic music.  "These bands have no lead singers... and
the videos are CRAZY! What *is* this???"  I tried to get my girlfriends from
school to stay up late and watch it with me, but they weren't very
enthusiastic.  I specifically remember writing about it in my diary at the
time - "My friends want me to come to the Third Eye Blind concert with them,
but I'm really starting to get into techno..."   Ha!
I have many more episodes coming, stay tuned!

 Hello again, SFRavers.

First off, we at [KONTROL] all wanted to say a heartfelt thank you to each
and every one of you who came out to help us celebrate our third anniversary
on June 7th. The vibe was thick, the music was spot on, and the Endup was
hoppin'!  Holy cripes, have you ever even seen it that crazy in there
before?  Wow.  Thanks again for three incredible years, everyone. We do it
for you, and we certainly couldn't have done it without you!

Next, we want to tell you about what's sure to be a very fun show happening
tomorrow (Wednesday) night. MVP Entertainment and Love It! Wednesdays are
hosting the [KONTROL] DJ crew (minus Craig Kuna, who's in Europe at the
moment) in a one-night-only whizbanger at the intimate Icon Lounge. As much
as we love the Endup, sometimes it's nice to mix it up and see your
favorites play somewhere new, and Icon will definitely scratch that itch.
Come check out the boys droppin' their freshest wax alongside Love It!
resident Mikey Tello and enjoy a fine adult beverage or three with us!

Full details, address, etc. right here:
http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j78/tellomatic/LOVEIT_KONTROL_PosterWeb.jpg


Set times are as follows:

0900-1030 Michael Tello
1030-1145 Alland Byallo
1145-0100 Nikola Baytala
0100-0215 Sammy D


Hope to see some of you out tomorrow!

components.

*ABOUT DECIBEL FESTIVAL* Founded in 2003,
Seattle's Decibel Festival (http://www.dbfestival.com) bridges the gap
between technology and creativity through visual art, workshops, panel
discussions and cutting-edge electronic music performances. By assembling
a diverse selection of international talent, Decibel Festival provides a
forum for musicians, industry professionals and educators alike. The 5th
Annual
Decibel International Festival of Electronic Music, Visual Art and New Media
is scheduled for September 25 through September 28, 2008.

I'm there with you.  There was very little electronic music to buy in the 
music stores of central California, and I got some exposure to the more 
popular artists in the 90s via AMP.

Fond memories indeed!

love always

It's not my fault you fuckers are too lazy to earn a proper living in the
exciting field of prostitution.

I haven't posted to this list as much as I used to.  Today marks a  
year since I left hospital after a life and death struggle with spinal  
meningitis that left me unable to walk among other things.  Months  
more lying in a hospital bed at home struggling to relearn walking.   
Lots of time to think about things like the brevity of life and the  
primacy of family and friends.  Love while you can.

I haven't been out and about much and have become a bit of a recluse.   
Me, a believer in the life giving force of social, tribal dancing.  I  
so hope I can experience the ecstasy of the dancefloor once again!!

Then I learned of my daughter's tragic death.  Amoret was my only  
child. News came on Wednesday last week;  she apparently died of a  
heroin overdose at a party on June 1st and her body lay in the Tucson  
morgue unclaimed until last Wed.  So I have been living terrible pain  
and darkness the past few days.

So, finally a bright spot...today Joey, my partner of 30 years, and I  
got married!!!

We had not planned to, especially in the middle of this grieving.  I  
made an appointment to get a marriage license as soon as I heard the  
CA supreme court ruling.  We got a slot for the first full day of  
issuance.  We did not expect to marry.

But we had that appointment and no possibility of getting another one  
for at least a couple of weeks so we went into SF City Hall to pick up  
the license.

Once we got there Joey and I were swept up in the positive vibe.  All  
the happiness;  surrounded by couples like us who never thought they  
would see this day;  and an efficient, welcoming City administration  
smoothing the way.  It was all wonderful and we became a part of the  
joyful historic moment.  We were married on the balcony at SF City  
Hall feelin' the love of the community we had fought so long and hard  
to help facilitate times like these.

And a legal marriage solves lots of problems like who has the  
authority to decide when to pull the plug when one is on life support  
and fading fast.  Fortunately I executed powers of attorney when we  
first got together, so Joey overruled my doctor who was following my  
instructions ("let me die if it looks like I can't dance again") and  
kept the respirator on.  Now we have clarity on a number of long-term  
relationship issues.

But the important part was looking in his loving eyes while we were  
reciting our vows.

Love,

Apollo

Apollo,

I'm so saddened to hear about your daughter.  I can't even imagine dealing with the loss of a child under any circumstances including these.  

But life goes on and I am equally heartened to hear about your marriage.  Congratulations!  Love triumphs in the end.

I'm proud to be a Californian today!

And as always hope to hear from you more often here abouts whenever the mood or opportunity strikes...

Regards,

Peter

holy shit, thanks so much!

back in college, I would make all my friends hurry back to the ol' UT
dorm room to watch it every week.  very influential to me, if for
playing dj shadow's "midnight in a perfect world"  religiously.

Hey lovelies,

Would anyone be willing to do set recordings for Two & Four this Friday? It's in the city. I'll give you guest list and liquor you up, of course. ;)

Lemme know! And thanks so much in advance. These sets are not to be missed and I would hate for them to be lost in raver abyss. 

Loooooove,
Alida

"There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid  
them. But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles for  
your dreams than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're  
fighting for."  -Paulo Coelho

"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap of  
empathy, which transports us into the soul and heart of another  
person. ln those transparent moments we know other people's joys and  
sorrows, and we care about their concerns as if they were our own."  - 
Fritz Williams

"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone,  
but it worked for me." -Hunter S. Thompson

Hey guys...
I thought I should mention that my electronic disko band, Easystreet, is
playing at Gilman in Berkeley on Saturday night. It's an all ages show,
doors open at 8pm, and we're going on second at 8:40. This is likely to be
our last Bay Area show, so come dance with us before we vaporize! There
might even be candy canes in it for you....

Yay fun!

Love Chelsea

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Connectivate Friday June 27th

Hello all,
Hoping you had a fantastic weekend!  I'm hoping to wrap my head around a 
good way of describing the Stilldream experience of this past weekend, 
but I'm having a little trouble with it right now.  (And yes, as Terri 
mentioned, the space was an amazing one.  There's already some video up 
on SeventhSwami's YouTube page.)  Will get to that when I'm able to 
describe it well.

In the meantime, I want to give everyone a heads up about an upcoming 
event that I'm taking part in; Connectivate.  My understanding is that 
it's the finale, so you should consider experiencing it while you can. 
(But also, one should never say never. ;) )

The Sera Phi building, where the party takes place, will be closing down 
shop and the Connectivate folks are going to be having a grand ole 
blowout to celebrate the occasion.  This last Connectivate will feature 
delicious foods, great music and fun workshops.

*Your Djs for the evening are
*Cumulus (WoM), Chris Sia, Neptune, Deft, Outersect (Outersect.net), Genji,
Dov (Muti Music, Cyberset) Audiovoid (Layers, Muti Music),
Raydeus (Pronoia), Seventh Swami (Ambient Mafia), Beyta,
Niles (MK2Systems) , Unagi (WoM), J.C. (KZSU, AuraSF) and more TBA...

As per usual there will be 2 rooms of sound to tickle your guts, including
one room with 14 subwoofers built into the floor.

Delicious foods will be served up by The Sera Lounge: 
http://www.seralounge.com

Please come join us as we say good bye to this unique space.

Connectivate
Friday June 27th
9pm- 6am
$10 General $15 with Workshop
2829 California St
San Francisco, CA 94115

it's the finale, so you should consider experiencing it while you can. 
(But also, one should never say never. ;) )

The Sera Phi building, where the party takes place, will be closing down 
shop and the Connectivate folks are going to be having a grand ole 
blowout to celebrate the occasion.  This last Connectivate will feature 
delicious foods, great music and fun workshops.

*Your Djs for the evening are
*Cumulus (WoM), Chris Sia, Neptune, Deft, Outersect (Outersect.net), Genji,
Dov (Muti Music, Cyberset) Audiovoid (Layers, Muti Music),
Raydeus (Pronoia), Seventh Swami (Ambient Mafia), Beyta,
Niles (MK2Systems) , Unagi (WoM), J.C. (KZSU, AuraSF) and more TBA...

As per usual there will be 2 rooms of sound to tickle your guts, including
one room with 14 subwoofers built into the floor.

Delicious foods will be served up by The Sera Lounge: 
http://www.seralounge.com

Please come join us as we say good bye to this unique space.

Connectivate
Friday June 27th
9pm- 6am
$10 General $15 with Workshop

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: FISA telecomm immunity, again!

So they're at it again.  House Democrats (Pelosi & Hoyer) have come to
a "compromise" on the FISA telecom retroactive immunity act (H.R.
6304), which is basically a capitulation, giving the Bush admin
exactly what they want, while attempting to keep up appearances so the
natives don't get restless.  At this point I'm almost positive that
Pelosi is either criminally liable or being blackmailed regarding
this, otherwise I don't see why they'd sell out so damn easily.

What's worse is it appears they're trying to bundle it with the War
Supplemental to ensure it's passing!!!.

You won't see this covered on TV unfortunately, so it's only spreading
on the net.

Here's a link with more info:

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/6/19/135436/413/558/538470


PLEASE call your representatives as well as Pelosi and Hoyer and the
Obama campaign, who have been strangely silent on this :(

it's kind of complicated too, of course. i'm supposed to bring down a 20' x 20' shade structure for the main stage. i had transport arranged but cancelled at the last minute (this morning). i think i can offer free admission to the festival if someone with a truck can get me and the tent down there tonight or super early tomorrow and then back to the east bay monday afternoon....

"An adult is one who has lost the grace, the freshness, the innocence of the
child, who is no longer capable of feeling pure joy, who makes everything
complicated, who spreads suffering everywhere, who is afraid of being happy,
and who, because it is easier to bear, has gone back to sleep.  The wise man
is a happy child."
-Arnaud Desjardins

"Music rots when it gets too far from the dance.  Poetry atrophies when it
gets too far from the music."
-Ezra Pound

"An adult is one who has lost the grace, the freshness, the
innocence of the child, who is no longer capable of feeling pure joy, who makes
everything complicated, who spreads suffering everywhere, who is afraid of
being happy, and who, because it is easier to bear, has gone back to
sleep.  The wise man is a happy child."
-Arnaud Desjardins

"Music rots when it gets too far from the dance.  Poetry atrophies
when it gets too far from the music."
-Ezra Pound

No, but I did apparently fall asleep, and have a weird dream that involved
planning a massive up here, a trip to LA, visiting the droid behavior guys,
DJ Amber, some sort of automated warehouse/distribution system and nearly
getting run over by a transport of freight.

I think I better turn this off and sleep in quiet. :)

Ya, do remeber and I miss it. I was fortunate enough to get to play there at least twice but never in that main room. Now that place only has gus bean type related parties along with a few asian promoter hip hop parties. Have not been there since the last decompression party that I believe was there.

No, but I did apparently fall asleep, and have a weird dream that involved
planning a massive up here, a trip to LA, visiting the droid behavior guys,
DJ Amber, some sort of automated warehouse/distribution system and nearly
getting run over by a transport of freight.

I think I better turn this off and sleep in quiet. :)

Subject: [sfraves] bsp: Saturday DAY PARTY @ the Endup w/ Bruno Pronsato, Tanner Ross and more

Not our show, but posting it up for those who may be interested.


Full info here:
http://www.allandbyallo.com/projects/apertura/apertura_H.jpg

Set times:
2:00-3:30 Jaime James (DJ)
3:30-5:00 J Phlip (DJ)
5:00-6:30 Alland Byallo & Clint Stewart (2x4 Decks n FX debut)
6:30-8:30 Tanner Ross (DJ)
8:30-10:00 Bruno Pronsato (live pa)


This should be a hoot!

Bruno kicks ass and Tanner's put out some badass tracks on Dirtybird
and Mothership in the last couple years.

Obviously the rest of the lineup is damn solid as well.

See you there.

Raving on Mars woul dkick ass because of the slightly (but not too much)

Also, FWIW, I recently read a scientist's suggestion that Martian sex would

Not our show, but posting it up for those who may be interested.


Full info here:
http://www.allandbyallo.com/projects/apertura/apertura_H.jpg

Set times:
2:00-3:30 Jaime James (DJ)
3:30-5:00 J Phlip (DJ)
5:00-6:30 Alland Byallo & Clint Stewart (2x4 Decks n FX debut)
6:30-8:30 Tanner Ross (DJ)
8:30-10:00 Bruno Pronsato (live pa)


This should be a hoot!

Bruno kicks ass and Tanner's put out some badass tracks on Dirtybird
and Mothership in the last couple years.

Obviously the rest of the lineup is damn solid as well.

See you there.

Don't forget the heat and hard to breathe aspect, automatic ravelike
conditions.  At least until Arnold ruins it by releasing the oxygen
into the atmosphere and killing all the indiginous martians.

Wow completely awesome. I was at that event. I think in the entire  
history of thump at 550 I think I missed only 2 - 3 of the monthlys.  
They were that good.  Was not the same after the move to DNA...  
although I did have some good times at DNA.

Remember ANALOG? There were a few others that raised the 550 torch...

Hey all - -
Tonight's Radio Integrated will be our last show broadcasting live from the
Bliss Factory in Alameda, before our one month recess. During our break
we're going to be doing a little revamp of Radio Integrated, but we'll be
back in August, bigger, better, and more shiny! Tune in at http://radio
.defsf.com:1200/ tonight from 9pm-1am, or feel free to swing by the Bliss
Factory with some Red Stripe if you know where we're at.  ;)

*Featuring DJs:
Paul Leath (DoBox)  -> **http://www.myspace.com/paulleath :
http://doboxrecordings.com**Paul Leath has been one of the innovators of the
Southbay techno scene for more than a decade. His style is an infusion of
Techno, DubTech, House and Reggae which melds the cool and groovy with
funky, jackin' techno.

DJ STML (DEF, Radio Integrated)
**A native of South Africa now residing in the Bay, STML is one of our
favorite DJs, cohorts and most awesome collaborators. His always varied sets
are definitions of his vast musical knowledge and exquisite taste. From
bangin' London acid to deep and groovy minimal, STML always holds it down
with style.


Don't miss next week's show, our very last one before our break, live from
Faktion, with DJs Toro Toro, Saya, and Disconnect.

Radio Integrated is on the air NOW! We're listening to a few techno tunes
selected by me at the moment, as STML is going to be hitting the decks with
a set of dubby techno once he comes back from a beer run (very important).

Tune in here:  http://radio.defsf.com:1200/

More info below!
Love Chelsea

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Tonight's Radio Integrated will be our last show broadcasting live from the
Bliss Factory in Alameda, before our one month recess. During our break
we're going to be doing a little revamp of Radio Integrated, but we'll be
back in August, bigger, better, and more shiny! Tune in at http://radio
.defsf.com:1200/ tonight from 9pm-1am, or feel free to swing by the Bliss
Factory with some Red Stripe if you know where we're at.  ;)

*Featuring DJs:
Paul Leath (DoBox)  -> **http://www.myspace.com/paulleath :
http://doboxrecordings.com**Paul Leath has been one of the innovators of the
Southbay techno scene for more than a decade. His style is an infusion of
Techno, DubTech, House and Reggae which melds the cool and groovy with
funky, jackin' techno.

DJ STML (DEF, Radio Integrated)
**A native of South Africa now residing in the Bay, STML is one of our
favorite DJs, cohorts and most awesome collaborators. His always varied sets
are definitions of his vast musical knowledge and exquisite taste. From
bangin' London acid to deep and groovy minimal, STML always holds it down
with style.


Don't miss next week's show, our very last one before our break, live from
Faktion, with DJs Toro Toro, Saya, and Disconnect.

1) Fable you rock! Totally cool running into you @ Thievery.

2) Hil's car got broken into outside of Gingerbread. The crackhead got his flyer bag with a ton of my flyers. We found the flyers up the street, but no bag. . . 

3) We go back to Temple only to find my car was broken into. After further investigation, I'm totally relieved- all they got was my jacket. Idiots forgot my backpack, and totally missed my weed.

4) Go back to Gingerbread to see if Hil found his bag. No, but apparently the crackhead came back and threatened to bash some chick over the head with a pipe if she didn't give him the money box. I'm now re-contemplating whether or not armed security is a "bad" thing.

5) On a side note, I met this dude Jason that was putting on a party @ Seri Phi. Totally cool cat! Sorry I missed you there Ben, wanted to surprise ya with some flyers but I couldn't find ya.

That is all, hoping for a mellow night tonight. . .     

Chuck

We were unexpectedly treated to an amazing visuals display right here in our
living room by Heroic Robot, complete with prism glasses - yowza!!

Subject: [sfraves] Two & Four Thanks and Apologies

A big, big, birthday thanks to all of you that came out to Two & Four last night, and an even bigger thanks to those of you who pulled things together to make this happen. It was a hot night in the citaaaaay and I'm sure all of our getting' down heated it up yet another degree or two. ;)



As Chuck mentioned, unfortunately we did get robbed. Four guys off the street came in, hit our door guy and took the cash box. It's really sad when wanting to get your friends and family together for an intimate night of dancing to celebrate your birthday results in a great deal of money lost and a fellow raver getting assaulted. I'm sorry to all of you who had to experience that. For the record, while my empty bank account is definitely feeling the pain, our door guy is mostly okay. He was more shook up by it all than anything else. I'm very thankful that no one else was hurt.

And Chuck, I am very sorry about Hil's and your car. The heat brings out the worst in people sometimes. Best of luck in recovering your things. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

Heart,
Alida

No apology necessary, totally not your guys fault! I feel like an idiot for not mentioning what an incredible job you guys did. M3 and others rocked the joint, sound was excellent, and everyone on staff was f'n awesome.

My armed security comment had nothing to do with your event, and it is I that should be apologizing for not mentioning the above earlier. Much, much props to the party. We had a lot of fun inside!

Subject: [sfraves] WR: Friday Night Adventure

It was kinda hard getting outta the house early 'cause I had sooo many
errands & chores to do... so like I managed to catch the last bus that
went by my house to the main bus stop (The HTC) in Hercules & i ended up
catching the long back roads normal routine bus to BART, but still thought
I had a chance to make it to that Yummy happy hours shindig @ 222 Hyde...

So got to BART, cruised the Freemont trainm transfered, yada yada, got on
the City train @ MAcarthur.. ok... but when teh train hit Mongomery in the
City, train operator announces that everyone had to get out 'cause that
train couldn't travel anymore on that rail & had to reverse to the east
bay route.. Hello 2Day, so I got out & I was kinda urked 'cause it was
already like 9:45 & there was no way I could walk all the way down Market
to Hyde & get a healthy dose of the ear candy, start the evening groovin',
chill with all the Homies time, so I just got a burger @ McD's & took my
time getting to desintation grrove spot 2: Anu!!!

So like 10:30ish I got to Grime City & all i gotta say about the next few
hours there... Holy Fuckin' Shit!!!  So opening set was Jungle, dunno who
it was, but Yum... then ok, there was some dubstep goin' on like after
that, but magically it turned into 2 STEP!!!!  Holy shit... so for the
next hour, I was in HEAVEN!!!  Yeah... it was all 2 Step & Bassline
stuff... so Dope!!!  Then Subtek busted out a dubstep set, but when Jammin
got back on the decks again... lol... she hella played more Bassline yummy
stuff  before she went back into more dubstep, but man,  I was floored
'cause it was just sooo damn Dope to have that much 2 Step to dance to in
a really long time!

The headlining DJ was this dude from NYC, ummm, CAptain Gelatin ummm, no
no no wait... ooooooooh, Secret Agent Gel!!!  But yeah... he was sick.. I
mean.. he mixed everything from Old Skool Hip Hop, to Breaks, & Dubstep,
even some Lionel Richie!  LoL.. no seriously!!  LoL

It was a good crowd too.. everyone there was all about the music & we kept
that dance floor packed the whole night, esp during the 2 Step ;) !  It
was also Dope seein' all my Dub Step Familia there & just kickin' it w/
the crew again!  The funniest part of the night was when we were all
outside kickin' it & this bum wearin' a motorcycle helmet was blowing a
whistle to signal passing cars to go into his parking slot on the street..
at the same time, 2 decked out vans drive by with ThizzLatino Crew all
painted all fancy on the side door, so I yell "Aye, I want me E, where the
fuck's my E ThizzLatino". then like seconds after i yelled that, a cop
pulls over & starts askin' the bum w/ the motorcycle helmet what drugs he
was on, the bum in the helmet starts yelling @ the bum sleeping on the
sidewalk, 8 more cops show up, it was funny as fuck!

After that I was reeeeeally fortunate to get a ride to the Mission to hang
out for a bit w/ my Homies Cris & Laura @ their pad & catch a cab from
there to Gingerbread 'cause it was cheaper.. after an almost drink & a
cuddle w/ 1 of their cats... had an interesting cab there ride & finally,
made it!!!  YAAAAAAAY... it was time to celebrate w/ my Car singing fairy
raver Princess ;)

When i got over there, like i mean.. it took a looooooooooooong looong
time for me to mentally & physically like transition myself to the house
music & enviorment of people.  I mean... like the house crowd has changed
alot in the past couple years & there's alot thugs now, shiney snobby
people, like well.. yeah, & like on the rare occasion i go to an all house
shindig... I just noticed it changed alot...

It was funny, like right when i got there, I saw M3 & he looked at me &
said "What Fuckin' Hell? Where you been stranger?" & we gave each other
this mondo hug.. Lol... then i wished him happy birthday for the past 6
birthdays i missed... I mean.. aside from the vato thugs & snobs, there
were still alota old skool rave troopers there & a whole bunch of Family!

I did dance a lil when M3 spun, he played some r3eally good tunes, oh oh
oh oh oh oh, & Lida had a man w/ a big Penis cake.. that was sweet... by
the last set, Andrew, like it was all about the hardcore ravers left on
the floor & I did feel more comfort FINALLY.. but it wasn't until
literally, the last 15  minutes, when well... me & this Girl, Amazing
dancer, & I were like havin' a step battle kinda 'cause she had some
smooth ass moves & well.. it wasn't really a battle, but we were just
dancing' together & double steppin & triple steppin' to Andrew! :)

I mean.. despite all the yucky bad that happened @ Lida's bday shindig, it
still was a good night for alota people, it served a great need for some
dance floor action, & well.. whatever existhing good energy there was
there!!  Alot people were happy & I saw that & it was a special time. I
mean.. yeah.. there were so many etards & it was fun getting the random
hugs from them ;)  YAAAAY!!!

It was touching, like the moments I got my own personal Lida time w/ her &
it was just Awesome talkin' again with her!  I mean... we always have alot
to talk about & we reminised alot & I had to do my "OH MYGOSH, HELLO 2DAY"
impersonation of her :)

OK Sweetie, Happy Really Hardcore Birthday today!!! {{{HUGZ}}}

YAAAAY.. good times!!!

oooh... but like i'm sad for what happen to ya Hil & Chuckie.. I'm just
glad y'all safe & in 1 piece!

Good to see everyone else from here who i saw!!

1) Fable you rock! Totally cool running into you @ Thievery.

2) Hil's car got broken into outside of Gingerbread. The crackhead got his flyer bag with a ton of my flyers. We found the flyers up the street, but no bag. . . 

3) We go back to Temple only to find my car was broken into. After further investigation, I'm totally relieved- all they got was my jacket. Idiots forgot my backpack, and totally missed my weed.

4) Go back to Gingerbread to see if Hil found his bag. No, but apparently the crackhead came back and threatened to bash some chick over the head with a pipe if she didn't give him the money box. I'm now re-contemplating whether or not armed security is a "bad" thing.

5) On a side note, I met this dude Jason that was putting on a party @ Seri Phi. Totally cool cat! Sorry I missed you there Ben, wanted to surprise ya with some flyers but I couldn't find ya.

That is all, hoping for a mellow night tonight. . .    

Chuck

I think crackheads don't smoke weed, and don't know anyone that does
or will spend money on it... because it seems to have no value to
them. I've heard so many stories of people's cars being broken into in
crack central (tenderloin, mission, hunters point) and the weed being
left behind.

I think crackheads don't smoke weed, and don't know anyone that does
or will spend money on it... because it seems to have no value to
them. I've heard so many stories of people's cars being broken into in
crack central (tenderloin, mission, hunters point) and the weed being
left behind.

That news is terrible. Clearly the Karma Gods took the night off 
because Alida and Chuck are two of the nicest people I know, 
they didn't deserve this.

Ugh.

Alida, the cashbox wasn't full, was it? Were there regular cash 
drops done to avoid that level of cash at the door? I hope so.

Sorry I didn't make it. I was committed doing visuals for a 
candi-rave that got busted, not a good weekend for things, 
apparently.

My heart goes out to Alida, that was a badass party and I wouldn't wish that on anyone. I really shouldn't have whined about Friday, in grand scheme of things it was no big deal, and not my place to be reporting drama. 

I'm going to start posting music & keeping my mouth shut about other matters.

Apologies,

Chuck

 Aww, thanks Terry. I'm sorry you couldn't come. You were missed!

And no, the box wasn't full. Luckily we had just done another drop about twenty minutes earlier, but with the money left in there for change and the steady stream of people coming in, there was still a good chunk of money in there. :(

 Thanks for the sympathy
and compliments, Chuck. I'm so happy that you had a good time
regardless! It seems like everyone was having fun and getting' down and
that's what counts in my book.



And your post wasn't out of line at all, nor did it come across as
whining. There's really no need for apologies. It was a shitty
situation and you and I both needed to vent. ;)





 

Heart,

Alida

Ugh.

Alida, the cashbox wasn't full, was it? Were there regular cash 
drops done to avoid that level of cash at the door? I hope so.

Sorry I didn't make it. I was committed doing visuals for a 
candi-rave that got busted, not a good weekend for things, 
apparently.

The one in oakland near jackson?  that was right across the street
from the afterparty for black market techno and the droid guys came
over too.  Did you drop by after the rave got shutdown?

Man, when did this happen?  I can't recall hearing about gingerbread
getting hit before, always seems like such a safe little oasis in
that neighborhood.  Sorry I didn't get to met you, had planned to come
by after the bliss gathering and did drive by around 4 but was so faded
I had to just go home instead of stopping.

Always the point of having a party, but it's supposed to be an
enjoyable, albeit stressful time for the organizer too.  :-\

Yep, that party.

And no, I didn't drop by across the street. I had a relatively 
massive visuals setup in there that took a few hours to 
dismantle and pack. Went straight home.

 Maybe just before 4am? The party was still hoppin'. You should have stopped by!



And yeah, as far as I know, this was the first time it happened at Gingerbread. I specifically chose to do my party there because of the security aspect. I didn't want to have to worry about any of that shit on my birthday. Uh... whoops? Unfortunately it is in a bad neighborhood to begin with and there was a security lapse that still needs to be sorted out. As I said though, I'm glad it didn't put a damper on the party and everyone else still had an amazing time, it seems. Silver lining...

Heart,
Alida

Damn Chuck sorry to hear you and some of the others on this list were victi=
ms of crimes this weekend! Sounds like the party aspect went down HARD! Alt=
hough it is disturbing because early Friday evening I stopped at a parking =
lot with my friend to blaze a bowl on Harrison before happy hour and saw th=
ese two guys taxing everyone=92s door handles on cars in the parking lot lo=
oking for an opened vehicle. Eventually the two guys saw us and tried to pl=
ay it off and they walked down the street leaving the parking lot.=20
=20
Maybe the heat brought out the worst in people this past weekend=85 The onl=
y thing is you never know anyone can have their car broken into anywhere ev=
en nice rich areas=85However, sometimes it is better to just drive a little=
 longer looking for a more secure spot or just pay money to have your car s=
ecured in a parking lot. My car sticks out like a sore thumb so I hit up th=
e secured parking lots in SF and tend to miss certain events because of it.=
 Not the best for my agenda but when I was 16 back in the day I did not giv=
e a fuck and now I do.
=20
I remember one time walking with peeps on Folsom near the 101 overpass late=
 at night and seeing these three people with one girl crying but obviously =
intoxicated drama crying and her boyfriend consoling her and you could see =
glass everywhere near the passenger side of the car on the street. The girl=
=92s boyfriend asked us if we saw anybody that looked suspicious and we did=
 not and the girl was screaming "these fuckers pissed in my car and now my =
car smells like pee and my things are missing" it was sad. Ever since then =
I became a believer in watching where I put my goods and how much cash I ha=
ve with me on the street.=20
=20
Just like it is cool to feel bad or give a few bucks once in a while to a h=
omeless guy walking by or someone down on their luck but watch out because =
you never know who you are dealing with and what their motives or intention=
s are (e.g., Market Street hustle capital). You never know what that person=
=92s mental capacity is at that time or their mental state.=20
=20
Sad because a lot of thugs/homeless people are mentally ill and need help t=
hat the system can not provide. Believe me if you just walk on by minding y=
our own business and they are trying to engage you in conversation it does =
not make you an evil person for ignoring someone that looks like they may b=
e trouble. Working in the legal field I have read many weird cases that sou=
nd like fantasy! People are people and will do it=85=20
=20
The downside is I feel compelled to avoid having my car broken into so I us=
ually stay away from certain areas in SF when partying. Many undergrounds o=
r parties take place in areas outside my little secure ring of areas of whe=
re I stash my vehicle and take taxi cabs so I tend to stay away. It sucks a=
nd it is not the fault of the people throwing the parties because they can =
not provide absolute security (e.g., can the U.S. secure every neighborhood=
 in Baghdad with billions of $$$ not happening).=20
=20
It is to much to ask any bar owner or promoter of a gig but when I stumbled=
 across the directions to the Gingerbread event I thought about that hood o=
f projects up on the hill that is visible from the 280 on Potrero Hill and =
all the street gangs on that corner of the outer Mission and I was like no =
way my car and a few pot sessions makes it through the night without someon=

off the beaten path in someone else=92s hood seemed a little bit to dangero=
us.

Once again Chuck sorry at least they did not get your bud although I am sur=

Well that 105 degree heat really wrecked me.  I was unprepared.  =20
Unprepared as, well, it doesn't matter.  It was so hot in the house.  =20
But then finally around 7pm I walked down to Sac/West Cliff, where it =20
was 10 degrees cooler than anywhere else in Santa Cruz, probably.  =20
Probably.  Definitely.

And what about the thunderstorms the next day?  I had to retreat up to =20
Libby's BBQ up there this weekend.  LOL!  I forgot to say, she's =20
getting married!

I ended up with this odd phone call last night from Jeff Lawrence of =20
USA Tomorrow Newspaper.  He thought for some reason since I signed up =20
on his website with an email address of usatomorrow at deepfog dot com =20
that somehow I must be the owner of the domain name usatomorrow.com.  =20
He wants to buy the domain name and says the person who owns it has =20
not been getting back to him.  So since the owner, or administrator is =20
addressed in San Francisco, as I found from a simple whois search, I =20
thought I'd put out the call to SFRaves, if anyone knows the person.  =20
Do your $whois search to find out.

Well it's 20 to 9 on the East Coast ... sigh.

I think I'm going to start using SFRaves as a personal diary/emotional =20
soapbox.  I've never done that before and it seems like it might work =20
out pretty good.

Yeah, this morning I read an e-mail that I thought said:

"She GIVES the SUPER HEAD on this project"

It actually read:

"She IS the SPEAR HEAD on this project"

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Jovino returns to An Epiphany Of Sound this Thursday

I'm hoping that you all had a chance to catch Jovino when he made an 
appearance on An Epiphany Of Sound a month ago.  He provided a HUGE 
dose of BIG Electro House sounds for those that tuned in.  It was truly 
impressive, and truly a fantastic way to begin a Thursday morning.

Well, he'll be back again this Thursday.  So if you missed him last 
month, nows your chance to check him out.  And if you caught him last 
month, you know you won't want to sleep on another chance to listen in.

He'll also be appearing in the Castro the weekend for Pink Saturday (in 
front of the Bank of America (aka Bank Of Apartheid).)  So be sure to 
put that on your calendar too.

A little more about Jovino:
Currently, he's the resident for Nerd Salon, and he's been a guest DJ in 
clubs such as The Fencesitter's Ball and most recently F*ck S4it Let's 
Dance (FSLD).  He also has a regular show on Theory Radio 
(http://theoryradio.org/) every Wednesday from 12-noon to 2pm.

Listen in this Thursday on 90.1 FM in the Bay Area, as well as online at 
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu .

P.S., for those of you who are interested in the behind the scenes 
aspects of college radio, KZSU will be holding it's Informational 
Meeting this coming Monday, June 30th.  That's where you can find out 
all about what takes place behind the scenes and see if there might be a 
spot where you would fit in that puzzle.

JUNE 30, 2008
7 PM
In the KZSU NewsRoom

Located in the Basement of Memorial Auditorium

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Jeno has been kind enough to put together an old school set of house and
acid as a special event broadcast for Return 2 Acid (this friday 6.27.08 @
Radiance factory) for Qpod.  Enjoy, and feel free to browse the site and
give the other pods a listen!

http://qpod.org/2008/06/23/qpod-special-event-broadcast--62708-return-2-aci=
d--dj-jeno-2.aspx

For this special event broadcast, we have none other than Jeno from the
infamous Wicked Crew that started full moon madness in the states.  While
Wicked has long been dead, the anarchic nights spent at places like Bonny
Doon Beach still resonate with those who were lucky enough to have partaken
in the Wicked Full Moon experience. Jeno, along with his fellow Wicked
comrades played an integral role in introducing the acid house sounds of th=
e
UK to the West Coast.  Nowdays, you can catch Jeno every Tuesday night on
his weekly internet broadcast on ,
NoisefromtheVoid<http://noisefromthevoid.com/>.
He has also teamed up with Wicked alumni and Grayhound Records label honcho=
,
DJ Garth, for a party called Back 2 Back at 222 Hyde in San Francisco.  The
party features the enlightening sounds of disco-electronica from deep withi=
n
both Jeno's and Garth's record libraries.

Jeno has been kind enough to share a mix of old school acid and rave
classics for this special broadcast on Qpod.  We hope you enjoy the acidy
goodness in your headphones, and one more time with your friends from Qpod
and Acid Totem this friday at Return 2 Acid!

Have a crazy idea, not worth spending money on a bubble machine unless it

 You can rent one at Hertz Party Rental. I'm sure similar places have them, too.

I am always a little amazed at the response that people get when they
hear from Barack. A great man, a wonderful man. But still a man.

Bubble machines aren't that expensive - you can get one for $30 or so at a
party store, so I would just buy one.  My bubble machine is broken, so I'm
bubble-less right now, but it's a nice thing to have around, it adds a
couple fun points and maybe one "WTF?" point to any occasion. I've had my
eye on this bubble machine called the "Jumbubbler", which makes bubbles
bigger than your head.  Sweet!!

And it's battery operated so you can take it everywhere you go!  This
company also makes a bubble machine that puts small bubbles inside the giant
ones.  Can you tell I am a big fan of bubble machines??  ;P

Hey everyone, it looks like the technical issue we were having with our
hosting company has been fixed.  Aside from Jeno's mix, there's 8 other
mixes on the site for you to check out enjoy.  Upcoming podcasts include DJ
Dragonfly (Groove Garden), Mo Corleone, and Ruff Hauser from LA.

Enjoy

Oh noez, I can has the small bubbles inside big one too!  I luvs me
bubble machines.  *sigh* invisible bank account.

Fortunately can't get shipped free and still arrive this week, or I'd
have ordered both and a gallon of bubble solution instead of mailing
this reply. :)

K, so if toys'r'us has something cheap it'll serve for testing this week,
else can go full test for next month.

thanks all!

What a day, what a day.

Today's quote goes with the picture I got with the man himself, quite  
jovial and I believe quite knowledgeable of history.  His new book The  
Fourth Reich just came out yesterday.

So here we have a photo of me with Jim Marrs at Conspiracy Con 2008.   
Anthony J. Hilder is on the right.

Enjoy!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Faktion & THIRSTY 6-27 a tale of two club nights- plus Radio
 Integrated live!

You can call Faktion and Thirsty, two awesome techno clubs virtually 
across the street from each other, a battle royale of techno, tech-house 
and progressive or you can call it a 6th & Mission techno-house club 
love affair... But one thing you can definitely call it is an easy way 
to club hop and get a sense of the reason why techno is surely blowing 
up in SF.

On one side of the street you have Faktion poppin' at ANU, a dope little 
techno club that is slowly gaining a decent following of people (that 
actually aren't *only* DJs and promoters), with an extra dope line up:

Saya:: ] Faktion | BABD [
Toro Toro::  ] Faktion | FnF [
DJ Disconnect:: ] Faktion | DEF| Radio Integrated [

.....and on the other side of the street you have Thirsty at Matador, a 
club with hope, heart some serious skills to back it up, and a damned 
decent talent pool to boot:

Amber:: ] Sister SF | iamthedj.com [
Denise:: ] Mizumo Music | djdenise.com [
Missao:: ] Source4 | Thirsty [
Chel-C Faith LIVE PA:: ] DEF | Radio Integrated [

OK, so you're not in SF? Don't want to come out of your wired cave of 
Internet bliss? No problem! We will just have to bring the party to you. 
Radio Integrated will be broadcasting live from Faktion all night and 
recording all the sets from Thirsty for a later air date. This will be 
your last chance to catch Radio Integrated live for a solid month while 
we prepare to overhaul the http://www.defsf.com site and bring you a 24 
hour broadcast day on DEF's Radio Integrated.

please find details below:
http://www.defsf.com/radiointegrated/integrated or subscribe to the 
links below at the footer of this message.

Tune in to Radio Integrated, broadcasting live from Faktion from 
10pm-2am Pacific this Friday night at::

http://radio.defsf.com:1200

peace, love, respect

Subject: [sfraves] bsp: geekout presentation on algorithmic dance music 7/29

A while ago I came on here bragging about my robot rock:

http://www.vimeo.com/947877
http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/05/archaeopteryx-ambient-evil-robot-army.html

I'll be up in SF on a Tuesday next month explaining how it works to a
meetup of geek musicians and music geeks. It'll be a code- and
tech-centric presentation, and you'll get the most out of it if you
understand some basic technical details of Ruby, MIDI, Reason, Live,
and/or classic old-school step sequencers. (Although if you understand
Python but not Ruby, that's easily close enough to get the gist.)

Was going to do this earlier in June but got sick. Assuming I actually
do it this time, I'll post the details nearer the time of the actual
event.

Subject: [sfraves] ::BSP:: Tonight's the night! Faktion! Thirsty! 6th Street techno block party!


Continuing our tradition of bringing uniquely amazing talent, this month
Faktion brings a rarely heard group of local headliners to the deck.  We've
got Friends&Family favorite TORO TORO this month, along with the Bliss
Factory's legendary DISCONNECT, and a farewell performance from SAYAKA
as she returns to her native Japan for an indefinite hiatus.  We can't
recall if these 3 towers of turntable (and other gear) talent have ever
played together before, and more importantly it's not clear if we'll
ever get the chance to have them together again, so this will be another
party not to miss!  Once again, VJ sensations HEROIC ROBOT return to
transform this from mere club party to the stuff of legends!

To reiterate how techno is now thriving in San Francisco, 6th Street
has become something of a techno block party!  Right across the street
at Matador (formerly Arrow Bar) bangs Thirsty, with a darn talented group
of lovely folks also worth checking out: Amber (SisterSF|iamthedj.com),
Denise(Mizumo Music|djdenise.com), Missao(Source4|Thirsty), and a LIVE
PA from Chel-C Faith(DEF|RadioIntegrated).  Faktion allows full in/out
privs so you can check out multiple parties without figuring out how
to get from one to the next (just watch out for traffic!)

After your pregaming and happy hour prepartying at Killswitch, we'll
see you at 6th Street tonight!


Friday, 27 June 2008

RAY presents: 

F A K T I O N : because san francisco needs another techno cult

Friday, 27 June 2008:
DISCONNECT: DEF/blissfactory [ Oakland ]
TORO TORO: friends&family/faktion [ SF|Oakland ]
and a special farewell performace by
SAYAKA: BABD/Faktion [ Japan|SF ]
Unbelievably Amazing Visuals by HEROIC ROBOT [ SF ]

Last Fridays @ Anu

DISCONNECT: Disconnect is a techno DJ currently based out of Oakland who
spins a dreamy, groovin' laid back style with a dash of progressive and
Neo Detroit thrown in.  He has been throwing underground parties with the
DEF crew since 2003, and is known for his depth and breadth of knowledge
of all things techno.

TORO TORO: Unorthodox, brilliant and just plain kickass, Toro Toro's
original style and track selection shows his industrial influence, yet
remains true to the principles of modern minimal, and the better examples
of electro house.  Known for his versatility in the underground scene,
we're proud to welcome him as a DJ in residence.

and a special farewell performace by
SAYAKA: Sayaka has been a San Francisco resident since 2004, known not only
here but around the world for her consistent mastery of many genres of
electronic music, including the always difficult downtempo.  She hosted her
own weekly techno event at Olive Bar, but decided to focus on her DJing,
spinning melodic techno with flawless track selection and natural progression.
Having been booked repeatedly in New York, Tokyo and other venues around
the world, we wish her the best in her return to Japan.  Don't miss this
last chance to appreciate how easy she makes it look(it really isn't).

Don't forget to read Obama:  The Postmodern Coup, The Making of   
Manchurian Candidate, by Webster Griffin Tarpley, overall very sad  
choices for 2008 Presidential race.  And with Bilderberg Ben Bernanke  
running the money it's doubtful there will be much "change".

Subject: [sfraves] free: Future Music magazine, 13 issues

I'm giving away a year of Future Music magazine, never opened including 
the sample CDs that came with each issue. They are from 2001-2002. If you 
make electronic music you may want this for the CDs alone.

Reply offlist if you want to pick 'em up, I'm in the Castro in SF.

So what if Reagan wins.  Nothing will really change since he and
Carter are both enemies of Islam.

I thought I'd let all my friends on SFR know about a little party that Acid
Totem is throwing on Friday 7/11.  The party is located at an oceanfront
campground with incredible views of the Golden Gate, SF, and the Pacific.
Some of you familiar with the area, can probably figure it out.  We've got
all the campsites reserved, which means PARTAY!  We've also got Mozaic
coming out to play as our special guest, so it should be a good one indeed.
To help cover the costs of the party, we are asking for a menial $8.
Presales can be purchased via paypal at  www.acidtotem.net    Camping is
also available on Thursday night at no extra charge, but there will only be
music on Friday night.  To get all the info, visit our website!

Here's a few teaser pix of the location:

just a word of warning - sometimes the rangers on duty at the GGNRA aren't keen on amplified sound. keep your gear and gennie out of sight until it's time to set them up. i speak from direct experience, btw.

i'm sure you already know to point the sound towards the water... :-)

i always thought that spot would be perfect for a small campout party. be sure to let us all know how it goes!

I've dealt with 'em as well, on more than one occasion.  Assuming everything
goes smoothly, I think it'll all work out fine!

My guess is the general reality these days is d.
;)

The fact that BMOrg had (allegedly) claimed they would do what it took 
to make sure the damages didn't come in at felony levels, and then 
turned around and actually PADDED the receipts they submitted for the 
damages (with travel expenses and other non-related items included) says 
volumes about what the LLC truly focuses on.

Very interesting thread (with eye opening comments) over at 
laughingsquid: 
http://laughingsquid.com/paul-addis-pleads-guilty-to-burning-man-2007-arson-charges/

Personally I'm wondering if it was the (alleged) promise that made him 
not go for an insanity defense (as he's definitely got some 
schizophrenia/et. al issues going on.)

Comments I noted (in no particular order) include these:
