I know I probably shouldn't write this but...
I was in line at a place in Santa Ana California (that' behind the Orange 
curtain in case you didn't know) and there was this S.A.P.D. dude in 
front of me discussing his taxes with another guy in line.  Turns ou 
that this member of Santa Ana's finest was pulling down a cool $80K for 
that year between his regular cop pay, pay for doing traffic school and 
doing speaches on not doing drugs to little kids and God knows what 
else.  I don't think that $80K is shit money.  No one can convince me 
that cops don't get paid.  I'd be happy with $45K.  As long as I had 
enough to make rent, get some macaroni and cheese and buy new records, I 
wouldn't complain! :D
Happy new year and happy holidaze!

Well, it's 5am, just taking another break from Begin Again.
I'll go back in a couple of hours.  Great warehouse party;
lot's of people having fun.  I guess I would have had a better
time if I could've stopped thinking how easy it would be to
die there.

When people go to an illegal warehouse party, they kinda know
that they are taking some risks.  But this $20 advance sale
New Year's Eve party was promoted, perhaps unwittingly, as
something else.  The question to me is not whether people feel
like they got their money's worth, but whether a party like that
should've been thrown in a space like that to begin with.  It may 
have been blast, but it seemed a bit irresponsible to me this time around.

Lee,
I couldn't agree with you more.  We got to the party at about 1am after 
getting our fill of the trance party (more on that later).
After greeting galen at the door who looked worried, (but still managed to 
smile saying hello and being the usual super nice vibey guy), he told us 
it was packed in there and recommended the top or basement floors, which 
he said were the least hot.

As soon as we got to the top of the stairs we were greeted with this wall 
of humidity, and as soon as we stepped through the door I was greeted by 
this big guy passing out and falling in my direction.  After helping him 
break his fall, I started reaching down to check his pulse when some of 
his friends came to help him up as he was reviving and looking embarrassed.
 
Walking into the middle of the room, I saw Lee, and Jeoff W. 
standing on the side with big smiles on their faces.  Also got introduced 
to John L. who also looked to be in good spirits.  Feeling some of the 
positive energy flowing I jumped onto the dance floor and danced for about 
15 min. and realized I was getting pretty hot and could use a rest and a 
refill of the water bottle.  After sliding into the back room, it was nice to 
be greeted by a big fan.  Spent about 5 min back there before I had my fill 
of smoke and decided to head back toward the music.

After coming to a stand still and unable to get thru the thick crowd for 
a little while, the thought flashed thru my mind, what if there was a 
fire now.  Yikes, I thought, and how nice my home enviroment suddenly 
seemed.  With the opportunity to dance at boogie buffet, we decided to 
make more room for others and move on to a safer more comfortable 
enviroment, home.

In spite of the heat and crowdedness, I was a bit amazed as to how nice 
the vibe was, and how well people seemed to be enjoying themselves.  

Back to the trance party review:
Decided to check out the trance party first.  Upon arriving, we were 
impressed with the space, very high ceilings, some nice visuals, beach 
sand floor, and a nice crowd. Enjoyed dancing and hanging out for a 
while. Just around midnight the place got real crowded, with the crowd 
looking more and more filled with the "amatuer night crowd."  

After getting alittle overwhelmed with the crowd and super fast music, 
we decided to check out begin again.  Overall I thought it was a really 
nice party for nye, with a great space.

Fortunately angela and I went out to party with low expectations, being 
prepared to go home early if it was overcrowded.  So happy to fulfill 
society's expectations to be at and party on nye.  

Today looks like a beautiful day and I think I'm going to try and make to 
the boogie buffet thing as I still got some energy in my legs and hope 
there's some of that old boogie buffet majic.

happy new year
:)

Hi everybody!  (said in Grover-like voice)   My name is Renae and i just
wanted to introduce myself to the list.  I've been on for about a month now,
not counting the time i was on last year for a while.  

Since i live in Montreal, you're probably wondering why i'm subbing to this
list.  Whelp, it's because i'm planning on moving to sf in the spring/summer
of 96!   And yes, i am very excited.  

I've been r**ving (on and off) since about 1993.  And for me, it's all about
3 things: the music, the dance and the people.  As far as i'm concerned, you
can't have one without the other, but at the same time, one can't take
precedence over the other.  

Other main concerns right now: getting more people aware about other things.
In other words, incorporating a more holistic experience into the rave
experince.  I'm talking earth concerns, expolitation concerns, etc. etc..
So obviously, san fran is a good choice to learn from how a scene uses other
factors in the rave experience.   Another concern:  hee hee, trading fliers
with someone/s from san fran.  Yes, it's cheesy, but so what!  There's some
really great stuff being put out by flier designers, and i'd like to see
stuff from all over.  So if anyone's interested, email me please!   

Lastly, but not leastly, can anyone tell me if there is a digest command for
the list?   Thanks for hearing me out, and i hope i get to meet some of you
in the near future!   Lurve, Renae

I'll have to agree with Lee - if I had known it was going to be at the space
it was at, I would have thought about other places.  It's not so much the
structural integrity that worried me - although that was a worry, anyone
remember the fire at the underground club in new york 5-7 years ago that
killed a bunch of people? - it was that *so* many people were cramped in
there, and the place really doesn't handle crowds well.  Some places you can
pack and it still feels comfortable - 1015 Folsom for example - but that
space definitely doesn't.  Other strikes: an overdriven sound system
downstairs combined with uninsulated turntables (meaning the needle skipped
about once every two minutes, more often on a sharp-bass track - poor
Ethan!), no real chill space, and no ins/outs.   On the positive side, 
the projections were pretty nice... but ultimately not compelling enough 
to keep me past 1:30 or so, when I left.

Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate sweatbox-style parties.  I can 
appreciate labyrinthian clubs and minimalism.  I loved the parties at the 
Flophouse in Oakland 3-4 years ago.  But they never felt quite as 
oppressively crowded as this place did.  

In the end I rationalized that the $40 Laura and I spent to attend was 
also money for past and future Sunset parties, so in that respect I was 
happy to support Pacific.  But the party wasn't half as entertaining as 
the drive home along Brannan past the fashion center, and then Market 
through Castro.  :)

	Brian

My first _real_ rave.  And I had _a _lot_ of fun, until about 12:30 when it
got WAY to crowded and claustrophobic.  If I had known there were going to be
so many people I would have made more of an effort to get there right when it
started, My friends and I got there around 11:00.  Otherwise, loved the
music, the people, had a really cool time.

please note that i was in no way "dissing" the burning man organization
nor claiming that their job was easy. all i was saying is that it would
be a pity to lose the momentum and the "red carpet" set up by the
nearby towns and police organizations during labor day weekend. if the
BM organization isn't going to do anything out on the playa in '96, i
suggest that there is an opening for a responsible group to do a
"burning rave" in '96. this would include all the setup, portapotties,
fundraising or kickbacks to the local community, cleanup, water, etc
.... and sale of tickets to offset the cost of the endeavor.

i don't quite understand why people were assuming otherwise. and i'm
not claiming i'd be able to organize or setup such an event any better
than the BM org. I program and shmooze for a living; i don't claim to
be an organizational whiz, promotions king, or any of that... If BM '96
doesn't happen, then that will be a shame.

PS: but yes, i found the burning anticlimactic, and found myself having
more fun raving both nights at the wicked camp... the whole burning
man schtick being a cool sideshow and an excellent chillout experience
between raving.

PPS: i'm writing you all from behind the orange curtain where the
weather is warm and the people are (for the most part) annoying, self-
righteous, and vapid. Looking forward to returning to SF soon!

One of my new year's resolutions is that I'm going to purchase a  dual
CD mixer thingamabob soon. I was wondering if anybody has
recommendations for a good place to look at these in SF -- i want to
evaluate a bunch of different brands and figure out which i like the
best. 	I plan to check out my favorite pro-audio store when i get back
to the bay area (Audio Images in SF) but I'm looking for other
recommendations too.

also, if anybody has recommendations for reputable mail-order places,
and particular units that i should look at, please let me know.  i'm
looking for high-end, good sounding, high quality units under $3000.00
and my focus is to find a system that is easier to use than the
braindamaged user interface on  the Denon 2000's that I've tried.

Thanks in advance.

I didn't attend Begin Again but I have a few comments to make.

First off this definitely was not the same Begin Again as last year and 
it was in poor taste for Pacific to use this name seen as how they did 
not even contact the two other principle producers of last years party 
(myself and Dan Mapes).

Second it was somewhat irresponsible to use that space and charge $20. It 
is an okay space when its not too crowded but it is dangerous and highly 
bustable with that many people. Luckily it didn't get busted.

I commend Galen and Pacific for everything they have done for the scene 
but it is not cool to think your the shit  and blow off other people who 
are also important contributers to the scene. It was lucky that  the 
party went off okay , it easily could have  have been a disaster.

It sounds like it was a decent party and I'm glad that people had a good 
time however I hope that rave culture can begin to move forward and 
innovate. So much of it is stale and not really as visionary as one would 
hope it would be. We need more than just self-indulgence and ego 
gratification. 

I still believe that rave has alot to offer but we must confront the 
issues that are holding us back from moving to the next level. I wish 
everyone the best for the new year. I hope to be part of a new phase of 
rave that can truly raise our consciousness.    

Peace,
Ronan

Dear Sweet Ulrike + >!!!!!!

BY YOUR COMMAND FOR EVERYONE ELSE;

                History repeats itself once again, well almost. Well, I
started out earlier in the week with a ticket to Begin Again. The minute I
heard where it was going to be held, & the number of tickets sold, I
thought, wait didn't F&F try and pack 750 people in there and it was soo
overcrowded, dangerously overcrowded. 

        So I went on my merry little way thinking, well I guess I just have
to deal with it considering there's nothing else I'm interested in going to.
Then the Cybertrance party came up, and of course being a the Trance Hound
that I am, I decided to go there instead, and initially told Wayne to sell
my ticket.

        Later, I did some more thinking and thought, well I like what
Pacific does, even though I'm usually way to ate up on Sunday to attend,
and/or do anything short of sex or sleep. Ya no, but a little bust insurance
never hurt, this way I would have a place to go in case the Cybertrance
party got busted.

        Well the Cybertrannce party went off wonderfully, not too crowded,
not too undercrowded, beautiful naked people running around, a hot tub, a
massage therapist(me), a sand covered dance floor(next time Mars tell me & I
won't wear vinily clothes, skin, sand & that material cannot peacfully
coexsist in the same space, mainly my body I'm still itchy) , a minorly
troubled sound system(very early on), a chill area,  great DJ's Mars, Adam,
who was the UK surprize I never did find out, ...etc, killer Goa Trance all
night long(my kinda rave, where House is just something you live in),  lots
o new friendly faces, & a great space which never got too hot because of 30
foot+ ceilings. All in all a great night an the Cybertrance Party.

        So why did history repeat itself, because if you remember last year
I had a ticket to Cruel World, and blew it off because we all know I hate
big, commerialized parties, and went to Begin Again instead, at Bryant
Street, Cyberlabs old HQ(still the best place to throw parties in SF, dats a
fact). The almost part comes in because Pacific is in no way, shape or form,
a commerial party promoter, it was just a big party

        But around 8pm I actually did show up to say high, and to see if
there were lot o  happy faces, and there were at Begin Again, many which I
recognized. 

        Which in the end made me miss Ulrike even more, wah!!!!, see ya
Friday hon    = >, and come back to us safe & happy.

John-

You can get away with being a freak in the city when you're in the city.

If you try to be a freak in the 'burbs, and you're usually getting hassled
in Marin, right?, you're gonna get hassled. They aren't used to your type
there!

I had a pretty great time there, but there was a moment while sitting in the
far back corner of the basement looking up at the floor of the main room and
considering the structural integrity of the ant farm I was in.  My mind
flashed to the million people in there, then to the three foot wide
staircases, then what if a fire broke out here?  Pondered whether I would
die of smoke inhalation or the fire it self.  Then I relaxed and went and
danced.

Ok, enough complaining....

Freaky Chakra kicked ass.  Sorry to the young woman trying to sing and play
flute into the microphone that kept feeding back.  Much to close to the
speaker I guess.  They were totally amazing though.  The guy running all of
the equipment really knew his shit and was well practiced.  Really, really
good live electronic music.  It was really cool because nothing happened or
changed unless he made it happen.  He seemed to have the equip. on pattern
mode and arranged the music how he pleased by swiching from pattern to
pattern.  This is somthing I don't believe I've seen done before, because he
was totally in control.  Many props to FC, and know that I would love to see
them perform again.  This was the highlight of the night for sure.  

Happy 1996!

Rick

	wasnt there one downstairs, and another one upstairs (where no

a nice touch).
	anyways, i had a good time. about needles skipping, it looked 
like something was done to minimize it, i remember seeing lots of

I can't speak to your personal experience, but I too have been pulled over 
several times by the cops while walking down the street.  I answered their 
questions, submitted to searches, gave them any information they asked for, 
and then went on my way.  You didn't mention what kind of treatment you got. 
 All the policemen I dealt with were professional enough, and I didn't feel 
overly threatened.  They were doing their jobs.  No physical or verbal 
abuse.  Of course, I didn't give them a hard time, verbally abuse them, call 
them names, question their authority, refuse information, etc.

Is this an insight into what would go through your mind if you were a cop?  
Cause I can tell you, this would NEVER go through my mind.  Yeah, there are 
assholes everywhere -- Mark Fuhrman is a prime example -- but I too have 
friends that are law enforcement officials and they have told me that, by 
far, the overwhelming majority of cops are decent people, just following the 
dictates of their job.

     Ronan wrote about raves needing to be innovative.  This sounds 
     interesting, but what do people think this means?  I've been going to 
     parties off and on since 1992, and they're all basically the same in a 
     structural sense:  a space, music, visuals, people.  Music gets played 
     all night, continuously mixed.  Occasionally there is a live 
     performance or two.  The only things I've seen change over the years 
     are the music styles (there's more of them now) and the people 
     (there's more of them now).
     
     So, what would people like to see happen?

     Begin Again
     
     Nice large happy party filled with people having fun, except for me, 
     who once got trampled in the Washington DC Metro on 4th of July and so 
     have fears of being in crowds of people I don't know very well.  
     
     The sound coming out of the speakers downstairs was so loud that I 
     could feel the pressure waves hitting me in the chest.  It hurt so I 
     moved to the back of the room, where there was a breeze every time the 
     doorpeople opened the door, the slide-up garage door (in case of fire, 
     earthquake, or the upstairs floor coming down), and some space to move 
     in.  Unfortunately, it was also an echo trap, so everything coming out 
     of the sound system sounded horribly distorted by the time it got to 
     my ears.  I really tried to loosen up and enjoy myself, but after an 
     hour I noticed I kept longing for my sofa and my cat.  Brian and I 
     stuck around until about 1:30, and then decided that we'd gotten our 
     $20 worth (in inflated New Year's party dollars) and went home.
     
     On the up side, there was an impressive DJ/PA list, interesting 
     visuals (but I swear I've seen those Lawnmower Man-ish morphing body 
     loops before), and free water.  A huge number of people were having 
     fun, and nothing disasterous happened.
     
     On a scale of 0-5, I'm giving it a 2, for "worse than average but not 
     *really* bad."  Your mileage may vary, especially if you aren't 
     plagued with fears of going deaf due to distorted sound or of dying in 
     a fire.

I definately thought it was kinda steep in price and WAY TOO MANY TICKETS
were oversold for a venue of that size.   I was led to the conclusion that
a proper number of tickets would be sold for this venue and that they would
get snapped up quickly.  Although they DID get sold out,  but probably because
people had an impression that it would be like last year's party.   I'm not
knocking anything,  I'm just stating some facts,  thats all.

I wouldn't call it highly bustable. Of the several parties held there, F&F
was the only one busted that I'm aware of, and that was somewhat of a
fluke.

As far as the price, the space owners more than tripled their usual fee for
that location, explaining some of the need for higher ticket costs. Even
though I initially got in on the guest list, I ended up spending $20 on an
unused ticket for a friend  and I feel it was worth it, especially
considering all of the free parties Galen's done.

I do think it was overcrowded - 200 fewer people would have been nice - and
there weren't enough staff. When the power kept going out in the basement
it was extremely difficult to find someone who knew where the breaker was
and even then they were to busy working the door to do anything about it. I
wonder how many people knew where there were any additional exits in case a
fire had occured. (which could have been a real possibility considering the
condition of the fuse box there - I accidentally brushed lightly against a
breaker and it sparked and came loose from the box.)

Despite the safety concerns it was an excellent party, and the vibe during
Ethan's set at midnight was exceptional. Even sober, I had a great contact
high from everyone there.

No dis to wicked intended *at all* but we really need to design a
custom Purple People Pusher LIMITER to be inserted into the signal chain
right after the mixer resulting in a 30 db flat cut with another 10 db
notch around 250 hz. That system just routinely destroys my hearing.
argh...

On that note I might add the following: it's *really* hard to tell what the
main system sounds like when you're behind it. If I'm ever playing and it's
hurting your ears, *please* feel free to come tell me and I will happily
turn it down.

happy new year!

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Opps, almost forgot regarding the Cybertrancee thang, if I had to
sum it up in a few words. I have this vision in my head of what the biblical
city of Sodom & Gormora must have been like, the Cybertrance party fit that
vision rather nicely.

        Oh Pete, I took what you said positivity regarding "newbies", but
just for clairity, I would like to say we were all "newbies" once, and that
this is a good thang. 

        New & more interest in the Techno art is a reflection of how
creative, & fresh our scene is. Everyone who does what they do to make our
scene what it is, & keep it going should take great pride in that fact that
they are innovators, creating something new, different & wonderful. Giving
us, as individuals more CHOICES in this life time.

        Some would say this is a bad thing & that it will ruin what ever
community we have together. Well, we never tried to be unpopular, were not
the Cure, and even they failed at doing that. Positive, loving, respectful
people,  & Psychoactive music that makes you & your body smile I hope will
always draw new people closer to it.  Because I fear the day when those
items listed above become unpopular or unfascionalble. 

        One of the main reasons I became attracted to our scene in the first
place was while I was in massage school. I saw a generation of people
touching & hugging each other, people taking about love, respect, tolerence
& responsibility while having a hella good time. Despite the use of the
"love drug" carried these beliefs out & touched the world with them. I was
just totally compelled to support & be a part of this. Hell, I think, there
would be something wrong with you if you weren't draw to some of the truely
positive things our scene promises and delievers.

        I personally have the attention span of 3 year old, & would be
really unhappy if I had to live with Rock & Roll for the rest of my life.
Though R&R are my roots & I still like the new stuff that's coming out, I
spend my CD money on Techno related items. In fact the more trance CD's I
get, the less of the R&R stuff I play.

        Right now our scene is wonderful, it has it's problems just like
everything else in life. Ya know there may become a time somewhere in the
future when I will take a look at our scene, and not be able to recogize it.
It is then, that I hope the restless & resilent creative force of this grid
we call Earth provides us with yet something wonderfully positve, new &
different. Once again taking some of us by the hand to yet another special
place. Look for me there and that's where you will find me.

Yes, it was overcrowded. Yes, I thought about the dangers. Yes, there
were even holes in thin plywood in the main floor where you could see
right through to the basement. Yes, there were floods from the
bathrooms, Yes, It was fantastic!

I got there at 11:50, said Yeaaa, etc. Checked out the whole place,
and settled into one amazingly wonderful set by Ethan. Thank You tons
Mr. Ethan for setting my evening up just right. I was soooo happy that
you were there at that time. It was total bliss. 

The best part of the party for me was that throughout the evening, the
music on all three levels was really interesting. Everyone was playing
stuff that I thought was very innovative. I havn't been to a party
that was this interesting musically.

I heard two DJs in the basement play some very ambient like trip-hop
stuff that fit right in with the cold concrete and the dark chill. The
stuff played on the top floor was very slow and bizare sometimes. I
was always suprised by what the DJs were doing. Very groovy, very
refreshing. Stuff I've never heard before on the middle floor too. 

I'm a musician so I'm always looking for new ideas musically. I was
very touched and inspired by what I heard at begin again. Thanks to
all involved.

Well, I knew it was a long shot, but I had to give it a try.  The
Deadhead-oriented party that Bryce and I played at on Sunday turned
out to be in a very nice place (maybe too nice), the crowd even older
and less energetic than I expected, and the sound crew we were working
alongside (with one important exception) infected with typical rockist
uncooperative attitude.  We got to play about an hour and a quarter
all told, and when the band (rightfully, since it was really their gig)
announced they were going to do a *third* set at 2 am, and the sound
dude had plugged in a piss-poor Dead tape right when Bryce was about
to drop Aretha on the assembled (and we had far better Dead tapes
on hand if that was desired), we looked at each other and said,
"our services are no longer required" and split early.  So it was
a nearly total waste of time.

Except for the wonderful sunset we saw crossing the Golden Gate bridge
on the way up, with the shining city off behind us to the right and the
sky clear to the horizon.

I still think it's possible to mix regular live bands with DJing, but
it has to be *just so*.  After all, Paul Oakenfold has been playing
rock concerts for years, all the way up to U2-sized.  

The party organizer liked it when I played the downtempo mix of Towa
Tei's "Technova," and Bryce played "I'll Tumble 4 Ya," and I even did
a couple of house tracks, but it just wasn't gonna happen.  

No matter . . . look to the future!

Well, the sound was contained pretty well but there was a fire station
*right* accross the street.  I was kinda surprised they didn't stumble
upon it. 

Good crowd, good vibe, good music, but it's hard to have too much fun in
those kind of conditions.  But I agree, 200 less tickets sold would have
made it a much more comfortable and enjoyable party. 

We stopped by Stompy a couple times the next afternoon, nice place to
unwind but I wasn't into the music that much, a little too slow and not
stompy enough.  I was hoping to catch Mark Farina, no such luck.  Anyone
know when he went on? 

Not a very memorable new years but who cares? It's just another day...

Despite my safety concerns I had a pretty good time at Begin Again while
was there.  I helped Daum (freaky chakra) with his sound check, which
delayed things in the main room by almost an hour.  Loren's set started
things off nicely with some house and light trance.  There was some tasty   
hip-hoppy stuff going on in the basement - who was the first DJ down there?
Things got serious in the main room when Ethan took the helm. One song 
early in his set had a kind of electric feedback guitar sound that cut
through me and caused the hairs on my neck stand up.  Wow! The ear facing 
the speaker thanks Laura for the tissue paper.

By 12, the place was packed. I wandered, navigating through writhing flesh, 
bumping into an assortment of familiar faces.  Pleasant surprise to find 
J.S. Lee taking it in (John, did I smell ok?).  A little after 1 I 
decided to take a break.  Driving home was an adventure: from 1 to 5am
many of the SOMA interections switch to blinking yellow lights, i.e. 
total chaos.  You would think that some genius would figure out that
on New Year's Eve drivers might need a little more guidance.

I returned at 4 figuring that things would have started to thin out.
Wrong.  The main floor was twitching to hard techno from Jon Williams.
The music was funkier upstairs, and I danced there a little until I felt
the floor move in a way that I hadn't felt since the 7.? earthquake.
On my way out, I saw Galen fidgeting by the door.  Geoff and
I assured him that Markie would indeed show up.

I drove home again.  Had a pleasant bathroom experience (the line at
Begin Again had been about 20 bladders deep when I checked.)  Got bored,
went back at around 6.  Things were much better now.  Caught the last
.5 of Markie's set - he looked tired, but the music was mostly great.
Now with enough room I was finally able to trance out.  Galen finished
up with a decent 2hour 15 minute set that was a bit longer than it needed
to be.  The upstairs and basement had been shut down for a while, and
the various crews where packing shit away.  From 8:15 to 9 the main 
lights would occasionally blink on&off as if someone was trying to say 
"Galen, enough already."

So all-in-all, a crazy fun/weird night.  Not especially magical, but
I wasn't expecting it to be.  Pacific dipped deep into the karma well
for this one and I'm glad it went off successfully.

That was Monty, bringing back some of the old skool.

     Went to Begin Again after hearing so much about last year's party and 
     knowing what Pacific has delivered w/Sunsets.  Like others, I don't 
     mind supporting them after all they've given to us.  Liked the overall 
     vibe and people (especially the young man in the yellow Adidas sweat 
     suit...he just shined w/energy and pure light :)  Didn't dance as much 
     as I wanted to due to a few commitments but had a good time.  I think 
     you've heard all the rest from the other reviews re:  crowded dance 
     floor, hazardous numbers, etc.  This was my first time at this venue 
     and personally, it leaves alot to be desired but Pacific did the best 
     they could and I think alot of people left happy.
     
     Met a few sfravers there including some new ones.  Hi Colin and John!  
     It's funny how I don't even wear my sfrave badge.  Perhaps I don't 
     want to appear elitest or something...but the reality is that when I'm 
     hot and sweaty, I really don't like to be encumbered by jewelery and 
     that includes something around my neck.
     
     After grabbing a view from Twin Peaks w/the sunrise and crashing at a 
     friends place, I went to help another friend serve food at Boogie 
     Buffet.  Perhaps I was just there too early (they opened at least an 
     hour late) but when I left (around 1:30ish), from what I saw, the 
     players were just beginning to come out and hopefully it went off.  
     Gawd, there were so many fashion plates, I forgot how trendy and harsh 
     some people can be.  My brother calls my "style of fun" "too much 
     hippie love"!  That was reinforced by a German bloke who asked me that 
     morning if I was a hippie back in the ol' days...I knew I was wrecked 
     but did I look that old! So someone out there who went later on, gimme 
     a report and tell me how it was.
     
     Diane

The musical diversity at Begin Again kept me there much longer than I would
have considering the overcrowding, lack of oxygen, and heat. ALSO it is just
plain criminal to have one bathroom and a NO IN/OUT policy (unless you were a
privelaged "friend"). I finally left when I just plain couldn't hold it
anymore! :(

But enough bitching. Me and my friends had a great time and the physical
set-up was the best I've seen for that space. Visuals were better than ever
and as diverse as the music.

I was very impressed with the musical diversity and spent a good amount of
time on each floor. I had to really twist some arms of friends to go to this
party because some of them have complained that they can only take about an
hour or two of the "same ol repetitive stuff". Even they were impressed at
the amount of good new, and unusual music this party. Hopefully this
diversity on new years is a good sign of the direction some parties will
take. It was nice to hear some slower Trip/dub on one of the Main floors! 

Favorite DJ of the evening - Felix!

DJ that made me dance the hardest - Ethan...

Thanks to everyone involved, we all had a great time...

peace,
martin

I saw mention of Boogie Buffet on this list -- is it back in action
or was that a new years day special?

Also, where is that "other" full moon rave going to happen? I may be
driving back from So-Cal on fryday night so perhaps I can catch it on
the way back to SF...

PS: Many thanks to all who responded about the CD DJ mixer thingies!

What we did on New Year's Eve- from the New Moon


	The dilemna of New Year's Eve for a raver:  whether to go out and play 
all night, or stay at home and drink champagne with your friends.  Hmmm.

It was the week before New Year's Eve, and we had three options for raves 
that night:  a trance party given by F8 and collaborators, Pacific's 
Begin Again or the Ameba/Raindance party down in Santa Cruz.

After much discussion, we decided to go to Santa Cruz.  Begin Again would 
have awesome music, with the Gardening Club, Felix, Scott and Gavin 
Hardkiss, Pacific djs Galen and friends.  But the space- the Acme 
Gallery- is too small for a full-on rave, and we wanted to bring the New 
Moon altar.  That space is a major firetrap and we didn't like the 
entry price of $20.  Someone said the guy that was renting it out is "too 
fuckin' greedy" or something like that.  Because no-one could believe 
Galen would charge $20 for that firetrap without good reason...such as 
the Acme guys were gouging him.  

After a visit to Frequency8, we clued in to the fact that 
their party was for the dedicated SF trance crowd and we might have a 
hard time getting in.  "Get there at 8," Mars advised.  But since when 
can a group as big as ours manage to get anywhere THAT early?  So Santa 
Cruz it was.  Plus, it was a donation-only party, and that usually means 
a more mixed crowd than the average rave.

We had no idea what to expect from the Santa Cruz Ameba/Raindance rave.  
We knew Tracy would play, but we'd never heard of the other dj's.  We'd 
never heard of the space either.  Maybe I'm nuts, but a key ingredient of 
raving is NOT  knowing what to expect beforehand.  So the fact that would 
be something DIFFERENT made me want to go.

We loaded up our altar boxes and headed for Santa Cruz at 9.  We had a 
little trouble finding the place, but when we did, we were delighted.  It 
was at the old train station in SC, which is now called Jose's Cantina.  
It was a huge space!  There were crazy corridors leading everywhere, with 
plenty of rooms where we could build the altar and establish an 
ambient/chill out zone.  We had been talking about the Winchester 
mystery house 
on the ride down, and lo- we found it.  The place was like a labyrinth, 
with chandeliers.  Cool.

We brought in the altar boxes- full of candles, flowers, Christmas tree 
lights, figurines, sparkly doodads, etc., and started setting it up.  As 
soon as we began, people started coming to see what we were doing.

No jaded SF nightclubbers were they!  They right away started grabbing 
stuff out of boxes and helped create a beautiful altar.  There were even a 
couple of children who immediately grasped the concept.  Michelle 
commented:  "I love how these sacred spaces get created!" while gazing 
happily at what started out as a bar table and what ended up as a 
shrine.  To what?  Who knows.  Maybe the party itself.   But  every little 
object was placed just so and there was a curtain of christmas tree 
lights hanging over it.  And lots of candles, as usual.  That altar 
looks different each time.    

The party wasn't too crowded, but it was full.  Yes, the perfect 
amount of human bodies were there.

The nicest surprize was that people knew what to do with all the altar 
stuff.  There were lots of Deadheads 
there, who had built shrines on Haight Street when Jerry Garcia died.  
They automatically knew what we were about.  Another nice surprize was that 
Sid, Josh & Angela, who had been to New Moon parties many times, were 
also there and helped guide the altar's development.

The party lasted all night.  When we left, shortly after dawn, a 
Raindance dj was 
still playing to an exhausted, enthusiastic dance floor.  For all I know, 
they're still going.  Mark was cleaning up, looking very happy.  Tracy 
had played a excellent house set in front of a devoted crowd.  Batya- 
roving jewelry maker- had sold some pieces.  The Raindance crew were 
pleased with their success and had taped the whole night of music- They 
were mostly Deadheads who perhaps are looking to "the rave" to continue
their musical journey.  It was an example of ravers and Deadheads getting
together to party all night.  The two "scenes" meshed perfectly, we thought.

Hopefully, these guys will throw some more parties at this same spot- if 
they do, you  should check it out because it is a great place to spend all 
night..and the beach is just around the corner for when the sun comes up.
  

-Ann, Gregg, Batya, Michelle, Ingrid, Paul, Josh, Jen

Yes, Yes Yes.
This was the Boogie Buffet that we all know love and remember,
Shades and sunglasses in full effect to protect the guilty :)
Full-on, no sell-out, craker-jackin only for the hard-core, if you can't
handle your substances stay the fuck off the dance-floor (Can I git
a witness JSL :).

It wasd truely amazing, it was like I had been transportd back two
years or more to the days when Boogie Buffet was THE place to be
after a night of ravin.  All the usual suspects were there, club-kids
in the latest (to the nano-second fashion statement) tired ol' ravers
like myself :), glamorous stripper posses', Amature's who were tough
enough to make it through the night. 

I got there most likely right as you were leaving Diane, but I was the
first one to get a plate of Eddie's wonderful food, it was just what I
needed at the momnet and I chowed down with abandon, I had gone home
from Begin Again around 7:30, since I am now a proud resident of
San Francisco (as of Jan 1) I can go home between parties, so I went home
took a nap and got to Boogie Buffett, around 2:00.  Harry Who? was cutting
it up on the decks, nice blend of trip-hop (or down-tempo, which ever you
prefer), acid jazz and oldies, lots of high people dancing in the 
sunlight streaming through the sky-lights.

In the gold room, someone was playing hard-trance for those who hadden't
had enough yet.  Truely a legendary Boogie and a great way to set off
the new year, I left early (around 6:00) as I was leaving I noticed
a rather stylishly dressed young lady in her white thigh-hi tights and
red patent-plastic skirt, passed out and apparently asleep, her feet 
literally "to the curb" and her head resting in the lap of a friend,

ahhh San Francisco!

There are three toilets in that space that I know of (two downstairs next
to each other and one upstairs) but that's still not enough for a party of
that size.

New Years, a time of forgetting a thousand lost regrets...

OK, I don't really like NYE that much, a holiday created with Roman
oppression, though they did know how to party.  It's all those tuxedos
and popping champagne bottles and Guy Lombardo's rockin eve and Times
Square dropping the ball.

But the vibe is almost always good when it doesn't get ugly.  No moody
people on New Years.

With a generous invite from Tom & Stacey, I headed for Origin.  A last
minute change in venue:  the Boatyard, scene of an earlier XNTRK
party.  Great location with lots of boats and a boatramp.  The sound
system was in a shed which wasn't quite large enough.  A tarp
enlarging the dance floor flew away spectacularly in a sudden gust.
No matter;  it was a beautiful, warm night.  Spotlights all over town
made a light show rivaling the Northern Lights.  The sound wasn't too
bad outside;  I would have been happy if the  party was all outside.
The change in venue left the promoters pottyless.  A long line for the
bathroom.  Markie was late here, too.  Poor Matthew was left playing
"I Feel Love" waiting for him to show up.  Gotta love Markie, though,
he played the percussive house with those fussy cowbell sounds that we
know so well.  Carlos played with his usual verve next.  I spotted the
cops coming in;  I waited, the music continued.  What's going on I
wondered...  Back on the dance floor, the policemen were playing  a
drum set and blowing their whistles!  Priceless, I still don't believe
it.  Jaw agape, I returned to the open-air hearth that was providing
warmth to the jacketless.  The party went on as Garth and his
enteurage breezed in for an enjoyable set.  

Feeling restless, I forgoed what was sure to be an amazing dawn on the
bay to sneak into Begin Again.  Though it was now 6, it was still very
crowded.  I am always a little frightened of this place, but if  I'm
gonna go, this would be my ideal way :).  Great vibe but the usual
problems as discussed elsewhere that have me burnt out on Acme.

I went home for 40 winks and woke up quite hungry so I headed out to
Stompy.  I was happy to see such a great vibe in the daytime, like
sunset or a GG park party except more glamorous.  The food included a
breakfast of granola and fruit;  lunch was a vegan carribean stew.  I
had a great time but left before dark because I knew my dog was
counting on me to take her for a walk on such a beautiful day.
Overall I did have a great time, and I hope everyone has a great 1996!

  I called them and got a recording that said they've gone out of 
business, but that their San Jose store continues. I didn't even know 
they had a San Jose store -- but call Star for their recorded message.

i haven't checked any postings yet to see what anybody might be saying about
the new year's eve party i threw - i want to explain what happened before i
dare look.

a)  what most people didn't know is that my friend (ford) asked me to throw a
new year's eve party for him and his friends at his warehouse.  this was
supposed to be an invite only affair - not some public rave.  unfortunately
this was not communicated properly by me to the people who helped out.

b)  we expected 150-250 people (maximum).  we guesstimate that 850-1000
showed up.  we ended up letting approximately 500-600 of those people in.  i
have since found out that various "party lines" had our address posted.
 while watching the door i heard comments that "there is plenty of room to
let people in!" yet i had several d.j.s and warehouse residents come up to me
and ask me to stop letting people in - there was no more room.

c)  if the 150-250 people that we expected had been the only ones to show up
the single bathroom and cups for water would have been adequate.  we told
people that we invited that there would be no bottled water and to bring
their own.  we put several hundred cups for water by the bathroom so that
people could just fill them up at the tap.

d)  i am truly sorry that so many people had to be turned away, but this was
a private-type party that got out of hand.  as i said before there was
miscommunication between me and some of the other people that were
involved...and none of us had any idea that it was going to turn into such a
massive event.

e)  a.d. will not be doing another party for at least a month because i am
waiting for my friend to bring his freshly built 17,000 watt sound system out
here.  with this system and my friends that have warehouses i am going to
start doing monthly parties.  thanks to everybody for your love, support and
understanding.  

you can reach me personally at Ytima@aol.com...amity

I've had police experiences that range from skateboarding in the "wrong"
place to being woken up with a cop pointing a .45 in my face and I will
vouch for this perspective. If you've got nothing to hide, you've got
nothing to worry about. If you live in a neighborhood that tends to require
extra law enforcement, be aware that you may be treated like a common
criminal when you aren't, because most of the people they have to deal with
there are.

Cops are the people who pick up the pieces when people in society decide to
act really shitty towards each other. I don't think I could put up with it
for 40-60 hours a week, myself.

eh

Hmmm, and when is a warehouse NOT a firetrap?  When it has permits issued
by the Fire Dept., Health Dept., Etc.  I dunno if any warehouse party in SF
(i.e. underground), could really be called safe.  I have yet to see any
fire extinguishers at any rave I've gone to, usually 1 exit (the others are
either chained or blocked), and there is usually only one bathroom.  Begin
Again was was no exception.  The back of Townsend is often overcrowded
(until 4), inadequate ventillation (unless someone brings fans), and two
bathrooms for hundreds of beer/booze/water drinking folx.  I don't think
you can have an underground party in SF without some safety problems.  Even
large warehouses have occupancies much less than what you would think for
their size (legally that is).

As for greed...well, it's New Years.  Unless you have some really righteous
DJ's and sound people, you are going to be charged a premium.  And to be
honest, I heard that they kept the DJ fees @ Begin Again very reasonable,
as New Years goes.  With that in mind however, the DJ's wanted to get paid
a certain amount, and I don't see why someone should get paid upwards of
$200 and hour, whereas if I have a space i should charge less than anyone
else.  No greeed is not the sole dominion of the person who has the space,
but during the first, it infects all mechanisms of parties in the city.  I
guess the freebie in SC was the way to go if you wanted to avoid all of the
money aspect of parties.

Peace & Happy New Year,
John

Begin again was a fine party, although I really didn't care for the music
that much in the hard ass 130+ acid trance room.  Ethan did a good job,
however, and Scott Hardkiss rocked it as well.  I went, I think, upstairs
to the groove room where LaRon was playing some really cool trip-Hop,
Hip-Hop beats that got the bodies moving.  I spent an hour or so there.
Met Lee (who smelled fine BTW), and Diane T. who was working up a sweat,
but both kept the funk in check!

I had to get home and take care of some biz, like my family, and hang with
them for a while before going to Stompy Boggie CrackerJack Cafe.

I came, I saw, I cracked!  I had a good time, all be told, and have found
several 12 step programs that see me as a '96 candidate for poster child.
Yes, it was all that, the vibe was great, the people were fun, and it was
like the old days...old Roman Days I that is!  I do love SF!

Oh yeah, shouts to Alan (dude, I loved those glasses and that funky doo, &

I'll talk to Charlotte and see what happened.  But, you knew the writing
was on the wall.  I am suprised they lasted as long as they did.  No
listening booths (in the early days you had to put up with really snotty
people who would, grudgingly play a 12" for you), moved location from the
fron of Hayes, to the alley (really inaccessible & a scary location where
hookers & pimps ply their trade).  Couple that with the plethora of easily
acessible stores, with listening booths, and friendly staff (Charlotte
is/was the best thing that happened to Star), it was only a matter of time
before they shut thier doors to the dance music community.  Oh well, show
tunes, and opera pieces never die; they just move to a very gaudy Hayes St.
location....;(

At least there's still:Soundworks, Solid Grooves, BPM, Tweekin, Primal, and
varous other used/new records stores to get a vinyl fix.

I have never been anything but 100% courteous and professional in my dealings
with police, and I say this with absolutely no sarcasm.  Didn't seem to keep 
them from their "investigation", although it may have saved me from spending
a night in jail...I don't think it a good bargain to find out.  The following
comment is what disturbs me:

> If you've got nothing to hide, you've got
> nothing to worry about. 

And who gets to define "nothing to hide"?  _They_ do, which includes the
arresting officer and the local/state/federal government.  At best, you have
tyranny of the majority.  At worst, you have Nazi Germany...instead of looking
for drugs or some shit, they look for your drivers license, aka identity
papers, which by the way they only issue you if you're of the right skin color/
national background/etc.  Far-fetched?  Several Congresscritters have tried to
mandate national AIDS testing and internment of those who test positive.

Plus, did you know that the officer that stops and questions you can legally
take all your money if s/he _suspects_ that you _might_ be a drug dealer?
And that you have to sue in civil court (no court-appointed attorneys here)
to get it back?  Can you say "guilty until proven innocent"?  And, furthermore,
that the local PD gets to keep the bulk of that money?  Generally this only
happens to people who don't speak English well and are unlikely to make a
stink.  How do you think San Jose can afford so many cops, and so many shiny
new cop cruisers?  The Merc had a great series of articles about the civil
forfeiture laws about a year ago -- it's scary shit.

Do you see why I don't believe _anyone_ should have this power?  If you could
shake down people for their cash just about anytime, wouldn't it be tempting?
Would the average person be able to resist this temptation, especially since
(as has been pointed out) cops are not especially highly paid?

This is horseshit.  If a _real_ crime is being committed, arrest someone.
Otherwise, they have nothing to go on besides looks -- "that guy _looks_
like a criminal according to my set of prejudices".  Sadly, this behavior
can be incorrectly reinforced, because of any random sampling of the population
you pick up, _some_ of them will have, say, dope on them.  Let's say you 
picked Mexicans as your target group.  Most are clean, a few have some drugs.
It's easy to say then "See, Mexicans are all fuckin' dopers, man!  Stop 
enough and you'll find someone holding."  The trouble with this logic is
that since you're no longer stopping anyone else (since you decided that
the Mexicans were it) you have nothing to compare this distribution against,
and even if the population at large holds _more_ dope on average it will look
to you like you've discovered some statistical truth, since stopping the
Mexicans always works.  You might as well have stopped all people with blue
eyes, all people apparently under 23, or all left-handers.

Since we have decided to live in such a way that cops are required (over-
crowding, isolation from our neighbors and community, motor vehicle access
pre-empting human access such that high-speed getaways from crime scenes
are trivial) -- in short, abdicating responsibility for our own welfare and 
that of our community, we require cops.

I appreciate those cops that have a genuine concern for the community, but I
also believe that they will always be outnumbered by those with a chip on
their shoulder.  Why?  The motivation to abuse power for selfish reasons
is always (over time) stronger than the motivation to use it wisely so
others won't abuse it.  I mentioned this in my last letter -- the first
is reinforced every time you mess with someone (under your control, can
be anytime), the second is only reinforced when you do a Good Thing and
someone thanks you for it (not under your control).

Think of how often the undergrounds thrown by people on this list require
law enforcement to keep people in line.  Never?  Why?  Because people have
taken responsibility for making sure the event goes off safely by creating
an environment where safety and fun, instead of $, are the primary concerns.
(Example: not serving alcohol, which makes you a lot of money but makes
many people act ugly to each other.)

	They have a date up for Burning Man 96 on their web site. Whether 
they are going to "allow" a rave camp this year was a topic of 
speculation since some of the people in main camp felt we decreased the 
importance of the burning of the man and that we just plain annoying with 
our music that would not stop (except for those nice little rain 
showers)... But I doubt they would really axe the rave camp - that seems 
to be against the spirit of burning man. And if they did? We would 
probably just move farther away next year - though I don't know what we 
would do about port-a-potties...

dont know how to start this off but ill just begin......
went to the gathering and had a good time ...wow..so big but i did not 
have many problems with it..did not see any fights and kept moving from 
room to room to get my fill of all the djs. it just seems that 
you cannot have a very tight vibe when there are so many people...especially 
liked the guy from chicago.....forget his name now...

got one of the last tickets for begin again cause i heard about it so 
late and procrastinated.......
FULL CIRCLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i started raving NYE last year and had to go to a good party in the city 
for this NYE........
i had never been to the acme before and arrived at about 11:15.....not 
too many people but it got packed when ethan came on...he got me going..
(thanks ethan..i said hello to you and thanked you..i had a whistle and 
wore a green disco (crisco) shirt) and that was it!!!!!!!!!!!!
i was gone in another world until about 6:30 that morning..............

hello to all the sfravers i met and everyone else...i rEally EnjoyEd mysElf

...it seemed that no one knew about the two small unlit bathrooms on the 
main floor....i just used a lighter to see and it worked fine all 
night...i think it would have cut down the line if all the guys (or brave 
women) had used them.............they even had ALOT of toilet paper in them.
yes it did seem alittle sketchy at first when i saw that it could 
have easily been busted....i saw cops hanging out on the front part of 
the building before i went inside......some of the spontaneousness (sp?) 
and fear of problems (i.e. fire, collapsing floors, needle bouncing (sorry 
ethan) and such make the vibe stronger for it is the energy of everyone 
working together to get through the probelms that makes such parties "go 
off".
dont get me wrong...im not advocating an unsafe place but i think some 
factors such as the ones ive listed above help make a certain vibe....

i really really really enjoyed the variety of music that was spun..it was 
great to hear something besides the regular stuff.....

i think ive said enough..............
dimitri
ps i hope no one was disturbed by my whistling.............

Charlotte wasn't the only thing Star Alley had going, Susan was their
techno/whatever buyer and backroom counter person for quite a while
and I got many good tracks there while they were around.  They did
have these ancient QSC studio turntables, very similar to what I used
in college radio in (gulp) 1977.  But DJ-friendly?  Nah.  Attitude City
is more like it, 'cept when Charlotte or Susan were around.

As for vinyl, don't forget Ameba, F8 and the newest find, Open Mind
on Divis right down from Haight.  Rumor is someone snagged an original
copy of a Cybotron 12 there recently for cheep, and it's no rumor at
all that I got my copy of 'Hey Rocky' by Boris Badenough there (and
played part of it at the August F&F) for all of $4.  Somehow old Detroit
and Chicago stuff is showing up regularly at Open Mind.  Are there any
stories anyone isn't telling us?  Anyway, it's worth the trip.

	You're right here... The ritual of the man was one of the only 
times of the whole weekend where I could only be a spectator. Maybe that 
is because it has grown too quickly and the ritual of the Burn needs to 
grow with it.

	All this talk of responsibility on the playa brings something a 
question to mind... Why is the playa different than ANY other outdoor 
space we use (well, besides it is a bitmore windy and you cannot dig a 
hole to poop in)? Why are any of the beaches or woods ok to litter in or 
drop cigarette butts but the playa is scarced? I think in any party, the 
partier has the responsibility to keep track of their trash - which means 
water bottles, cigarette butts, glitter, candy wrappers.... (esp. 
cigarette butts which fit so nicely in the little change pocket in your 
jeans if you wear jeans)... So, please son't complain about the playa, 
unless you keep those habits up throughout your life as much as possible...

I agree with Dave completely....and I've noticed this problem at Sunset 
parties.  This is a free party in an outdoor setting and I felt like it 
was *EVERYONE'S* responsibility to keep their trash picked up.  How 
someone could throw their garbage on the ground without thought as to who 
would be picking it up was beond me.  I've wondered if the Pacific crew 
have thought of this as a lack of appreciation - I know I would have if I 
extended myself only to have to pick up people's shit.

love,
Amy

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        The bottom line is that if your white, educated, have some money(not
much though) & the crime is either non-violent, and/or white collar; you
will get off with a light sentance if any. Ok, why is this so, I'm just
going to offer a few reason's.

        Statistically the group of people I mentioned above usually have but
just one run in with the law and that experience is enough to convince them
to go straight for at least a few years, or do gray area crimes; crimes that
they're required to prove intention(very to extremely difficult to prove),
or do different non-violent white collar stuff; so that your not being
convicted of the same thing. If you thing there is a formula here, your
right, there is.

        Not that I've ever none anything like this, but I know people that
have, and still are with no end in sight. There are holes in the system, and
you just have be smart enough to see them, experiment a lot, and have a
little money to start with.

        Where blacks & hispanics, & other groups continue to do the same
violent thing, like it's a matter of personal pride or saving face, it's
sooo stupid. Also, & but it's proabily the only thing  that they can see, or
that's available to them.

        Anyone white or black who picks up a weapon & commits a violent
crime is a MACHO DUMB ASS, there's no money in it, and more than adequate
protect against such crimes. There are penty of gray area crimes, and ways
to scam money in America, that don't require you taking money from little
people, commiting violent crimes, and/or getting caught.

        There are penty of people in America that are extracting money from
the system be it corporate or government that you never hear about, because
they never get caught. Though techology is making harder to do these things
until one day the hackers will catch up.

        We as American's are kinda hippocritical of crime. Here we were a
legal English colony, and we all decided that we didn't want to be taxed by
them so we violently removed ourselves from their control. We where also the
worlds greatest smugglers at the point in history. We took advanage of a
large coast line, our close geographic proximity to the west indies, and
sent our own PIRATE ships down there to get the goods, and /or raid/destory
British ships, and we talk about law & order, it just makes me laugh.

Speak for yourself. Your whole argument reads to me something like trying to
find a way to walk down the street with bags of speed taped to your forehead.

Props to you, though, for recognizing and listing many of the different ways
that the people in this country are going so fucking insane that they lash
out at the nearest stereotype. Left-handeds. Renegade cops. The AIDS
Community. Doper Mexicans. "PLURry" ravers. We're going down the shitter and
I think people are smart enough to see this, but it scares them to death and
they don't know what else to do about it. 

The only way to get rid of cops is to make them unnecessary. Since you and
countless others (but not "we") have given up on evolving the ethical and
legal atmospheres that surround us in a constructive way, I don't see this
happening soon. 

eh

I was going to make this point in my last post, but I thought it would be
unnecessary: I don't think underground raves (as much as I like them) are a
realistic model for a society.

And they have Tomas working for them two days a week; straight up the best
ambient/dub/reggae/idm buyer on the west coast. (He used to work at Aron's
in LA) And he's also a great guy.

Regarding Cybotron stuff, it's been repressed - they have copies of Clear
at Primal and at BPM, and Trax records just put up a homepage (I think it's
www.traxrecords.com - I'll double check - where you can supposedly order
*anything* they've ever put out. Nonetheless, Open Mind is one of those
great stores that rewards you handsomely if you take the hours to go
through the used bins.

What about the people jumping on the floor of the upstairs, which is the
ceiling they would be hung from.  Skip-it-ti-do-da.  :)

Dear All... 
	I don't really post much, but I'm in this kind of introspective 
mood and had a few feelings that I thought would be pertinent to this 
list.  I thought I'd share what I've learned either directly or 
indirectly from raving this past year.  I guess it's appropriate as the 
past becomes the present becomes the future!! :)
	So, here goes; a few things that I've learned through "raving" 
(or "life" as the case may be) :

	how to better treat others in a relationship (be them friends or lovers)
	
	not everyone is on the same path as you, some people are also 
	further behind or further ahead

	the natural bisexuality of everyday life found in us all

There are a lot more, but these are my general feelings.  (not wanting to
get neither too personal nor too impersonal :)

I hope to get to meet more of you in 1996.  I've only met Wayne and Rikki
Keifer.  I also shared a wonderful time at the Gathering with some
wonderful friends, Rok and Dave, both on this list.  Hi guys :)

Hats off to 1996, may it be wonderful for all. 

Lots of Love,

kirsten

Actually.... Jon Carel and myself (who did sound upstairs) did just this,
which is why the turntables upstairs didn't bounce -- at all =)

Might have worked downstairs too, though in that case onr room's ceiling is
another rooms floor, so it might not have worked. Would've been nice to try
though; it's really hard trying to mix when you can't even cue a friggin
record...

take it easy

Yea, the guy at F-8 on haight was telling be about this ( same guy I
always see there, I wish I asked his name ). I think he said that not
yesterday but the week before was the first night. He said F-8 wants
to take over that whole block of haight (jokingly, although it's fine
with me) because they also are going to have a trance BOWLING night
across the street, I forget what night.

The Tues. at Boomerang sounds great! he said they even had lasers and
stuff. It just gives me this wonderful warm feeling inside to think
about them turning a boring drunk tank pseudo punk club into a weekly
little rave party. I love it. The fate of haight from F-8 on haight!

You bring up an excellent point, Dave; the playa should be no different
than anyplace we use.

To that end, I don't smoke, so no butts; I have picked up trash at every
Sunset I've been to, and left none; I spent all of Sunday morning at Burning
Man picking butts up off the playa.  I counted 178, plus all the other
trash I got -- so can I say it?  SMOKERS REALLY PISS ME OFF.  Every smoker
I've met claims that they don't drop their butts on the ground, and 
every single one of them does, sometimes during the same conversation.
Poison yourself, OK, but don't poison the planet with your little chunks
of fiberglass? 

Personally, I found that grinding the butt out, then stuffing it back in
the pack worked just fine for me, during the dark days when I smoked.
Please, please do this if you choose to smoke.

If that's someone's idea of fun, I have no problem with that.  I have
a problem when anyone, regardless of nationality, uniform, or anything else,
decides they want to infringe on my freedom.  (And before someone pulls out
the violence question, injuring or killing someone is the most serious of
infringements on their freedom.)

Constructing temporary communities ("raves") is a step towards demonstrating
that this is indeed possible.  If we can do it for a short time, we can 
probably do it for a longer time.  Gotta start somewhere, and the example of
a working community (even temporary) is stronger than any propagandizing.

Nothing that a high-speed ride through the desert on yer bike
won't take care of -- with motivation to go fast too!

PS: a bicycle IMHO is essential for the burning man experience, it's a fun
reminder of Albert Hofmann's innaugural ride.... (remember "bicycle day"
a few years back??).

You were doing good until you stereotyped blacks and hispanics.  There's

You make some pretty far-fetched assumptions, my friend.  Really 
inflammatory ones, too.  Your arguments assume that:

1. A given cop will select a certain group to pick on and ignore others.

2. That cops are not trained in what constitutes "probable cause", they just 
simply go on a set of prejudices, ie. whatever pisses them off most.

3.  In other posts, you assume that one would rather use power -- that does 
not really exist, is not condoned, and is punishable if caught -- to commit 
violence and theft.

Like I said, assholes are everywhere, but you can't assume every cop is an 
asshole.  And that being the case, I'd say those assumptions are baseless.

Any chance this is *not* happening at 174 King St?? If it is, there's
no way I'm going -- if nothing else, to prevent myself from getting
hassled by dickhead security, crowded anaerobic conditions, and people
getting all snappy and nasty because they're acting like caged rats in
an overpopulation experiment.

Please please please oh wicked folks, please move your venue!

Well, I'm going because I haven't been to a Wicked in months.  If the
crowding decreases some after 4 am (and it usually does), that will
be fine.  And presumably Doc will close.  Doc at 7 am at King St is
one of my favorite memories of this whole scene.

i agree that the king st. local is whack. i'm almost tempted to say that i
won't go if it's there, but doc martin's spinnin and there's no way i'm
missing one of s.f.'s finest. he my have moved to that smoggy city of star
struck surface level materalisticism, but my memory of the parties i
contributed to w/ him in 90-91, when he was still up here, are the greatest
ever!! (watch it wiggle; see it jiggle; little stacy's seafood salad-if any
of you remember these). i saw him play a month or so ago at roots and about a
year ago w/ dubtribe and he rocked. i wish he would move back.

Wassup all,


     This is only about the second week that I have been a part of this list,
and I must say that it has definitely bee a great source of info on da rave
scene. In all of the messages I have been reading, I keep hearing about these
sfrave badges. I would like to know how I could get one of these to meet
others. I am new to the scene and havent been to any real "raves" just some
sorry coolworld events. Everything that I read is up in  the City, and I'm
down here in San Jose. If there is anyone out there close to me into da scene
please E-mail me. Thanx.

Remember all who post messages like this usually want something for less than
what the going price is.  If they were willing to pay the going rate then
they would quote the going rate.  For all future posters of "I want a 303
etc" I am including a quick list of Roland 'xox' prices.  Here are the real
current prices for this gear.

TB-303 $1000 and up.
TR-909 $1000- $1500
TR-606 $150-$300
SH-101 $350-$500
MC-202 $350-$450

Sorry I know this is not rave related but since Andrew decided it was a good
idea to post his wish list to the list I figured I would provide a little
extra information.  I also am aware of Andrew's attempt to under value the
303.  If you want an example just check out XLR8 (I think... maybe Club
Life?) from a few months ago where in  an interveiw he says that the 303
typicaly sels for around $500 (actually he may have said less but I he did
not say anything higher)  Knowing that Andrew who already has a 303 knows
that $500 for a 303 would be more than just an "fair" deal I can only
conclude that he is trying to give people a different idea as to the real
value of the TB-303.

Thanks and sorry for taking up list time.  I know these kinds of equipment
requests should be posted to rec.music etc. where it would be more apropriate
and where people lknow the real value of equipment and can return appropriate
flames to the sender.  =o)

I agree...  174 SUX,  and I won't be attending...  until they change
venues.

Dude, anybody charging over $500 for a 303 is a con artist. I feel very 
sorry for people who pay 3 times the real going rate, because people like 
you have convinced them that it's worth that much. I have no idea what 
all those little silver boxes have been putting out since this whole 
trend-spreading net thing. I just know that it sure aint acid-house.

Hey, I was raving at 174 King St. before yo' momma learned how to use
contraceptive devices and before you was a piece of bubble gum that yo'
poppa gnawed off some hapless raver's ass that made the mistake of
sittin' down at some massive during the pleistocene era. I done my time
and my crime at 174 and I do miss the days when you could breathe real
air rather than the thrice-recycled "funk of a thousand years" from
people's stanky pits and yeasty groin areas ... Last time I checked, we
humans need oxygen to survive, and we don't do so well in an atmosphere
composed of evaporations from the sweaty goo that keeps people's
butt-cheeks from breakin' apart and wanderin' off in separate
directions... 

I mean really. Have some respect for yer elders. Damn kids. :-) :-)

I believe these are a little high, but that's my opinion from my experience.
I was just looking at a list of prices paid for the 303 and out of about 20
listings, only one was over $1000, with the average running about $600-700.
Out of 16 listings for the 909, none were over $1000.

I think this is a totally appropriate place to make a request such as this,
since we all know Andrew is making some of the music we listen to when we go
to raves.  Seems totally sfrave related to me.

I say paying over $300 bucks for that bucket of old bolts is a complete
rip-off.  You can find that piece, if you look hard enough, for about
$25-$300 bucks in used music places.  Check mission street at any of the
pawn shops etc.  Used music stores are always a good bet too.  I tried to
make a bid for one for a reasonable price of $250.  The guy laughed and
said that the bidding was up to $800, as he challenged me to prove I had
the means to purchase.  I laughed.  That rock ain't worht no $800 bucks and
anyone selling it for more than $300  is not only being a greedy bastard,
but a typical opportunist.  I really fell sorry for any schmuck who would
pay over $300 for that piece.  I own an SH-101, and that is just as good,
if not BETTER than the tb303, with a much wider tonal range.  I got the
sh-101 for $150.  And it has many more triggering options, better range
than the tb303, and has an actual keyboard.

Whatever, like the man said "There's a sucker born every minute!",

Sorry, but i must respond to this accusation. First off, i am making *NO*
attempt to "undervalue" the price of the TB303. There is no sinister
conspiracy on my part to rip somebody off. As to the articlae in 8LR8R,
it was true that i bought my 303 in 1991 for $65 dollars. At that time,
the "hype" surrounding it had not yet began and that was indeed a fair
price. It was also true that the second time i went to the music store
they were indeed selling them for around $500 (this was mid 1992). IT'S
TRUE! Can you believe it??? I did not make up these prices and i am
offended that you suggest i did.
As to the current going rate of a TB303, THE PRICE STILL VARIES WILDLY!
Two friends of mine recently purchased theirs for $350 about three months
ago. AGAIN, i am *not* making this up!!! there is no set price for a used
303. Some people chose to sell them for $1000 and up because they can
find suckers to pay that crazy price...

just wanted to clear all that up:)

I fully agree on the King Street nightmare - I've left voice messages asking
Wicked if there's something they can do -- the security people are Gestapo,
treat us like criminals, lurking about in the darkness with their walkie-talkies
looking for tokers whose stuff they can confiscate -- the toilets overflow
constantly (last month was a scary mess) -- the ladies room has had a stall
missing a door since I can remember and rarely has enough toilet paper -- the
heat gets unbearable since there's no circulation except 2 fans, and you're not
allowed in the hallway, which makes a fine chill space when it's available.
Ah, but I live for the music so I never miss it. November's sets were legendary
and last month was fierce.  We will suffer in order that we may dance!  It sure
would be fine, though, if the Wicked crew could find us a new locale! Or at
least maybe get a little sensitivity training and clean-up from the Townsend
management and staff. Too much to hope for?

It's funny how this gets dragged out right after all the discussions about
New Year's Eve profiteering.

>From my experience, the above is more than correct. One thing that happens,
though, is that people will scan the musical instrumemt selling newsgroups
and see people ASKING $1400 for a 909 or "best offer over $1000" for a 303
and take these quotes as the benchmark(et). What happens is that no one pays
these prices (at least not that I've heard), and that if you talk to people
and check out the Udes Gear Price List, 909's go for around $600, 303's for
$3-500, and 808's with MIDI always seem to hover around $500. Bear in mind
that these are Net Market prices and that you can always find your 606+303
for $125 as a friend of mine did recently.

Also a good point brought up on the Moving Parts list a while ago noted that
909's were $1200 brand new and that maybe there's some justice in seeing
them un-depreciated, especially seeing how much more useful they are now
than when they were new.

eh

I'm pretty annoyed at the tone of all these comments that have followed
Andrew's original trial balloon about getting a 303.  I will refrain
from naming names, but let's just LOSE the insinuations about hs
motives, the proper price for the equipment, the best way to buy the
equipment and all the other little judgmental stuff that is spilling
out.  Equipment-focused newsgroups and mailing lists are full of that
nonsense, people ranking on each other about who knows more about what
piece of gear and how that other stuff is useless, overpriced and all
that and quite frankly, I hope we keep that shit off of sf-raves.

peace out

No need to be annoyed.  Suffice it to say that I was not bagging on 
Andrew at all (I think Andrew knows me much better than that).  I was 
instead chiming in with Josh as to the rip-off's that occur when trying 
to purchase a piece of desired (in this case over-desired).  I in no way 
meant to bash or be mean to Andrew, and if he took my words that way I 
sincerely apologize.  He has said nothing to me about what I said, so I 
take iy he knew where I was coming from.



In any case, peace.  Now let's all take a deep breath, after all it is '96.

Peace,
John

I know Andrew pretty well, and quite a few of you out there in rave-land do
too. With that in mind, I gotta say that these venomous accusations and
personal attacks are quite a load of shit.

It insults our intelligence and the reputation of our friends like Andrew
to say such things. And the part inferring that he used his interview in
XLR8R as a tool to undervalue the entire Roland market for his own personal
reasons was especially out of line.

It sounds more like jealousy than anything else.

        So, I've been on this list now for almost a month, but this is the
first time I've spoken up.  I just wanted to let everyone know that while,
according to some of you, this scene isn't as good as it once was ( I
wouldn't know-I've only been around it for about 6 months), it's still an
incredible thing! I've gradually brought more and more new people to
parties over the last couple of months, culminating in Begin Again, where I
brought 16 people who had never raved before.  Everyone loved it, and, just
as I was hoping, it was the vibe more than the drugs or the novelty that
really did it for them, as it has done for me.  They all want to go to more
events.  This is a great scene we have here, so great that even when it's
not perfect (too crowded, too hot, pricey, fire hazard etc.) it's better
than just about anything else around.  I'm looking forward to meeting the
people on this list at some point, but that will come.  Anyway,
congradulations to everyone for making our community such a great one!

Not that I've been around forever or anything, but it's really nice to hear
a fresh perspective.  When I look at it this way, I can realize how totally
great that party was.  Thanks Alex.

 I see that Carlos is mixing in Santa Cruz this saturday , at something
put on by Hony's Pad:
   Saturday, January 6th - Hony's Pad Productions are proud to take you
   on a new realm of understanding
   DJs Carlos, Simon, Tony, Dan & Donald Glaude. at the Santa Cruz Civic
   Auditorium. 415.675.5980 408.469.5079 510.885.8178 707.551.7337

 Have the Hony's Pad Productions folks put on rave events before? Are
they OK? It's been awhile since I've heard Carlos , or been in the
Santa Cruz Civic , but I want some positive comments about Hony's Pad
first before I commit.

Isn't this a Plastik party?  I haven't been to a Plastik but there 
have been several of them in the past.  Does anybody have any experience
with them?  I'm thinking about checking this out because the
Santa Cruz Civic is about three blocks from my house, and that's a
significant difference from the usual drive to the city.
So I may end up seeing anyone who ventures out this way there.

Take care,
-john.

Hello Kids!!
I spent my new years in the place I least wanted to be, Circa in LA.  One 
word:  Zoo.  Complete production, complete with concessions such as pizza 
and cigarettes(we could not bring in our own). Anywho, it sucked.  The 
music was pretty good hardcore for about two and half hours.  I just am 
not into such large parties.  When there is so much distraction and 
everyones energies are scattered I feel too lost.,  Well, I recognized a 
few SF kids at this gig, but I was candyflipped and irritated so I did 
not get to talk to ya.  I was in a bright green dress with a black stripe 
across the front and black boots(never try to dance in boots... my feet 
are still numb) with a pacifier in mouth and cookie monster in hand.  
Anyone out there recognize me?  

 
Peace Out*  Jamie

If I have to delete one more message about the price of the TB303. Can we let
this die please.
Thanks.
PS I am an electronic musician who happens to like the sound of the 303 but
it's getting old. Why not blow everyone away and build your own modules.
Just a comment.

Hello All. I've enjoyed all the postings about this past NYE parties. But,
did any SFRavers go to 1015 for the SPUNDAE party? You wouldn't think so, not
a posting to be seen.....so here's my little humble 2cents. AWESOME! Stayed
until 7:30am and the place was still packed as it was at 11pm!
DJ line up was kickin' and Tecknotica in the basement with Carlos went off to
say the least. Chill rooms we great people watching and recovery time.  The
crowd was one of the best behaved i've seen, everyone was nice and friendly
and polite and fun. Most of all the staff left well alone.  
Went to the Spundae event NYE a year ago and this year was just as good, sans
the riot at DV8!
loved it
peace

That's the job.  If you can't handle it get the fuck out of the precinct.
I've got no patience for cops who can't handle their job.  Would you defend
a drunk airline pilot?  Of course not.  Then don't take any bullshit from
cops, because it's the same kind of job, we can't afford people who make
critical mistakes in critical positions, and misusing authority as a
police officer is in fact 1 of these critical mistakes in a critical
position.  Moreover, I don't buy that I need to put up with harassment just
because I live in a "bad neighborhood", as Ben Franklin said, those that
would trade a little liberty for a little security, deserve (and will likely
get) neither!

-------------------

Then I'm glad you're not a cop.  I agree with what you, about them having
to pick  up the pieces after people act really shitty toward each other,
but again, that's no excuse.

Would you work for a mountain rescue team if you were afraid of heights
and have trouble dealing with cold weather?  Of course not.  If you can't
handle junkies, murderers, corrupt politicians (oh, wait a minute, the
cops hardly even notice corrupt politicians... nevermind about that!),
and generally the scum of society and still keep smiling and maintain
that level head, then you're not cut out to be a cop, plain and simple.

Because police are in such a powerful and responsibility laden position,
we simply can't have cops who don't make the grade stay on the force, any
more than we can have airline pilots who drink on the job.

Please join me in urging new district attorney Terence Hallinan in the
best of luck in his (long overdue) house cleaning of the San Francisco
police department (no, he hasn't said he's going to, I'm asking you to
urge him to).  We don't need no stinking disruption of private parties,
New Years AIDS celebrations, Castro St. sweeps, corralling innocent
civilians in the mission into dead end alleys to be incarcerated, cops
who sell intelligence to the JDL on local Arab political organizations,
and all the other crap these "not fit to be police" police have been
pulling.  Stand or suffer!

It is a very likely model for future society, particularly as this one
self destructs.  If you can control yourselves for several generations,
you actually *could* do away with government entirely... it's an
evolutionary process... if we make it... [I ain't putting any money down
on which way it goes though, but first make yourself strong and then
reach down and pull another up, it's the shit!]

I'm sorry if I was out and missed something, but are the police no longer
human? 

As far I know, they _are_ human and are deserving of the same understanding
afforded other imperfectoids. Of course they are the most visible agents of
power in our society and they get the majority of criticism for it, a lot of
it deserved and a lot of it not. Cops control the law? You are misplacing
your energies and faculties if you think that the cops are anything but the
trench workers in the power game of society. Sure there are bad cops; ever
heard of the bell curve? But there are bad apples everywhere, deal with it
and get constructive. If you think cops are so bad because they sometimes
think you're a bad person when you can prove that you aren't (keeping in
mind, of course, that they've been ordered to find more badguys), contrast
your perspective with that of your neighbors here in our little online
social community who would tell you what you can and (page up a few messages
for an example) cannot post about on this list cuz their widdle finger hurts
from pressing the 'D' key. The tyranny of vocal imbeciles and public opinion
is more dangerous than statistical error, I guarantee you. 

As much as we here seem to fight against categorical prejudices, it's
telling that they are merely repressed until a convenient target comes along.

In anticipation of the small-minded rhetoric flames concerned with
particular experiences and stories, all that falls under "live-and-learn",
unfortunately. Look at the big picture - it can't be explained by a
soundbite or quote.

And one last, obvious, point: if you don't like the way the system is
working (I know, it's hard to see that we have one at all anymore), USE IT.
Fucking vote and let the democracy work. The revolution is never finished.

peace out, I'm done.

Hey all

Just reviewed the SFRaves Calendar, noted that there's NOTHING listed 
for Friday January 5th!  Is there anything anybody knows about that's 
happening that for whatever reason didn't make it onto the calendar?  
Was looking forward to some sort of a full moon rave, even if it was to

	While there may not be much to be gained by calling cops pigs, I 
can well appreciate the sentiment.
	I respect cops when they fight real crime.  Drugs, raves, 
prostitution, skateboarding, loitering, lack of permits, etc. -- I cannot 
respect cops who prosecute such "offenses."  You spoke the truth when you 
said that cops are there to "protect the structure of the society you 
live in."  That is the simple truth, and it is just as true that this 
structure is desperately flawed in many ways.  Thus to be a cop, unless 
you enforce the law selectively and with a conscience, is to be a 
misguided dupe at best and an instrument of cruelty and oppression at worst.
	Sorry if my views offend, that's how I see it.  If any cop wants 
to discuss it with me in a civilized manner, I'll be happy to do so.

Yours in liberty,

This week is the annual post-New Year's lull.  Still, this full moon 
party should be fun, and I don't know if Wicked is also doing a full
moon party, but they're doing one of the their monthly club nights
w/Doc Martin.  Doc should also be at Vanilla Fudge; the Top is also
supposed to be cool on Saturdays.

Well, it's that time again. We will be throwing a big party at Sausee's 
house soon. Probably after Area 51. Carlos, Dutch, Sausee, and who ever 
else. The cost is only $5. We had to paint the restroom cause someone 
tagged it. Should be a cool one. From about 10 to what ever. This time 
it will be in the BASSment, the back, the front, everywhere. If you've 
been there before you know it's the only true party house, NO NEIGHBORS 
at all. Give me feed back if you want to DJ or what ever.

Peace
M.C.

 I may or may not go , depending on wether anyone can give an opinion
about Hony's Pad Productions , who are running the event. I would like
to hear Carlos mix again , though. Anyone else thinking of going? I
live in Sunnyvale ( that's a town northeast of San Jose , for you
folks unfamiliar with the South Bay ). I wouldn't mind sharing a ride ,
although I don't intend to stay until sunrise ( then again ... depends
on the vibe! ).

i had a good time at Spundae..  friendly crowd, though definitely not
a raving crowd.  it was like a typical friday at 1015 except for more
people who only go out on new year's.  i was on the main floor for most 
of the time (9-8) and heard some great tunes & mixing from all the DJ's.  
it was good to see harry who.  stopped into the basement for
a bit but always seemed to end up upstairs..  i only wish i could have
convinced my friends to return for the cafe :)

this is my very favorite little writing:

DESIDERATA - found in old saint paul's church, baltimore; dated 1692:

Go Placidly amid the Noise & Haste, & 
  Remember what Peace there may be in Silence.

As far as possible without surrender be on
  good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly & clearly; and listen
  to others, even the dull & ignorant; they too
    have their story. ~

Avoid loud & aggressive persons, they
  are vexations to the spirit.

If you compare yourself with others, you may become
  vain & bitter; for always there will be
    greater & lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. ~

Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
  it is a real possession in the changing fortunes
    of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the
  world is full of trickery.  But let this not blind
    you to what virtue there is; many persons strive
      for high ideals; and everywhere life is full
        of heroism. ~

Be yourself.  Especially, do not feign affection.
  Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of 
    all aridity & disenchantment it is perennial as
      the grass. ~

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully 
  surrendering the things of youth.  Nurture strength
    of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with imaginings.  Many
  fears are born of fatigue & lonliness.  Beyond a
    wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. ~

You are a child of the universe, no less than the
  trees & the stars; you have a right to be here.
    And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt
      the universe is unfolding as it should. ~

Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive
  Him to be, and whatever your labors & aspirations, in 
    the noisy confusion of life keep pace with your soul. ~

With all its sham, drudgery & broken dreams, it is 
  still a beautiful world.  Be careful. Stive to be happy. ~ ~

	sorry this is popping up a little late, but i just read this...

i tried this on my way down to san diego last summer, when narnia was 
supposed to happen, (except something to do with the 1st letter of the 
alphabet) and when i got to SD, it was like a whole new world, being in a 
whole new city in such a refreshing state of mind.
	peace out and new experiences:) tom

They are, and that's why we shouldn't give people such power -- it's too easy
to abuse, and the motivation to misuse is stronger than the motivation to
use altruistically.  And so, in a nutshell, my argument goes.

Ah, but I can choose to unsubscribe from sfraves, and to start another list
with different constraints.  I can't unsubscribe from the US government and
start another (though it would be cool), because the government allows no
such behavior and will incarcerate or kill anyone who tries.  ("treason",
"terrorism", "subversion")

> The tyranny of vocal imbeciles and public opinion
> is more dangerous than statistical error, I guarantee you. 

I disagree.  I can ignore imbeciles, and the tyranny of public opinion is
what we have right now.  Drugs are bad, because it is in the interest of
several large industries to see that they remain illegal (timber doesn't
like legal hemp, tobacco and beer/alcohol don't like legal anything, big
oil doesn't like hemp either), so they ensure that mass media (owned by
only a few large conglomerates) keeps that viewpoint fresh and strong,
and public opinion (since we are trained to accept uncritically the mass
media) follows.

Statistical error?  Talk to Mumia Abu-Jamal, Rodney King, or any number of
nameless dead and injured people about "statistical error".

> As much as we here seem to fight against categorical prejudices, it's

I have never called all cops evil.  I have repeatedly said that the 
conditions of being an officer ensure that there will be more bad cops than
good cops.  Can you see the difference?

The freedom to choose one's master is not freedom.  "Whip, chain, or yoke?
You're free to choose."  

Sure, it might be beneficial in the short term to
choose a more lenient master, but don't mistake
progress for attainment.

 I've got one positive report on the Pastik folks , and no negative

2nd wedding anniversay , so it'll be our special anniversary thing ...).

 I'll have to change that - it'll just be my Mary and I in my truck! 
Anyway , if any of you folks are going , we'll be the older

Grigsbeast,

I agree with your outlook alot it's what I've been thinking about for a
long time.  Starting a list would be nice, but I see NO problem with
posting items like this and other political ones on SFRaves (it's extremely
unlikely they would take over this list-if thats what people are afriad
of).   As a generation we have been way too politically  and ideologically
apathetic.  These topics can only do us good i.e. theres nothing wrong with
being exposed to other's oppinions as long as they're not intentionally
derogitory.

What a beautiful sentiment--thanks for making this day that much brighter!  This 
is one of the reasons I enjoy being on this list, lots of positive energy and 
love floating around (well, most of the time).  I passed this on to a few 
friends and it was great to see that they were touched as well and are now 
having a brighter day because of it.

this is my very favorite little writing:

DESIDERATA - found in old saint paul's church, baltimore; dated 1692:

Go Placidly amid the Noise & Haste, & 
  Remember what Peace there may be in Silence.

As far as possible without surrender be on
  good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly & clearly; and listen
  to others, even the dull & ignorant; they too
    have their story. ~

Avoid loud & aggressive persons, they
  are vexations to the spirit.

If you compare yourself with others, you may become
  vain & bitter; for always there will be
    greater & lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. ~

Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
  it is a real possession in the changing fortunes
    of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the
  world is full of trickery.  But let this not blind
    you to what virtue there is; many persons strive
      for high ideals; and everywhere life is full
        of heroism. ~

Be yourself.  Especially, do not feign affection.
  Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of 
    all aridity & disenchantment it is perennial as
      the grass. ~

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully 
  surrendering the things of youth.  Nurture strength
    of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with imaginings.  Many
  fears are born of fatigue & lonliness.  Beyond a
    wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. ~

You are a child of the universe, no less than the
  trees & the stars; you have a right to be here.
    And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt
      the universe is unfolding as it should. ~

Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive
  Him to be, and whatever your labors & aspirations, in 
    the noisy confusion of life keep pace with your soul. ~

With all its sham, drudgery & broken dreams, it is 
  still a beautiful world.  Be careful. Stive to be happy. ~ ~

Anyone who complains that is ain't what it used to be is the one making 
it so.  Keep positive and the scene will continue to flourish, despite 
natural ups and downs, but it will always be alive.  YOU make the scene 
what it is, so make it what you would ideally like it to be.  For me that 
would be pure LOVE.

Well I live in Santa Cruz, and the only decent thing I  have been to here 
was when Wicked threw the Full Moon in November.  I went to The Freakers 
Ball at the Civic, but the vibe sucked booty.  It is a great line up but 
I am not prepared to pay 20.00 after getting suckered into 27.00 Circa 
just last week, but that is my personal delimma.  It might be OK, but 
Santa Cruz kids have yet to prove to me they know how to get down.  Thank 
goodness San Frandisco is only an hour away...

This will be (as the flyer said) the irst massive of the year..

I will attend this event because a few of my friends are moving away to CO
and they are going - I know many people in SCruz going - (never been to the
space) but heard its a large "round?" gym type warehouse - 
I have attended Plastik parties before and have had a good time - the last I
believe was in Livermore (??) were Freedom was held.   

A little gossup = I have heard that Plastik is now Hony's pad productions and
was formerly Ghost tribe productions.  Ghost tribe was booted from the group
for some unknown reason (to me) and this is the first party by "strickly"
 Hony's pad.  I've met a few of these guys and have heard good ideas from
them so I see good posibilities in the future.

I didn't get to party NYE (workd till 3.30 am) so this will be my  post New
years celebration with friends.

Larry happy anniversery - If I see ya I'll say hi
Any other sfravers I'll be wearin' my laminate so try to over come that

*delurks*

hey, I was there and had quite a good time... for those of you who where
there wondering if you saw me, I was wearing a Conjunction Junction t-shirt :)

my only complaint would be that for some reason, Ira, the owner (my friend
Jason, who was a DJ much of the night in the front room told me about this
since I was upstairs by then) shut down Tecknotica early muttering some
weird vague things about security and this and that...apparently this isn't
the first time he's done unecessary things such as this according to a
couple of my friends

but, other than that I had quite a blast and was, along with my two friends,
one of the last people out the door to witness other SF partygoers roaming
around the city the morning after in their best clothes returning home from
other parties..looked funny

anyway...bye

If you choose to think that, I'm sorry.  There will always be people with
more or less experience, etc., but I have lived in co-ops where decisions
were made communally, and such power as anyone held (usually by convenience:
such-and-so is dry goods buyer) can be easily overruled if people feel a need
to do so.  The key is a group small enough that decisions can be made on
a person-to-person level, instead of through bureaucracy.  See my next point.

I have agreed with you before on this, and continue to agree.  We have
constructed a mode of life (characterized by scarcity of land and resources,
and subsequent uneven distribution thereof) that is so unbalanced as to 
require a police force.

Um, what?  On the evolutionary timescale, the previous 4,000 years of
city-based civilization (using the term loosely, and covering time in which
_anyone at all_, let alone most humans, were city-based), are a recent
aberration.  The tribe of 20-150 has been (and is) the historically natural
aggregate of primates, including humans, for hundreds of thousands of years.

Please don't insult me, sir.  The First Amendment also specifies that freedom
of assembly and the press shall not be infringed.  We won't even get into
unreasonable search and seizure, quartering of armies during peacetime, and
enumerated rights, because they are currently a sick joke (and if you don't
believe me, go read the Bill of Rights yourself).  The US Government today 
is in violation of almost every Constitutional provision and amendment 
you can name -- which helps to prove my point that power tends to be abused,
no matter how well constructed or intended.

Who are your city council members?  Who's on your county board of 
supervisors?  Can you name your local elected judges?  Can you name your
state and Federal senators and congresspersons?  How about your local 
ombudsmen/women, water quality board members, city manager, mayor, vice
mayor, zoning commission, and all the other people whose decisions directly
affect how you live your life?  It's practically a full time job to even
know their names, much less know anything about them and the decisions they
make.  

Government has become so large and pervasive that it is impossible
for citizens to place reasonable checks on it, because just finding out
what it's doing is more time than anyone has.  I do not think that it is
reasonable to blame citizens for not fixing something too big to comprehend, 
let alone affect.  The only thing to be done is reduce it to a size such
that people can participate in it in a meaningful way -- which means,
compared to the current leviathan, effectively zero.  For example, the
Iroquois Confederation, upon which much of the Constitution was based.

I have never stopped examining my beliefs, which is why I'm where I am.
However, if telling people that one can have freedom if one takes the
responsibility of being free is "mentally, socially, and spiritually
toxic", then I guess I'll slap on that "BIOHAZARD" sticker and move on.

But seriously, I believe that 
information is only dangerous to those who would hoard it, and freedom
is only dangerous to those who would deny yours to suit their purposes.
As you said, people can hit 'D' anytime, and if you want the standard
viewpoint on things you can go read Time, Newsweek, or the Chronicle or Merc,
or go watch the news.

I just find it curious that, on a list where people spend most of their
time talking about how to throw parties without getting shut down by the
government and its agents, many people are so quick to defend it.  Instead
of trying to reform "the system", maybe some thoughts about alternatives
are in order...?  Just a toxic thought.

Hey all

Look for me at FMR tonight!  I'll be wearing a distinctive t-shirt, 
once you see the front of it, you'll recognize it in an instant!  So if 
you see it, come up & say hi!  I always enjoy meeting new sfravers, and 
also enjoy re-meeting ones I've met before.  So I'll see you there!

Wassup fellow sfravers my name is Chris, I'm 20 years old, and I live in da
South Bay. I've only been on this list for a couple of weeks, and enjoy
reading what people have to say about all the parties. I myself have not yet
been to a real "rave", thus I am posting this message. I know this will
probably sound desperate, but I'm looking for some fellow sfravers to let me
"tag along" wit them to some events. I'm not really into the drug thing, just
want to dance, meet new friends<ladies>, and just kick it and have a good
time. I would also like to meet and keep in contact with some people in da
City so when I go up there, I have some friends to chill wit. I am more than
happy to help with funds for gas or whatever. Everyone posting all these
messages about how fun all these raves are, and I'm stuck down here in San
Jose with nowhere to go!  Most of my friends dont know shit about raves and
are not interested in them at all(can you believe that?) Well peace, love,
and all dat to any and all that have stuck through this message. If you want
to get back to me, you can E-mail me, or call me on my cell at 408.896.4143
anytime after 7pm. Thanx!!!

The US Park Police have been *very* effective at harassing all potential
FMR goers tonite in the Presidio.

I am not sure if the park police actually shut down the sound system itself
but when I got near the party location I was pulled over three times in my
car in a 10 minute period and harassed by two different officer (one of
them harassed me twice!) It seemed that the police knew something was
happening around there and the way they were dealing with it was to pull
over *any* car that was driving through the Presidio and question them and
search their vehicle.

Anyway, the plan is to move the party to a new location around 2am. So call
the voice mail info line for more details on where it will be moved to. 415
536 9453 is the number.

So me and two friends were wondering where to go Friday night.  We passed 
the endup and thought that we might wind up there at some point.  We 
passed Club X and scoffed.  We wound up at Mecca.  I must say I had one 
of the best experiences I have ever had at a club!  Great vibe, really 
nice friendly people, great tunes fun location great lighting effects.  I 
give it two thumbs up.  :)

It is against the LAW foe police to harass you, also it is AGAINST the 
law for the police to search your car unless they have probable cause. 
I've been pulled over just because I was wearing a bee-nee(sp). The cop 
wanted to search my car and I said NO. They don't have the right to 
even stick their head in your car. It is private property! He kept 
trying to say that I has hiding something. I was not. I had absolutely 
nothing Illegal in the car at all. I just didn't want him to search it. 
They have to get a warrant to search your car if you refuse to let 
them. If they happen to damage your car in a search, they are 
responsible for it. 
 One time a cop shorted out my friends amp with his metal flashlight. 
It was pretty cool to get a new one paid for by the Police.

Peace
M.C.

Yeah, but they can also arrest you "hassling them", even if it's not a
legal arrest that would/could result in any kind of charge -- i.e. refusing
to the search, they can arrest you for "resisting arrest", put you in the
can, tow and store your car, etc. for any contrived reason, including
simply being uncoopreative.

Remember that when an officer asks you for your license, you need to
quickly and politely give it to him, becuase at that moment you are
*technically* under arrest. Anything you do that is not cooperative can be
considered *resisting arrest*. Yes, I know that it sucks, but it's the
truth.

In my case, during my second stop, he said that "he was in the middle of an
investigation" (which I took as the investigation of the party going on
somewhere in his area of jurisdiction) and his probable cause to stop *me*
specifically was that my car doesn't have a front license plate.

My 10-28/10-29 (car/person radio check) came back clean (of course), he
interrogated me as to my whys and wheres (why are you here, where are you
going, what are you doing in the Presidio at night), I answered with *just
enough* information to satisfy his questions, we talked about my car for a
minute or two, and he let me go on my way. Even though I resented being
stopped that second time, he still did have cause to stop me because of my
missing license plate, and I knew it. In fact, he could have given me a $30
fix-it ticket and he didn't, so I was actually pretty happy about that.

The first and third times I was stopped it was for simply *being* and
*driving* on public roads inside the Presidio, and those times were
definitely harassment, pure and simple.

questions:

(1) any rave DJ's playing there?? If not, it would behoove some rave 
"group" to contact mayor-elect brown and get permission to hold an
outdoor rave event in front of the party (read, "dancing in the
streets" for us, and "pleasurable overflow crowd control" for them).

(2) i think it's on tuesday? anybody got more or correct information?

Surely there's some interested political bridge-builders, politically
connected readers, and/or interested DJ's lurking or posting on this
list?

I heard Da Mayor will be sworn in @ Pier 42.

I am going, and trying to get my posse to go so we can grub on FREE crab,
shrimp, steak and assorted other goodies.  Get ready people, SF will NEVER,
I repeat, NEVER be the same after Monday.

And:  Why can WE have a party using one of the piers?  Maybe it's time we
ask for permits to have a party there.  If Da Mayor can, why can't we?

Asnwer:  We ain't Da Mayor!

 BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Either call 800-218-5157 via voice Monday and ask to talk with Lou
Vallier, or Dave Salch(Sysop, Dave is totally cool sysop type guy, I think
there should be a sysop's day just for Dave), or call 800-474-1818 via modem
to create a new account. Someone asked is the $25/month a flat rate, yes it
is, for unlimited connect time, all day everyday as long as there up!!! I
think Liberty is great, & they have there problems just like everyone else.
I like them because their a big/small provider. I practically know everyone
who works there, just from doing bussiness with them for over a year now,
and am very happy.

        Technical support is available via voice, or chat from 9am to 12pm 7
days a week.

        Also, Liberty has no real sales force, their users are the sales
force. If you get enough people to sign up you can actually get PAID $$$$ to
use their service. I think  if you get 9 people to sign up you end up making
like $2.00/month & use the service for free, it's really cool. There's no
limit on the amount of comission you can make, the only limit is the number
of people you get to sign up.

        Honest I wouldn't sell you something I either didn't use myself, or
didn't receive excellent feedback on, my reputaion is worth much more to me
than free Internet access. The fact is actually right know I've never gotten
anyone to sign up at this point so I'm still paying the $25/month.

        But if ya do decide to join, just mention that I Brian Darkness told
ya about it and I will get credit for it. See ya in the chat area.

First off the party will be @ Pier 45.  At least that's what the news is
saying, and that's also the word on the street.

As for my comments, how can you not see that SF will never be the same?
Fact:  ALL the board of supervisors are backing willie brown EXCEPT for Tom
"Say Shay" Sheih.
Fact: ALL of his politico cronies are throwing this big bash, food and all,
voluntarily.
Fact: Willie Brown called himself, the Ayatollah of the Assembly.

You are about to witness a political machine that will make Mayor Daley's
Chicago stint seem like an off broadway act.  Sf is about to get a real
political maven as it's mayor and as such, you will see things you have not
seen, in terms of political movement, in decades.

This will also be one fun city.  C'mon, Frank Jordan was a nice guy, but he
was quite uninteresting.  Our Da Mayor has been seen, with active camera
crews, shopiing for new hats, clothes.  He has made announcements as to
what types of suits he will be wearing along with other outrageous fun
stuff.  This place is one party city (it IS where Willie hangs out), and he
will turn this place into a serious party town (everyone knows willie LOVES
parties).

If you think it's going to be business as usual, you run the risk of being
labellled politically naive.

No, I'm afraid that I'm quite correct.  This place will never be the same.

As for him not meeting my expectations, I have no expectations of him other
than he run this place like Daly ran Chi-Town.  I doubt seriously that I'll
be disappointed.

Peace,
John

Directions to SF from SJ:  Go North 60 Miles, and make a sharp left!

I Love SF, I'm glad we don't have republican shit here, and I'm glad this
is one left-wing ultra liberal political machine city!

Out.

At first, Wicked was GREAT!  Fantastic music, great vibe!  But around, oh, 
2am, they started having serious problems with the sound system.  Massive 
feedback.  It would be ok for a while, then BOOM!  I had finally remembered 
to bring ear plugs, and even then I could tell it was really loud, earth 
shattering feedback.  Finally, we got kinda irritated with it and took off.  
Besides, we had a newbie that couldn't stay out too late, so we went to 
Treasure Island, put some tunes on, and danced next to the bay with a view 
of the city.

Hey y'all,

There are actually 3 parties on Monday to bring in ol' Willie. One is open
to the public, and the other two are private (but if yer willing, maybe you
can sneak in  ;).

We've been invited to all three, so the day should be interesting.

Freebie:  Soul of the City
          6pm at pier 45, Embarcadero at the foot of Jefferson
          Party Attire requested

Invite:   11:30am at Yerba Buena Gardens
          (Invite, but Yerba Buena is public space, so go for           it)

Invite:   4:45pm at St. Patricks Church, 756 Mission St.
          (Space limited to the capacity of the church. Again,
public space).

 
Though we haven't been up for playing or anything up, we plan on approaching
Da Mayor and informing him that the kids in SF want to dance again. 

Hopefully, T.Hallinen will be there and we can ask to see what steps need to
be taken to request changes in the current laws that prohibit all age
dancing in SF. With everyone in good spirits, perhaps they'll remember us later.

Later, once they get into the routine of their new jobs, it would probaby be
cool to get some signatures and approach Hallinen and/or the Supervisors and
request making some changes.

Change doesn't come easy, but with a little persistence, maybe we can get
the authorities in this town to relax and let us dance.

I'm not much of a political activist, so those with more experience should
come on down to one of the above parties.

later...

Jonas

Frequency 8 Trance in the Woods
-----------------------------------

This Sat evening calendar of rave events was really sparse.  The FMR was
busted,  which left only Wicked.

Late Sat Afternoon I talked with Jonas Judd at Frequency-8 and was able to
talk him (And Mars) into throwing an outside underground Trance party,
and sure enough,  a posting was made in SFRaves about the party,  so my
next job was to fork a ride.    I finally was able to get there,  which was
on a
wide spot of a famous trail (refraining from giving any location info).

For setting up an outdoors renegade on such short order,  a day after FMR
was busted,  shows a lot about the dedication of the trance movement here
in SF which is growing and thriving very well.

We get there about midnight and found the last parking spot on the main
road and headed into the woods.   My friend Pete who's a first time Raver
wasn't sure this was going to go off,   but as we approached the area,  we
could hear the music and see the lights shining from the trees and the cliffs.

Surge was spinning some incredibly sick acid trance,  which echoed through
the forest in such a way as to enhance the entrancing effect of the music.

Just last week,   I met Surge at F-8 record store on the Haight and he sold me
his latest tape.   WOW!!  I'm impressed.   My Trance collection is growing,
and I'm more convinced that trance is coming on strong here in SF,  with the
great efforts of the F-8 record store,  Mars,  Alien Life force and Mystr-E.
(which I just picked up his latest tape).

After Surge,  Mystr-E got behind the decks and literally blew my mind all
over the forest.   The evening,  although crisp and cool was excellent for good
solid non-stop dancing.    Mystr-E really tore it up BIG TIME...

After Mystr-E,  Mars got behind the decks and did an excellent set,   just like
the good old days of Summer.

Anyway,  the F-8 party went off without a hitch,  despite the fact that the
sheriff was looking for the party.  Everyone cooperated and did a great job in
not allowing the heat to find our secret location.   Yay!!  Sure beats
trying to
dance in an overstuffed,  crowded, smoky sweat box at 174 King St.

I got plenty of good fresh air,   got in touch with nature,  and had a great
time,  dancing all night to some great goa trance in a natural setting.  For
those that didn't go,  you missed a wonderful experience.

Dear Sami,

	I am in the city, but we are looking for a roomate... if you're 
interested in S.F. as well, it's a nice place.  Rent is $410 a month, and 
it's close to major Muni lines & about 4 blocks from BART.
	We're at 16th Street, just south of Market...

Much Love,
			<<< Starchild >>>

P.S. - If you know any other ravers who are looking...

And I didn't mean to insinuate that you didn't know what was up.

Willie Brown is the definition of old-time politics.  I will take great
delight  in seeing what happens to our city under his rule.  He has already
started asking the board of supes for more power.  Result: He'll get it!
This is only the beginning folx...as for a new mayor ANYTIME soon.  Keep
dreaming, this will be a lifetime appointment.  Just watch, you'll see.

I love politix, and love to see the machine, when well greased, work.  It's
also an easy way to make money since I will be able to bet on what will
happen vs what won't, sit back, and collect my money from those who dared
to bet me.  Luckily for me, making calls on Willie Brown will be rather
easy.  If he wants something, his history dictates, he'll get it!  My
money's riding on him getting everything he wants.

And why not?, After all, he is Da Mayor!

Hahahahahahaha! This WILL be something to see! <ROTFL>

Peace & Welcome to the 21st Century's last liberal bastion of hope:
San Francisco, CA.

Yes, I'm lovin' it,
John

Hey everyone,

Normally, I would never post for anything at DV8, but tonight there's
something a little different. 

Not only do we have our own Mystr-E in the techno room, but Marcos Lopez
from Superstition Records out of Berlin will be playing the peak set from
12:30-3:30 on the main floor. 

Techno on the main floor of Spundae? What a concept.

Check it out...

        It's simple.
        Think of it not as an end but rather as a beginning. A beginning of
a world in which you are able to re-define yourself FOR yourself. I
_totally_ know what it's like to end a relationship, i had one of four
years (and i'm only 23) end last march and it was tough and confusing. It's
rough, and it's only human to feel a sense of loss.  Always remember
though, that you're never really alone, especially if you're involved with
something as supportive as raves and internet lists :)
        Remember to love yourself buddy! :)

Could someone give us more info on what happened Friday night?
Specifically, I heard that John Carel had been arrested and possibly
others.  I'm very concerned about this situation.  It's only because
of timing that we weren't out there too -- Brenda, Geoff and I and
others were down at The Top groovin' with the Hardkiss crew and awaiting
the directions.  Later we went over to Rocky's until we heard the last
message about the arrest(s) and so forth.

After last weekend was such a fizzle, it was good to come back to SF
and have a *good* time.  I came down with new sfraver Shakti (Brenda)
Friday evening.  We went over to The Top for the Friday weekly shindig
with the Hardkiss crew, with Robbie, Gavin and Scott taking turns.
After a while Geoff showed up and we spent a fair bit of time trying
to get info on the Full Moon location.  Just when we got through, I got
word from the Crunchman that it had been shut down.  We stayed to closing
and then went over to Rocky's to monitor developments, of which there were
not many until the voicemail message was changed to indicate the event was
a total wash.  I fully appreciate the effort everyone put into trying to
make this happen, and hope we can learn from this and bounce back to more
success in the future.  

Saturday we got a late start, and our Gracious Tour Guide, Susie, took
Brenda and me for an excursion around town, featuring a fine sunset at
the Cliff House, including a quick whirl through the Musee Mechanique.

We stopped briefly at Ashbury St. for the gathering in honor of our
globetrotting WBLer, Steve Lerner, and then checked in for a set of
Broun Fellinis and The Baroness at the Elbo Room.  With us so far?

Next stop: Wicked!  Now, I have had my share of adventures at King St.
over the years, feeling somewhat less antipathy to the place than many
others here may (quite justifiably) have.  That place has unerasable
memories of the 1992 scene for me, the Hardkiss Birthday Party, Doc
swinging the joint at 8 am, all of that.  But it was always a bet
whether King St. would be crowded and smokey or, sometimes, more
crowded and worse smokey :)  In addition, the last Wicked I went to
was there back in about May, and featured the cruddiest, most over-
distorted sound I heard all year.  

Well, all that was behind us last night.  The sound arrangement is no
longer two lines of stacks corralling the dance floor, but closer to
a true four-corners arrangement (if they would double the back stacks 
for balance it would be perfecto).  The bar and DJ stands were reversed
compared to the old days -- the bar right at the entrance and the DJ
at the far (Townsend) end.  All this opened up the whole room and made
it possible to get more people in and still have enough room to move
around.  It was crowded but not packed between 2 and 4 am and gradually
loosened up after that. 

We arrived about halfway through Thomas's set, and I actually was rather
favorable toward it, he veered toward that old SF funk sound in the
latter part which I was really glad to hear again.  Markie did a lot
of genre-hopping, some of it not terribly successful in my view.  

Doc rocked the box, pulling out one of his classic swan dives from
straight-ahead disco to deep, deeper, deepest house.  Best of all, 
the sound during his set -- always a problem at Wickeds in the past,
was *really* good, maybe a little too hot at the very high end with
the high-hats sound, but clear and punchy.  I don't know what Wicked's
crew did to make this happen, but as one of the most chronic complainer
about their EQ and distortion in the past, I want to be the first to
applaud this considerable improvement.  It really added to my enjoyment.
Garth finished up with a half-and-half set, seemed like the first half
ran very well with what Doc set up, including an absolute *caning* of
Plastic Dreams (at least six or seven minutes worth, instead of the old
two-minutes-hands-in-the-air-then-mix-out everyone does with that one)
which really highlighted the superb production in that track.  

This was probably the best Wicked I've been to since late '93 or early
'94 -- of course, I missed the Pierre and Little Louie nights.  I thought
the crowd was so-so and would have benefited from a late surge from te
other clubs, which always adds a nice element to the floor after 5 am,
but believe me, I'm not complaining.  Once in a while ya gotta do house
music all night long :-)

I wanted a 303 because I wanted the acid sounds also, but found a
much better way to go about it, assuming you have other sound interests
also.  Check this out.

--------------

The unfortunate thing about the 303, IMHO, is that it really only does one
thing... it does it well, but it really only does one thing in a 
parameterized way.

I don't know what an "sh-101" is, nor what it's good for (although apparently
it's good as a cheap 303 substitute), but I found a synthesizer that does
the 303 sounds, along with nearly every other sound you've ever heard on any
house-scene-related-music source, whether it be house (deep, acid, trance,
etc.) or seriously fast techno, acid jazz, ambient or any of the other sub
genres that have arisen.

I'm not sure if these are available new anymore, nor what Roland model was
supposed to replace them, but the JD 990 can do all the acid blips you can
stand, as well as being able to provide an incredible array of both preset
sounds, + 1 of the easiest interfaces I've seen on a digital synth (it's
not exactly a secret that digital synths tend to have horrible user
interfaces for designing sounds from scratch, or modifying existing sounds;
the JD 990 has a much better interface for doing this).

You can't get this shit for 150.00, nor for 300... I paid 1300.00 for this
puppy new, but given the way technology devalues I would bet that if there
are units around to buy used, they would be probably half the price I paid
or less.  Given that this machine can implement your entire tune, and that
you can get much more than just acid blips (but you can do that very nicely
also... I've done it), the price performance ratio is more what I'm looking
for.  After all, 3 or 500 dollars for a machine that only does one thing
isn't very cost effective, IMHO.  Higher prices obviously make it worse.
The other thing about the JD 990 is that it's professional quality gear,
meaning if you're serious, you can press the music you make with it, many
of you have been hearing this machine for some time on a vast array of
records of many styles, including those discussed here.

> Whatever, like the man said "There's a sucker born every minute!",
---------------

The 303 is a perfect example of what Barnum was talking about, and when
a machine is revered for its historical use, it becomes ripe for this
kind of idolatry.  Actually, so do people who become revered for their
"contributions" of whatever kind....  For example, an 808 is another of
these fabled machines... there's no need to buy one since there are much
better ways of providing editable slamming rhythm tracks, but many folks
want to have them because it's the machine hip hop was born on, (not to
diss SL 1200's), and alot of early house stuff as well.  But the truth
is, these machines are less flexible and more difficult to work with
than many of the machines made more recently, many of which are probably
better machines anyway, but didn't become as famous.  Samplers can easily
play back samples of 808 drum sounds + many other drum and percussion
sounds, for example, and when keyed from a Mac running studio vision or
performer or some other MIDI recording package, you have much more than
1 lousy 808...

Unfortunately I have never really enjoy hearing music in the civic because
it's such a barn, it is very cavernous, echoes alot and the bass tends to
be very, er, missing... I haven't been there in years, so perhaps a very
skilled sound man could make it right, but that's what it will take.

You took off way too soon... The bugs in the system were eventually
exterminated, and Doc Martin laid down a most impressive vibe. All the
non-rave elements (security, alcohol, ginos) were half-lived into
nonexistence, and the whole scene came alive again after 3am.

The visuals were just okay -- very low tech, and a bit repetative. The
atmosphere was surprisingly bearable.

The big missing was soft, comfy, chill-out space. Metal chairs just
don't cut it. The other big missing was the rip-off $2.5 they were
holding the 1/2 l Calistogas for all night...

Anyway, it was rEALly hard to pull myself away at 5:00.

by the time claire & i got back from changing the voice mail/directions
there were cops swarming the area telling everyone to go home that the rave
was busted.  actually, they only thought something was going on because of
all the cars and the large vehicles which could have had equip in there
(they couldn't see inside so they didn't know if the equip was loaded or
unloaded outta the vehicle).  it took them over 2 hours to actually locate
the site.  in the meantime, they harrassed everyone they had the manpower
to stop.  it was kinda hallarious that the party was happening right down
the hill and they had such a hard time finding it - but then again, that
only caused them to be bigger jerks by the time they finally found us.   
 
yes, one person got arrested, but i'm not at liberty to give details on
that.   
 
it woulda been a good one too.  we saw soooo many good groovin' friends
that we didn't expect to show up.  oh well, there's always next month!

1 Of the most important concepts in our society is that you are innocent
until proven guilty; this alone appears to be in a confused state in your
perception of these issues.  Our society depends upon this innocent until
proven guilty rhetoric to be more than just rhetoric.  This is one of the
few things that distinguishes us from a totalitarian society.  I'm quite
concerned that you seem not to be clear on this.

---------------

So you are using this to say what?  We need better control and oversight
of the police for just that statistical probability you mention, not to
mention keeping power mad assholes from running amok.  Noone is saying the
police have an easy job, just that they need to perform up to a certain
standard or else they become a menace.  This isn't insulting, it's true.

---------------------

Living and learning means taking political responsibility for your 
community.  You are apparently arguing against that for some unknown
reason, because you feel police are unfairly treated.  Like I said before,
police who can't stand the heat need to get out of the precinct.  When there
are problems with police oversight, the responsible thing to do is to  
discuss the problem and find a solution, then to pursue that solution.  
That's exactly what's happening here, so why are you so disgruntled?

Living and learning doesn't mean allowing our society to lose its grasp
of Democracy, it means struggling to keep that in sight.  When authoritarian
agencies work without civilian oversight democracy is definitely threatened.

I couldn't agree with you more about this last point, and it's the reason
I've been harping about this all along.  Get involved!

Ok, I'm out too, but I'm not swearing to silence...

Being a synth-a-holic myself, I felt that I had to put my $.02 into this 
discussion...
I agree that the 303 and 808 are hyped more due to nostalgia than 
practicality.  There are really few machines from back in the 80's that are 
worth more than a couple of hundred dollards still.  Also, the 
house/rave/techno scene tend to be so focussed on Roland that often no 
attention if paid to some of the other great synths.  So here's the ones I 
feel are really worth it:

Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 - If you have not played one of these, you 
have not experienced analog synthesis.  This keyboard drove everyone from 
the Cars to Talking Heads to Q-Feel and pretty much led the 80's syhtn 
revolution.  You can get great acid effects out of it.  It has the best 
interface of almost any synth I have ever played.  All the control knobs 
are right there in front of you so you can change the sound while you 
play.  You can also store and load tones to/from cassettes.  

Yamaha DX-7 - Classic digital waveform synthesis.  This synth was the 
front-runner for the new Yamaha algorithm synthesis methods.  Once again, 
this synth was everywhere.

Roland D-10 - again, great digital synthesis in a new style.  Wonderfully 
rich tones from a digital keyboard.

Fairlight CMI - After seeing Herbie Hancock and Thomas Dolby playing 
back-to-back on various Fairlights at the Nation Association of Music 
Merchants winter market show in like 1986 I never looked at these classic 
samplers the same way again.  It was amazing what those machines and 
those men could do.

Getting more modern, there is the new NordLead digital analog synth that 
is supposed to be able to do just about anything that the old analog 
keyboards were able to do (but for a price) and there's the Novation BS-1 
(list around $650) that can do just about every booming bass and acid 
thing you can imagine, including the 303 stuff.

anyway, that's just some thoughts from out here...
Peace!

Yeah, what's the fucking problem, you promoter types?  Don't you know
people doing psychedelics need to sit down and relax for a while every
now and then? [smiley for the humorously impaired...;-)]

I've been dismayed at the chill environment at nearly every rave I've
been to over the last year.  There have been exceptions, but not nearly
enough.

We need football fields full of beanbags, with things to look at and
listen to, and air to breathe, etc, so quit yer slacking, boy!

I did completely enjoy myself at wicked this time though, even though,
like the wimpy npm, I don't wholly approve of King St. myself either,
I've been much more impressed by other venues... even Townsend, although
I don't know if Saturdays there are ever available anymore.

I was particularly impressed with doc Martin, who I credit with showing
me that there was indeed good house related music.  I thought I spoke with
him after he spun and talked with someone I thought was him who didn't 
clarify my mistake, and did a good job of impersonating doc.  The guy
even knew the name of the old club doc used to spin hip hop in before
becoming a rave DJ (I realize he spun in more than one club in those
days, but I used to make a habit of catching him at the 16th note/
firehouse 7, where he used to spin cuts like "like is Too $hort", etc).
  Then I said "it's good to hear you play again" and walked over to the
DJ booth to see... doc Martin!  I enjoyed it, kudos to this masterful
impersonator.

Jon was detained for a short time and released around 4am. The US Park
Police have the free time to spend harassing people, and that they did.

I think this is fairly degrading to the original poster - just because you
don't like Willie Brown doesn't mean that someone else is somehow less
intelligent for believing in him.  It's okay to have political opinions, but
please, remember that intelligent discussion of an issue is one thing and
mindless bashing of someone else's position without a scintilla of backing
evidence is quite another.

Saturday's party was one of the best Wickeds in my memory! 
In spite of my complaints about King St (bathrooms worse than ever! no toilet
paper at all in ladies' room meant paper towels clogging every stall early on -
come on folks, indoor plumbing is important to keep running smoothly - this
place need to get their act together!) and overzealous Gestapo security (geez
those flashlights appear out of nowhere when you least expect it) --
But the vibe was SO SO cool and the music was incredible - I think Thomas's set
may be the best I've ever heard, he never lost us for a second with that wicked
funky groove and Doc Martin ruled - and there were such openhearted happy people
there - I just want to thank every smiling face who said hello or introduced
themselves to me (I was wearing the floppy black hat with the tattoos on my
shoulders) - especially Keith with the red mohair hat and overalls, who took the
role of spreading the connection and talking to everyone all night and -- and
Jim and Scott whose rad dancing inspired everyone around -- you all really made
my night, I went home in the morning feeling happy and connected - and ALL
DANCED OUT! 
My greatest moments of awe are when I realize there are so many millions of
people in the world who have no idea how happy, blissful and ecstatic (truly)
you can feel when the music and the people are all there riding that wave
together.  We are so lucky to know the power of music.  Right before I went to
the party, I watched the scene in Shawshank Redemption with the opera - it's the
same thing - music can bring us into that part of who we are that touches the
essential, the spirit, the place we belong! 
So thanks everyone who was there - you made my weekend! 
Leslie

Hey

Just wondering, has anybody ever heard of a CD (an import I think) by 
City of Angels?  It has a song on it called Organic, and that's all I 
know about it, & trying to find the name of the CD.  Any help would be 
appreciated!

I just wanted to say thanks for putting on this thing to F-8, Jonas,
Surge, Mars, Myster-E, Adam, and whoever was involed in this. After
the FMR bust Friday night, I was very wanting of an outdoor event. I
love Trance, so this really hit the spot for me. I was the dancing
fool with long-hair under a grey-blue binni and a black fleece
jacket. Had a fun time. 

Anybody else notice how wonderful the acoustics is of a sound system
in the woods? It seems like you hear everything more clearly because
of the lack of reverberation. Love it!

Thanks.

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Well, I'm sorry Jon got arrested/detained, I'm sorry the rave got
busted, & I'm even more sorry we live in a country where a so called "Park";
under Federal jurisdiction, by a government run & OWNED "By The People, For
The People", is considered & treated as private property. I really get out
raged when I hear this. Ya no, I can understand something critical to our
nation/worlds defense, or a place that's extremely hazardous to one's health
& welfare. But not a former military base, that's now a park.

        So my question is, who are "The People", and when can I meet them?

        So why do you think there were so many cops, the answer; it's
Federal Property. Why are the fines & penalties for trespassing on Federal
property more severe than private property? I wonder if I had a hundred or
so unwanted people in my home, or on my property, how many cops they would
send, and how many people they would arrest? The Presidio is suppose to be a
park, but do you have any idea just how much that land's worth, or would be
worth, to a private developer. You may see Park Presidio for awhile, but I
guarantee, that it will slowly & eventually be Park Presidio, Community For
The Super Rich. Hell, maybe they will even use the money they make from its
sale to help reduce the national debt(not!!!!).

        I also wonder about the motivations behind someone throwing a rave
on Federal property, unless that it's clearly a demonstration about the
state of property ownership in America, as well as the rules regarding the
management of land clearly owned by a so called free people. The penalties &
fines if you get caught are very serve, much more serve than private
property. I don't know how the courts end up dealing with these issues,
because they are the final say regarding the interpretation of the law/s. I
would like to image that when it comes down to sentencing, that they would
assign stiffer sentences to people who commits acts against private
individuals rather than the people, as long as it wasn't something like
national/world defense related land.

        But for the purposes of throwing a rave, hmmmm, if you get caught
you're putting a lot of innocent/non-innocent people at risk of a possible
misdemeanors(non-significant to a person's life in lower degree levels), or
even a felony charge(very significant).

        I want to make clear I'm not saying go throw a rave on some little
old ladies house/home, or that it was a bad idea to throw a rave on federal
or city property for that matter. What I am saying is, that if you are gonna
throw a party/rave, and it's an illegal one, to look at the purpose of the
party/rave, & maybe give it some direction. If it's just for a good time,
than the location should provide the people attending with the least amount
of risk to life, & limb; while still providing a venue that offers something
exciting & interesting. But on the other hand, if you want to make a
statement by throwing a party/rave, about something your & others around you
are passionate about, then the risk to life & limb should be, but not
necessarially higher. 

        Even though the party got busted, if the event had gotten some press
it would have made an excellent & peaceful statement about the condition of
land ownership and the belief systems that support it, as well as a
statement about how free 'We The People" really are.

        I saw an opportunity to have fun, and it was fufilled. I also saw an
opportunity to make a statement that I know a lot of you share; waisted. I
rave to have a good time sure, but more important, I rave because I'm among
a group of people who share similar beliefs. Beliefs about truth, the
sacredness of individuality, honesty, clairity, community, spirituality;
over the oppression of organized religion, acceptance; going behond
tolerence, love, peace, & responsibility. 

        I don't rave because I'm so tired of fighting for change that I just
don't care anymore, and all I want to do is just be high. I don't rave so I
can sit around and be stoned all the time & complain about how shitty the
system is, and not do anything about it.

        We as a group of kind people have tremenous power in numbers. Many
of us are a united group of world citzens that share common belief systems
that approach a global reality & perspective; not just a U.S. With our
oneness of mind, heart & soul along with our technology we are the
generation that has the power to change the world, and make it a better place.

        But more often than not, we take a lot of risk, for just a good
time. This action alone however will effect some positive world change, but
it could be so much more. I don't mean to be critical, but as we sit back
and rave & party, without direction most of the time. There are others out
there, with the same oneness of mind, heart & soul, with the same ideas
about changing the world, with access to the same technology that we have,
who have much darker & oppressive visions of how our world should be, and
this I fear more than anything else.

        The elections are once again coming up in 96, & this time I hear
Ralph Nader is being nonminated by the Green Party for President. Please
lets not this opportunity for positive change pass us by. If I do but just
one thing in 96 to effect world change, it will be to vote for Ralph Nader.

	well i got my first sh101 for $80.  i got my second one
	for free.  (same with my jupiter 4, yamaha cs15...)
	some people place no value whatsoever on old analogs,
	you just have to find them.  however, i have been looking
	for the tb303 for years and have yet to come across one.
	i will, eventually, i am sure.

	also, the sh101 is most definately *not* a substitute for
	the tb303.  nor is the mc202.  the 303 does some tweaky stuff
	with matching envelope amount to pitch or something like that,
	what you whear as the constantly-variable slides between notes,
	basically.  it has some parameters that the 101 and 202
	simply do not have.

	each of the old roland babies has it's specialty.  the 101
	is the workhorse, the 202 is the brain, the 303 is the tweak,
	the jupiter4 has an arpeggiator that *by itself* can keep a
	wasted chill room in pure sonic pleasure for 20 minutes.

	"a sucker born every minute?"  if you have the means, and nead
	the gear, and that is the only one available then you pay the
	price or get nothing.  that's capitalism.  you may not like it,
	but what would *you* sell your tb303 for, john s. lee?

work with me people, I'm trying to describe the frequency 8 experience:

it was very mystical to be seemingly in the middle of nowhere surrounded 
by trees lit from spacey blue lights dancing to as crunch said "sick acid 
trance".  what more could you want.  

I do admit though the drive up hwy 1 and the 15mph twisty turns just 
about made me spew...  how do people do it...

" ... I don't like this stuff - it's nervous white people's music , y'know ? "

      Overheard in the men's room of the Bahia Restaurant / MAD , Jan. 8 , 1996


 After a nice intimate dinner in celebration of my 41st birthday , my wife Mary
and I went to MAD at the Bahia Restaurant. Due to various other commitments
since the start of the year , MAD was my first dose of 'rave' in 1996!  And it
was like a cool drink of water after a drought.

 We got there fairly early by club standards - 9:57 PM , three minutes before
the "official" start time. Of course , the high standards of those involved 
ensured that we walked into the place greeted by a fully functioning sound
system being fed delicious music by Alex. 

 Alex was on until about 11:20PM , when DRC took over the turntable(s). 
Unfortunetly , it seemed to me that one of the turntables died during her set,
leaving DRC to play the tracks sequentially instead of mixing them .  

 An impending work day Tuesday forced me to leave before Ethan got on , so 
someone else has to report on how his set was , and whether the turntable 
troubles got fixed.  It was nice to see so many familiar faces again - I 
couldn't think of a better way to celebrate my birthday!

  Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - Flyer for next week's MAD ( Jan. 15th ) says that the DJs will be :
        Jon  Santos ( Detroit )
        Joe Rice ( Berkeley )
        Special Guest David Cooper ( Toronto ) 

PPS - I don't know if the guy meant " nervous music of white people" or
      " music of nervous white people" - probably a little of both.

John is fine thanks.

As for selling a tb303, I would sell it for anywhere between $250-$300.
Since I am a man of means, and since I do not beleive in a grubbing
free-market laissez-faire attitude toward others, and since I am not always
looking for maximum profit, selling it at that price would be no problem
for me.  But why would that suprise you, my previous post SAID that I
wouldn't buy it for anything more, why would I front, and try selling it
for more.

Rocky, I talk the talk, AND I walk the walk.

As for the sh 101 being a substitute for the tb303, to each his own.
Andrew of Astral Matrix, myself, hardkiss, and others use the sh 101 as a
sub for the 303, and it does a great job of outdoing the 303.  The more
modren synths make the 303 a mere toy, with all the routing options etc.
the 303 is truly an obsolete, overhyped piece of history.  Whatever, if you
can't do without it fine.  Others have done better without it, some have
done worse.

Buy what you want, that will suit you need.  But don't get rippied off doing it.

And yes, there really is a sucker born every minute.  Just ask the fool who
bought a tb303 for $1000 and see what they think about thier purchase.


Nuff said,
John

There was a club called Amazon in Sacramento that I used to go to several

As I said before the coronation of our great king, Willie L. Brown Jr., 
San Francisco, CA. will NEVER be the same.  Not optimism, fact:

Chief of Police:  Fred Leiu (sp?) - Asian-American
Fire Chief     :  ?? (forgot his name, do know that he was the one who 
brought a federal lawsuit of discrimination AGAINST the fire dept of SF.  
Now SFFD is under the federal eye as it STILL integrates) - African-American
And some other interesting appointment, like civilian oversight is now 
run by an African-American Lesbian (who was part of the prosecutorial 
team AGAINST Ollie North), is now on civilian oversight comission.

Nope, I doubt I'll leave the most left of cities anytime soon.  This eems 
to be just the start, the hard part for Willie will be the blanacing act 
as he tries to appease everyone.  But then again, he has really made no 
promisies, other than it won't be business as usual.  By his appointments 
so dfar, he has at least lived up to that claim.  Hey, city hall is 
starting to reflect the diversity of the city.  Finally.

Diversity roolz dood.... ;)

(I have not stopped laughing since Willie received his lifetime 
appointment as Mayor of The City.  If nothing else, this will be a very 
interesting town to live in for the next 4 years.)

hahahahahahahahahaha!  Da Mayor, hahahahahahaha!

Go Willie GO!

Willie Brown sure knows how to throw a party!  I had shrimp cocktail, asian
food (I have no idea what it was but it sure was good!), stew, ice cream,
watched Brazilian and Central American dancers & danced to Santana for a
couple of magical hours.  Did anyone else go (besides you Tony)?  The
Valley of the DJs was alright, though I think they could have done better
if they'd posted a request for help to this list...hopefully this is a sign
of brighter days to come for all of us, and through us and others the rest
of the city!

David

That's like saying, the Enola Gay just took off for Japan!  Nagasaki will 
never be the same!  Boy that city has been BORING, but it's going to get 
REAL exciting in a few hours!!

>hahahahahahahahahaha!  Da Mayor, hahahahahahaha!

Other than putting a better mix of people into government positions, I 
really don't anticipate anything good from Willie.  He's the ultimate career 
politician -- and that's a scarey thought, cause career politicians are in 
it primarily for themselves, and that's all.  I'm not knockin' him, I'm just 
not rooting for him either.  I always felt that, while Jordan was, as you 
put it, *boring*, he seemed to really care about the city and it's welfare.  
I don't get those vibes from Willie, y'know?  This guy is more concerned 
about his image and power than anything else.  

'Course, you may be right.  Ole Willie may rock the house.  It will 
certainly be better for all of us on this list if he can loosen up things 
for raves.   But IMHO, he's got Wessonality...

Hey out there...

Does anyone know if there is anything going on this coming 
weekend, January 12-13?...I didn't see anything on the 
calendar. Some of my friends had been talking about some 
parties but I don't know which ones they were talking about.

I was raised around politics for the majority of my life.  Politicians 
are politicians.  I would elect a politician to do political things, 
that's what they do.  I want someone in there who can cut the *right* (or 
*left* ;) ) deal.  I want someone in there who can not only get thier 
palm greased (a by product of politics), but also help thier constituents 
out.  Jordan was not able to do the job, so the people  elected Da Mayor 
to do what Jordan couldn't.

SF will give just about anyone a chance, and they will throw the person 
out as well if they don't perform (ask Agnos, another leftie who couldn't 
live up to even his OWN expectations).  So I'm really not worried.  Sf 
needs an enema.  this place has gone backwards in terms of being 
progressive.  I think that if nothing else, at least for the next 4 
years, SF will be a fun place, and exciting place to be.  I gues you have 
to understand the entire Willie Brown posse, from his son Michael, all 
the way to his bedroom where he keeps that cutie of a girlfriend of his 
(yes, Willie is STILL married, hahahahaha!  Man, this guy IS slick!).

SF need someone who can move the board of supes, Willie will be the man.  
It's really not a matter of me being hyped on him so much as me being 
hyped on the potential for change.  The fact that in less than 12 hours, 
he's appointed Asians and Black (two underrepresented and FORGOTTEN 
peoples in SF politics) into very visible key positions of power, mean 
that this will not be like the SF of any recent past.  The fact that more 
appointments are coming leaves plenty of room for more change.  The only 
thing he need do after creating this machine is turn it on and see if it 
runs/ then see if it works.

I am willing to give him, just like I gave Jordan (fro 4 years no less), 
the benefit of the doubt and see what he does to make SF a place where I 
can raise my son.  So far, I must say, I have been pleased with the 
general direction he's taken.  He should continue to push left, sensibly, 
and in short order, after he's built his machine, put it to good use.

Only time will tell.  I got a couple of years, I'll stay and watch the 
proceedings with great interest.  Rest assured, if he kicks butt, I will 
give him propers all over the place.  If he fucks up, I'll dis his ass 
all over the place.


> I'm not knockin' him, I'm just 
> not rooting for him either.  I always felt that, while Jordan was, as you 
> put it, *boring*, he seemed to really care about the city and it's welfare.  

Debateable.  Do you live here that you can please qualify that statement 
as to how this city has gotten better under and with all his caring?  
Shit is bubbling to the surface about police misconduct, inefficiencies 
in govt., muni sux, etc.  Gang rapes have become quite commonplace in our 
city for the last 6 months now.  Naw, Frank Jordan, like most borin 
bean-counters, cared about the bottom line.  Yes, he balanced the budget, 
but at whose expense.  Yes, some streets were safer, while others became 
havens of death.

I was a STRONG Jordan supporter, but even I knew that many of his 
policies (those that existed anyway), came far short of delivery.  He 
even reniged on SOMA being a nightspot and has made a crusade of getting 
rid of night spots in the city (usually citing crime), and let the cops 
have a virtual feild day with partygoers.  The number of venues (and thus 
revenue generation) shrunk under Jordans reign, while htere are new 
condos everywhere (isn't this fucking place built  up enuf?).

Yep, Willie get my vote of confidence for the next 4.  After that I'll 
analyze and see wassup.

> I don't get those vibes from Willie, y'know?  This guy is more concerned 
> about his image and power than anything else.  

Willie is concerned about his image, I want politicans to be concerned 
about their image, since there is little else to shame them.  I want him 
to be concerend about his poweer, thru power you can engage in action.  
through action you can change things.  And I want a tough ass, greasy 
politico in there when he/she has to deal with others of that ilk.  
Politics is about that, ask any freshman House Member.  As hard-assed as 
they wanna be, even they have to make concessions at times.  BKA grease.

100% here!  And that Wessonality is a real +.  Sf hasn't had these types 
of politics in years, and I look forward to a behemoth of a machine 
getting some real stuff done.  It's the only way to make the supes do 
anything (and they've done NOTHING since Jordan has been in office).

Willie Brown sure knows how to throw a party!  I had shrimp cocktail, asian
food (I have no idea what it was but it sure was good!), stew, ice cream,
watched Brazilian and Central American dancers & danced to Santana for a
couple of magical hours.  Did anyone else go (besides you Tony)?  The
Valley of the DJs was alright, though I think they could have done better
if they'd posted a request for help to this list...hopefully this is a sign
of brighter days to come for all of us, and through us and others the rest
of the city!

peacelovejoy,

Nero fiddled while Rome burned? Perhaps a little melodramatic, I like a 
party as much as the next guy, but someone please tell me that Willie 
payed for the party out of his own campaign funds rather than tax 
dollars. Anyone know?

The only thing that impacted the tax payers, were the extra cops 
required.  Everything else was DONATED by various restaurants and 
eateries in the area.  The local carpenters union built everything 
GRATIS, everything was, from my understanding, DONATED.

Now THAT'S slick!

Thanks for the info. I still think that Willie Brown is the epitome of 
what is wrong with politics, but am glad to hear he didn't spend taxpayer 
funds on the party. You are correct John, he is slick. But definitely the 
lesser of the two evils.

hello all, and thanks for reading a non-rave message.  i'm shopping around
for a good isp with either an 800 or 408 number for my father, an
accountant.  it needs to have the following things-
	1) full e-mail access
	2) ability to create and update a medium size www home page
	3) ppp or slip acess prefered, he doesn't have isdn or 10BaseT

i've heard good things about many, but there's so many, i don't know where
to start.  any suggestions, please let me know!


peace, love, and isp's-

Nonsense, John.  There are things a 303 can do that no other machine
can do, because it was so brain-damaged to begin with.  That's what
many of the people I know who
've worked with all of these units tell me -- Taylor808 for one.

And if it's worth $1,000 to you to have that flexibility, then a 303
is definitely worth $1,000.  I have paid under market prices for gear
(computers and ham radio stuff, mostly), and felt ripped off, and I've
paid more than the "going rate" and been quite happy.  It just depends.

It
It's like that with records, too.  I saw an old U2 12" single I wouldn't
have paid 50 cents for, but the price tag said ** $50.00 ** and meant it.
And someone bought it for that price, because that is what it was worth
to them.  In that kind of collector's market, there's no telling.  I've
got records I bought for a dollar that people tell me are worth upwards
of $100.  Would I sell?  No way.  It just depends.

ive twiddled on the jup. 6 i think perhaps it was the 8. nice board, esp. 
w/ balanced outs and midi. ive got a juno 6. sweet, but the chorus is 
noisy, and the volume knob is too while adjusting it. insights?
sh101 and mc202: boy, if only i had these. the triggering is real good, 
and i really love the oscillators roland is famous for.
mainly i like to experiment with raw waves i've sampled (w30 workstation 
sampler) and filter/effect them for good patches. i wish there was some 
party where people could bring some gear and jam. ive seen single cell, 
velocette, etc. etc. these guys are good, but there should be a spot 
where it is more open. and what about females? the whole elec. music 
thang is such a 'boys w/ toys' gig. too bad.
some of these synths are really good for percussive sounds too... just 
adjust the sliders -

frequency down, resonance up...

------------------------------

I'm really glad Willie beat Jordan, as I disagree with you completely on the
issue of Jordan caring for the city; people who care about the city don't
hand it over to downtown big corporate business and organize things like the
1989 Castro St. sweep... these are things that Jordan did.

1 Of my fears with Willie is that while I doubt he's the type to organize
a crime like the Castro St. sweep, he might just turn the city over to the
corporate elite because some of the serious heavies are clients of his.

--------------------------

My Wessonality meter is keyed primarily on to issues:

1.	getting municipal power in SF and bagging P.G.&E.

2.	disallowing the sale of Viacom cable to TCI Communications,
	and forcing Viacom to comply with the current contracts they've
	signed, but are defaulting on several of the requirements.

These two issues alone would make so much money for San Francisco that
if he gets these both done, I'll be truly impressed and will sing his
praises for days, possibly longer.

More importantly, there are legal realities about both of these two
issues that mandate municipal power and Viacom living up to existing
contracts but the scum of city hall (currently, Jordan and Smith) have
apparently been paid off by campaign contributions or some other less
obvious manner of payment, and have decided to ignore the fact that
municipal power in San Francisco is mandated by the Raker Act (is
that the correct act?) and that Viacom has failed to honor terms of
their contract... probably, aside from the corruptive influences, an
easy pair of cases.  Aside from the corruptive influences, that is.

That's how I'll be judging both Willie and Terence, so with that in mind,
I'd like to say...

Go Willie!

Go Terence!

And P.G.&E. and Viacom... get the fuck out of San Francisco, already!

Damn!

Sounds vaguely like someone here is an avid reader of the Bay Guardian... ;)

 I'll shut up soon (I swear!), but I was just informed
that there's an interesting show on the gulf war on channel
9 right now... it's not the guardian but when you piece
together stories from disparate sources and they all add up,
it begins to create a coherent image...

Ok, I'll admit I've read about that crap in the bay guardian, but
I've been watching political machinations for years... after a while,
you can do it by feel... I just use papers like the guardian to cover
things like fact checking, which I suspect they're fairly truthful
about that sort of thing.

As for how to detect things like how you're being cheated, you just have
to practise reading between the lines, whatching what people say, and 
more importantly what they do.  Later you begin to make correlations
between what a politician or CEO will say, and what action that will 
eventually translate to, but it takes some time, and so on.  It's kind
of fun, but I hate seeing people get as shamelessly burned as by
PG&E, especially since I'm one of 'em, so I had to pipe up.

lat,

Oh it wasn't any kind of flame, just an observation. I respect the 
Guardian for the kind of journalism I think we need more of. Much more 
"real" than the watered-down AP/UPI feeds that we all end up with. As far 
as I have seen they state what they believe to be the facts and site 
sources when possible. The only fault I can find is that the coverage can 
tend to be a bit one-sided sometimes. But all in all a decent paper. 
Always been good for the club listings....

	still, there is something in the sequencing of the 303 that
	the 101 has no functionality for.  i have to remember what this
	is called exactly though, i'll have to get back to you. the 101
	is a *beautiful* instrument, i would never get by without my

	*quite* there.

	jessica wing (www.cyborganic.com/People/jessica) is one third
	of the current synth lineup of weird blinking lights.

	i have a jupiter4.  i wish i had the SPACE for a jupiter8,
	or the means to buy the super-jupiter (rackmount!) that i know
	of for sale.  but alas, i have more gear than i know what to
	do with at the moment... oh the jupiter4 does great percussiveness,
	especially with the arpeggiator.

	emusic jamming is an interesting idea, but tough.  logistics,
	power, sound and SYNC SYNC SYNC.  not to mention the oft not-so-
	pleasant cacophony that would likely develop...

well, i've kept my mouth shut for long enough...to see how people feel 
about Will being mayor...

anyway, as working for UPS and being the Teamster that Iam, I had the 
chance to go to a little gathering to hear democratic politions speak. 
One of them happened to be Willie. 

First off, let me say that the guy should have been a Snake Oil Sellsman. 
or else he should be in Maryland selling snow...the guy can talk and get 
you to love him...

Second, he doesnt care about SF what so ever. he gave a speach for Local 
70 and said what his plans are...to become mayor and then use that as a 
stepping stone for governor. Will might know how to have fun, but for SF 
becoming better, that will never happen. yes there might be more raves 
happening, but then again, i wouldnt hold my breath. i think if i heard 
on the news correctly that there is a Chinese police chief. (if im wrong, 
tell me, not flame me ;) do you really think that a Chinese police chief 
is gonna say "hey, you wanna have yer parties where people do drugs and 
problems could arise??? GO FOR IT!!!"  i think not. Jordan might have 

As SDream said, "Jordan might have been a bore," but he wasnt a liar that 
Will is. Jordan told you what his plans are. Will didnt happen to mention 
in any speach that he gave to the SFers that if the city goes to hell, it 
goes to hell, oh well. 

just something i thought i had to say....sorry.

You know, I thought this list was all about being above the fray of some of

What in the HELL is with this racism.  This is plain onld bullshit and
doesn't deserve even my slightest wrath.  But, I'll make an exception for
racist bigots like you and correct you here and now.  First off genius, the
Police Chief's boss is Da Mayor, if you understood the power strcuture of
this city, this would be obvious to you as your racism.  Next, you have a
left wing DA who wants to reign in the police.  Thrid you have an African
American Lesbian as the chair of the police oversight comission.  As of Da
Mayors coronation the other day, the police will be reigned in, or one
would suppose so with the current power structure in place as it stands
today.

The REASON the cops went on a rampage was that they had the full sympathy
AND support of Jordan who was a Police Cheif himslef, and since you know
little about this, the tone is set at the top.  The cops acted the way they
did becasue the Mayor, your Frank Jordan, was more than willing to allow
these tyransgressions to occur, and turned a deaf ear when anyone
complained about them.  Thus the flurry of court action now pending against
SFPD.

No, I'm afraid that things will probably change for the better, Asian
Police Chief or not.  His race has NOTHING to do with it.  He takes orders
from the top, Da MAyor is his boss, and HE sets the tone for police conduct
through HIS inaction or action.  Willie has also said that he plans to
reign in the cops.

Your racist attitudes toward Asians is probably indicative of other racism
as well.  I am sure it is seeping into your views of the first
African-Americqan Mayor of SF.   No bother, Jordan lost, his days are over,
now we have someone who can get things done, vs someone who is honestly
inept and ran this city into the ground.

I would strongly suggest that you check your racism, the shit has no place here.

And SDream doesn't live in SF anyway.  Do you?

Shoulda checked your racism homey, you didn't have to say that.  I feel
very sorry for humanity when people like yourself pop up and start spouting
a bunch of racist shit.  It really makes my heart sink.  No bother, brother
Willie is in office, got a nice Asian Brother as Police Chief, got a fine
African-American as Fire Chief, got a nice African-American Lesbian sister
as police oversight.  I feel safer already! I also feel as though we have
the greatest potential for change now that all the old white guard is out
of friggin' office.  Now maybe city hall will start to resemble The City,
not just downtown.  If you were watching the coronation the other day, and
saw the sea of color, you would know humdreds of thousands feel as I do,
and thus Da Mayor is now running the show.

You can leave now.

Out,
John

        I went out with a friend to MOS EISLEY lastnight, had a blast
dancing to Marcos Lopez & some hard German Techno.

        Ended up back at Peter of Kode IV's house, very interesting person.
I felt so bad, I listen to a lot of his/their stuff, and didn't even know
who I was sitting next to on the sofa. God, I thought those dudes would be
like hangin out in Goa or someother techno exotic place in da world, other

        Killer night for sure.

You're right, that is racism, and i totally agree. but unlike you, i've 
learned the difference between racism and bigotry. racism is noticing a 
difference in race, which *everyone* does. even you my fine politically 
correct friend. but iam not a bigot. what i pointed out is something that 
i know more about than you ever will. i've been associated with asians 
all my life. i could tell you anything and everything you would ever want 
to know about asians. and what im pointing out to you is the truth, 
something which all liberals never want to hear because they feel that 
they are in the nice socialist fantasy land and never want to leave it. 
i dont care *who* his boss is, or *who* the DA is, its his police force, 
and trust me on this one, he's gonna run it how he feels is fit.

No, i think this has to do with the hirering practices of the SFPD. as 
been beaten to death on this list is good cop bad cop. every dept. has 
good and bad cops. you seem to enjoy the media, and the media is willing 
to fill you with your hearts content of how bad cops are. there is 
nothing mentioned in the media about good cops. and there are good cops 
on the SFPD force.

you should check your socialism. how is what i said bad to asians? tell 
me. how is it? i told you the truth about asians, something you should 
learn. do you really think that every minority in the USA is all for this 
big brotherly socialism??? HA! i feel very sorry for this country when 
people like you cant shut up. its no wonder that we are the hell hole 
that we are. its no wonder that China thinks of the USA as a bunch of 
screaming little kids, because of people like you. 



face it, you're mad because i heard and pointed out something you didnt 
want to hear. i hurt and interuppted your fantasy land. i told you the 
truth. why dont you stop insulting me and start to realize that your God 
Willie is a liar? you dont want to admit the truth. i heard what i heard 
at my Union Hall. you didnt. you're mad. you're trying to go off the 
subject and call me a bigot.   go back on the subject, or are you too 
hurt by what i said, that Willie doesnt give a damn about SF, its all for 
his own political clout.  


> You can leave now.
 so can you.

does anyone know where I can find a book called"What kind of house party is
this?"
by Jonathon Fleming. It is a British book, nice and thick, full of info and
pictures
on intrernational dance culture. Is there a book store called Ameba(?) down
there
that might have it?..thanks, Brian Lyons, Seattle.

I'll preface this by saying that I'm ABSOLUTELY NOT trying to solicit
another analog vs. digital flame war. I know that analog sounds fatter,
better, etc. I also know that I'm far too addicted to MIDI and sys-ex to
play with CV or proprietary sequencers. If you still feel the need to dis
the digitial, you can privately email me.

Since everyone's offering their opinions on music hardware, I thought I'd
ask if anyone's tried the new Korg Prophecy. I'm seriously considering
getting one. I played with it for about an hour in a dealer showroom, which
really only afforded me the chance to be blown away byits preset sounds. I
didn't get a good feel for how tedious its programming interface might be.
I read the Keyboard review, which pointed out a couple of bugs that occur
when you try to trigger the arpegeator from external source. I'm still
hyped about syncing the arpegeator to a MIDI clock, though. I'll have to
push all its buttons before I decide to lay down the $1k, of course, but I
was wondering what other people thought of it.

It was pretty amusing to pull up presets named "Rave til Dawn" and "TB303."
I guess that would be my main criticism - that it seems to be geared toward
imitating past innovations rather than creating its own. It's hard to say
that for sure, however, without programming a few of your own patches on
the thing.

but you're right in the way that not all asians are alike. But the Chief

OK, so you're chinese.
And therefore you know that all chinese are alike.
Which must mean that all chinese are like you.

It must be pretty intense to be speaking for >1 billion people.
But then also sad to be so lacking as an individual.
So what is this "Negative Utopia" that you call yourself?
Is it a psuedonym for "Chinese Person"?
Oh, nevermind.  Seeya on the dance floor.

Thanks John for responding!  I was at MacWorld all day yesterday & didn't
see this until now.  My point was mainly that since the Mayor enabled
commuinities to come together and throw such a party that perhaps things
will change and it will be easier for THIS community to throw parties in
the city as well.  Whether you agree with his politics or not Black Adder,
I think you'll agree this is a positive step for us, and, if we can
increase our energy, a positive step for all those whose lives we touch.

Perhaps we should invite Da Mayor to a party & let him see what its all about...

happyinlovewithallofyou,

oops ... lost my text in there somewhere, let's try again

Gotta put my 2cents in here --Just a comment on some judgmental perspectives
here...Dudes, listen to yourselves...

The first person says it's racist to make negative assumptions about a Chinese
police chief -- and then makes positive assumptions about Chinese,
African-American, women, lesbians -- on down the line. To me, racial stereotypes
are racial stereotypes, whether they're positive or negative. 

Let's be honest with ourselves we ALL tend to stereotype -- and maybe that's not
always wrong.  Certainly there are some general tendencies toward value systems
and behavior patterns that occur in different societies, are there not?  And
those different societies are the foundations for the people that come from
them.  And each of us has that historical background of behaviors in one way or
another.

But while these racial stereotypes might work for broad sociological
generalizations, or to give us a possible hint at a person's possible values or
behaviors based on his or her background, they really aren't a very effective
way to judge individuals, who are much more complicated than that, especially in
our American culture where we have so much intermixing and exposure to multiple
cultures and value systems.

Can we make assumptions because a police chief is Chinese?  Nope, not really.
Because someone is African-American?  Nope.  We may have a vew likely qualities
we'll find in those people, but our generalizations become pretty meaningless
when we're talking about individuals -- it's when we make assumptions based on
race or gender that we become racist or sexist -- and likely to be wrong.  

Not to mention the nasty attitudes toward each other in these messages... how
about a little respect guys?  If you want someone to respect your opinions, have
some respect for theirs.  That means taking a minute to PUT YOURSELF IN SOMEONE
ELSE'S SHOES and try to see what the world looks like to them.  Give them some
credit for being a thinking, caring human being, and you might be able to
understand their opinions a little better -- even if their viewpoint doesn't
agree with yours.  Who knows, your mind might be expanded a little.  Isn't that
the point? 

So peace.

Polticians have been throwing themselves parties for a long, long time. 
They never have problems getting permits. But I haven't yet seen them 
making it easier for the general public to get permits. What reason have 
they had?

Better yet, why don't we just agree to put up a Mayor Brown poster at the 
door to every rave, and instead of calling them parties when we apply for 
permits, call them mayoral celebrations.  That way, Da Mayor (John's term) 
would take it personally if the cops busted the party.

 I am typing this in my room at the ANA Hotel , a block away from the
Moscone Center , which is presently hosting MacWorld. I am typing
this on an ancient Mac Plus! Just the machine for what I'm using
it for (email and simple word processing).

 I guess , if I'm not too tired , I'll try to check out some stuff
in San Francisco tonight. I see that A.D. is still on the calendar -
isn't it no longer happening?

 And then there's the thing with Timothy Leary that someone mentioned
in a post here.

     I was reading the coverage of Da Mayor's party in the Chronicle, and 
     it struck me that all the things that Willie said about why the party 
     was so nice and worked so well were EXACTLY the same things we say 
     about raves.  Stuff like they're diverse, chaotic, but peaceful, and 
     so forth.
     
     Yeah, let's invite Willie out.  I think the first daytime outdoor 
     party of spring would be good -- gorgeous weather, great music, and 
     not quite as illicit-substance heavy as some of the nighttime ones can 
     be.  Once we get him used to the idea, then maybe we can give him and 
     Da DA (Hallianan) a full-force taste of our psychedelic culture.
     
     And please, if anyone out there gets the urge to wear a hat (a *real* 
     hat, like Willie's fedora), go for it!  I think hats are great!  The 
     Chronicle's style editor was going on about how maybe people would 
     start wearing hats again because the Mayor is.
     
     Yours for a more decorative city,

Seems like PREJUDICE to PREJUDGE someone's disposition based on their
race. I actually don't know squat about the new police chief but I
don't think it's fair to bring race into the picture.

I think a posting from Brazil (.br) is pretty cool too. We need more
Brazilians around to show us how to party properly. :-) Welcome to the
list and all that... Is there a rave scene in Brazil?? I've seen news
rports on some hip hoppy DJ-type (kinda like Brazilian Bhangra)) stuff
going on in Brazil, but it didn't exactly look like a rave.

try http://thelist.com..... it's not totally inclusive, but it helps when 
looking online for stuff.

if not that, then Computer Currents is a good source with their tables.. 
call some up, see what they say..  (unlimited is a good idea, IMO)

The new police chief, Robert Lau, is of Asian-American descent.  He was born in 
Hawaii.

According to what I read in the paper, he's well-liked and has a good 
reputation.  He's said that his priorites are to clean up the royally messed-up 
911 system (good for us when something really DOES go wrong with a member of our
community), to work on discipline problems in the department (good for us when 
cops with bad attitudes visit a party), and to restore morale to the police 
force as a whole (which is said to have been damaged under Ribera, who dear old 
Frank appointed as the previous police chief).

Maybe if the guys/gals in blue felt better about their work and were held 
accountable when they got out of hand in the line of duty, things would be 
better for the club/rave scene.

The new deputy police chief, by the way, is African-American.  I believe he's 
half of one of the most effective homicide investigation teams on the SF force. 
So, we've got a guy who wants to clean up bad attitudes of the force, and a guy 
who has really done some real work against real crimes in the city.  Sounds 
pretty good to me.  Heck, I figure it can't be any worse than it was before.

Hey, it's an idea,

Laura

Da Mayor is what Willie calls himself.  The night of his big win, he had 
a hat that read "DA MAYOR".  He also pointed to it and said it.  I 
copped the term from the man himself.  But hell, I'll take the props if u

Whatever, we can see that you're good at ignoring reality.  Oh yeah, just
because you are Asian does not make you an expert on anything but your
family or yourself.  I was not aware that you are the spokeman for all
Asians, nor was I aware that you could make a racist statement as you did
being who you are.  No matter, racist come in all flavors and sizes.  You
can even find racist against one's own race.  Sometimes known as
self-loathing or hatred.  As for the number of Asians you or I know, you
really don't know how many Asians I do know, or don't.  I'll give you the
benefit of the doubt and say that you know more.  But that certainly does
not make your comments any less racist than they were.  You cast a
stereotype on your own, you're still a racist.

As for me being PC, you're actually bordering funny.  Get your facts straight:
-I voted for Jordan in '92.
-I supported Jordan on the list.
-I have vehemently supported the police of SF.
-I have voted for a Republican every now and then.
-I am far from being PC.  If you knew me, which you don't, you'd know that.

You were not able to adress any of the facts I presented to you in my post.
Understanding power structures and understanding how they play into
politics is important.  You should know know that politicans, and political
appointess have only one color, GREEN.

As the King Of All African-Americans I declare a war.  Aww forget it, I
have better battles to fight than engage with the imaginary spokeperson of
all Asians.  I was elected by ALL African-Americans to do my job.  Were
you?

Oh no, I plan on being here fighting the good fight in the name of ALL
African-Americans, who by secret ballot, elected me as thier King.  Being a
King requires that I ignore those of a lower station, like yourself, and
keep myself above the fray of the common folk.

With that said, I am glad that you have exposed a great truth: You are
misinformed, bigoted, AND racist.  I would strongly suggest to my Asian
brethern who MAY have elected you, that they reconsider their choice in
representation, and send you back to your home, where you can consider your
thoughts over warm beer and The Newt Gingrich Christmas Show.

You can stay now.  I've re-instated your priveledges so that ye might learn.

Later 0n d00d,
John

I went to it...  DJ's sucked,  but played a huge variaty of music from
Grateful dead,  hip hop,  techno, disco.  No beat mixing of course,
at first,  people just schmoosing around,  then towards the end,  everyone
went berserk on the dance floor.   People were trying to throw those little
"Glo loops" up onto the arms and legs of "Angels" hanging from the ceiling.

Met the Yahoo people,  very interesting,  they were quite intregued in
meeting me.   Met a lot of the girls I know from my earlier MacWorld
encounters,  and of course all the "Mac weenies".

Saw some pretty awsome shit,  especially "Roastery" a new Hot Java language
for the Mac  (Yay!!  - Not under license from Sun).

Tommorrow night,  I'll be at the "Be-in" and if I can scarf up an invite,
I'll try to make the Exploratorium thingie,  but I'll prolly keep my brain
entertained at the Be-In all night.   Don't know if I want to spend a
whoppin $35 for the "Queers" thingie on Sat night.   I sure hope there
will be something better this Sat.   Nothing in the Calander yet..

I went to a "Digital Queers" party 2 years ago,  then it was $25 and thats
when Robin Williams talked.   He was funny,  cracking gay related jokes and
such.   Music then Sucked...  DJ was really bad... no beat mixing,  lots of
annoying breaks in the music.   You'd think that after paying so much for a
party (That ends at 3 am) you would at least get a good DJ line up.

I have been called many things in my life, but this past flurry has left me
rather puzzled with some of the latest words used to describe me:
PC, liberal, reactionary, censor...

Gawd the list does go on.  What bothers me is that there is really no sense
of history.  If there were, certainly I would not be called these things.

In brief, I want people to AT LEAST be correct if your gonna label me
something, so I'm providing a list of words I think best describe me, with
reasons that they do/don't apply:

PC - Doesn't apply.  Please remember, during the Gulf War (yes it HAS been
that long folx), I called for the US to act like the Great Roman Empire and
be the policeman to the world. Charge for services rendered military or
otherwise (I have a fascination with Rome and all her 600+ year glory). Not
exactly all warm and fuzzy as you thought.  I also voted for Jordan in '92,
had breakfast with Jeb Bush (he is an associate), and hung around some of
the most redneck politicians in Florida for months on end (required for
being a congressional page in my home state of Florida).  Machiavelli is
good reading.  So is Sun Tzu.

Liberal - Doesn't apply.  No politcal label applies.  I am an extreme wishy
washy moderate.  I've voted for Repubs, Demos, Peace & Freedom,
LaRouheites, you name it, I've voted for it.  I just plain love to vote!

Censor - Doesn't apply.  I am the one who declared that parties are far
from being hedonistic enough for my tastes.  I have also tried to get
people to act politically, challenging the structure of SF, through voting,
to make the city more open and receptive to us, the dance culture
community.  Couldn't do that being a censor.  Why would I want to censor my
constituents, crackerjacks?  I have also defending the rights of the stinky
to smell, or not smell as the case may be.

Racist - Impossible.  A non-livable solution.  Even I do not use this word
lightly.  I always challenge racist thought and deeds.  If it can be
spoken, it can be challenged.  If anything can be acted out, then it can be
stamped out (BTW - Lynchings have occurred in THIS country in '95.  We
ain't all that, all the time...).  Nope, no time to hate, some things are
not worth having around. Racism is regressive.  I believe in progress.
Keep it above ground, so it's easier to dismantle and destroy.  Always take
strong action against racism, it's the only way to eliminate it (if it
survives, the human race, in the long term, cannot).  Besides, my family
structure doesn't allow for much room here (GeoffW, can I get a witness?)
so.


Some Recommended Terms - Sanctioned, by the King, for use by you and yours:

Reactionary - Always.  Push any one of my buttons and I explode (some would
say vomit or shit, but you get the point).

Hot Headed - Does apply.  But at least I've enrolled in a 12 step program
to correct the problem.  Hey, I'm much better than I was a couple of years
ago,  read the archives and see.  In 2 more years, I'll be completely
cured, completely happy, and completely plain.

Stubborn - Does apply.  Let's face it, when you're the King Of All
African-Americans, after a while the position gets to you and you think
compromise is below your station.  But let it be said now, that as King, I
have been wrong on more than one occasion.  That's all you get.

Wrong - Who isn't?  I have been wrong on occasion, even on two occasions.
Even I am not spared from making mistakes.  It's rare, but it does happen.

Well Informed - Yes, and you?

Asshole - Like you, I have one.


Yep, that covers it.  Please add more and mail me with a revised list if
you wish.  Winner will be drawn at random, prizes to be announced later.

One other thing:  I have really gone off on a minority here on the list of
late, and in the interest of peace I want to extend my hand (only) of
friendship to the well-smell imparied.  I think that the stinky, the funky
ones, you know, the ones who have the "funk of 10,000 years" have a right
to be as stinky as they want to be.  I would almost die defending their
right (in as much as I would die smelling them).  I have never, and will
never ask promoters to ban the stinky.  Instead I have offered my own brand
of help.  You see, it's all about inclusion, even with those who you
disagree  with on the olfactory tip.  I am all about euqal rights for
everyone; from the well heeled to the well crusted. A censor I could never
be!

Let us ALL dance in peace.

Ok, I've had my fun.  Apple gave me the day off to go to MacWorld and
listen, first hand, to the rumor mill gone amuck.  Will enjoy myself there
today, maybe even make a purchase or two.  Go to Cha, Cha, Cha's for lunch,
then head home for drinking fun.  Oh, my terrbile work week (actually had
to put in a solid 12 yesterday, yuch!).  So, maybe I'll see some of you
there.  I will be the black guy walking around.  You can't miss me ;).


Peace out & :),
John

hey folx, just 'cause someone makes what one or more members of the
  list mite consider a racist remark does NOT mean they are necessarily
    a racist;
don't forget we all say the wrong thing sometimes, and namecalling isn't
  always a productive solution

are you talking about spundae?
please dont use derrodatory (got a fucked up key pad) derrogatory terms 
when you are refering to gays and lesbians..they have every right to have 
a club for themselves or at least a place where they are safe and can dance.
yes maybe the price is steep but look back at history and think of all 
the clubs which guided house to where it is now and see how many of them 
are primarily gay/lesbian clubs....
excuse my ranting...

hello all-
i've been gone for christmas break, and just recently got my e-mail acess
back.  i was looking foreward to coming back to this list, but with the
flood of bickering, i'm not so sure.  might i make a suggestion-

        1) when a discussion seems to be involving only 2 or 3 people, why
don't you take it private to spare the multitudes who have demonstrated that
they are no longer interested?  i have been involved in 1 or 2 arguements
over sfraves and have been slammed for keeping private business public.  i
promisee, if i want to be involved in a discussion, i will jump in quickly,
and not after the re: re: re: re: train fills the subject description of the
message.

        2) let us remember about infighting within a group.  people are
frightened of raves, ravers, and what we do through media mis-information,
closed-mindedness, whatever.  as a group that has a tendency to do illegal
things every once-in-a-while, we must stand much more united that we appear.
if we are not united, we will fall under the pressure of fear, police, laws,
and all the other things that stand in the way of a good rave.  i am losing
faith that some of the people on this list would be nice to each other if
they met on a dance floor.

thanks for listening to my ramblings, and even if i have not met you,
CONSIDER YOURSELF HUGGED AT THIS VERY MOMENT!

peace, love, and hugs-

Hats are the greatest way to express yourself (next to dancing, of course) --
People call me the hat woman because I collect vintage and odd hats and wear
them as often as possible.  So I look forward to seeing more great hats out
there at parties and on the street -- and look for me - my latest is a crazy
wedding-cake looking affair of pink tulle and white flowers circa 1962 that I'll
most likely wear to Chrysalis Saturday, and I'll have my leopard top-hat on
tonight at the Digital Be-in (a MacWorld event) -- so express yo-self.... da
dada dada ....  and if Willie Browninspires more people to put their
self-expressions on their heads... thank you willie!

I agree here.  But, I think even though we cannot make 
assumptions about someone because of their race, it is still cool that 
these people of color were appointed.  I have no way of really knowing, 
but maybe they are the best peeps for their respective jobs.  Maybe 
previously they never could have a chance to prove it, because of 
their ethnicities and the prejudices of those in positions to appoint 
them.

Right on, I know that there are many many more people on this list who 
are not the core posters (not things you hang:).  I wonder how many of 
them are intimidated to post because of the intolerance that is 
sometimes (not too frequently) shown on this list.

I'm not so much intimidated as I am saddened by the fact that people have
more of a tendency to be reactionary as opposed to responsive to postings.


Communication is communication whether you are talking via email or
one-on-one in the chill lounge or dance floor.  A thought expressed either
through the gesture of a hand movement when one is dancing in a trance or
through the output of a keyboard carries the same energy and impact.

We, who have the ability to define our reality through language and action
need to be conscious of that fact.  Our generation, our culture, is
re-awakening to the reality that we exist in a multi-dimentional universe.


One of the most important gifts bestowed upon us is the ability to
communicate.  In order to make the most of our existence, I feel that we
must also be able to communicate and contemplate in a multi-dimensional
mode, translating that non-linear reality to present time and space in a
way conducive to understanding by those who share the present time and
space.  We must break away from our linear, industrialized, conditioning
patterns, in order to proceed to a reality that is conducive to our
evolution.

It could not hurt any of us if we all took a bit more time to ponder the
concepts and challenges put before us, to look at such things with the
care, decency and dignity that the persons those ideas came from deserves.
Ultimately, those very same ideas and that very same person is but a
reflection of ourselves.

With love at the speed of light,

Tigger

the late 80's, later to be exported to england where it was tweaked and 
worked with to come back to SF around 1990. (?)

According to my computer, on Wed, 10 Jan 1996, SDream shared:

But who do you think is better at kissing the mayor's ass... us or the 
cops?  The cops work for him, and they're used to following stupid orders 
given by self-important people.  We on the other hand, merely want to 
party free from official interference, tend to recognize people with big 
egos for what they are, and tend to be individualistic and not 
likely to take marching orders from anyone.  That gives the cops a pretty 
fat edge in any ass-kissing contest, as I see it.

Besides which, watering down our parties by trying to make them pleasing 
to the powers that be is one of the surest ways I can think of to kill 
the scene.  Putting up Willie Brown signs may not be 
much of a watering down, but if it's done to buy us protection, you can 
be sure that other requests for payment of various kinds will follow...

I recently heard a story about Sir Winston Churchill which may or may not 
be true, but is certainly instructive.

Mr. Churchill was at a party (probably not a rave), talking to a 
well-known society beauty.  "Madam," he asked her, "Would you sleep with 
me for five million pounds?"  "Well!" She looked away blushing, "We would 
have to discuss the terms, of course..."  "Would you sleep with me for 
five pounds?"  "Absolutely not!" the lady responded angrily.  "What kind 
of woman do you take me for?"  "We've already established that," 
Churchill rejoined.  "We are now merely haggling about the price."

Much love,

        I would like to make a suggestion, and I stress that that is all
this is, not a criticism.  About the numerous flame wars that have taken
place: Email is a great and powerful tool, but it is not a great medium for
having constructive discussions when people fundamentally disagree on
certain issues (Jesus, I sound like a politician, don't I.  Oh, well!)
When there is no immediate resonse or contact it is much easier to
exaggerate points and degenerate into name calling.  May I suggest that
when two people have a disagreement they exchange phone numbers and discuss
by voice in real time, when it is easier to remember that you are talking
with another person who deserves respect, just as you do.  I'm sorry if it
sounds like I'm on my high horse here.  This is only a respectful
suggestion.  Peace.

	that is, he parks his ferarri on the lawn.

	the man lives incredibly extravagantly.  he is always

	well i am in the other camp... analog is my true love.

	like you, i'd never try to argue *preference* :)

	anyway, there are a great deal of rackmount analogs
	coming out these days, fully implimented with midi.
	the only one i can think of that is new are by
	studio electronics... but there are many others.
	perhaps steve can share his insights...

	and the matrix1000 has good midi implimentation.
	i can control all functions of each patch with the
	driver we have for our wbl4014 macintosh midi sequencer.

WHAT!?  Are you serious!!??  Is Spundae going to be $35+?  FORGET IT!  I 
say, if that's the case, we organize an impromptu, by-the-water rave that 
night in protest.  Seriously, does anyone know how much Spundae is going to be?

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Recently I mentioned to some of you about a ISP called Liberty. Well
after doing some quick & careful research, I would like to say that ISDN is
the way to go hands down, no contest.

        Why crusie the Net at 14.4 or 28.8 when you could have your own
parttime digital line from PACBell for about $25/month local flat rate, long
distance additional, and cruise the Net at a minimum of 56kbps, and a
maximum of 112kbps, virtually T1 speed.

        ISDN(Internation Standard Digital Network)

        Initial Cost:

        ISDN Device(Motorrola Bit Surfer Pro, CompUsa Price $399.00)
        PACBell said this was the device they thought was the best, and
recommended it.

        ISDN Provider(Internex of Santa Cruz) $30/month for 30 hours of B1

        access(56kbps) or $30/month for 15 hours of B1/B2 access(112kbps),
plus         
         $1.25/hour after that.

        Get your equipment, place your order with the phone company, and a
week or two later you able to do Full Digital Connectivity from your
desktop. With the right equipment your able to do A/D, like hook your analog
phone, fax, answering machince and/or modem ...etc. Which means from a voice
stand point that if you call another digital customer you can do
simaltaneous voice,&  data transmission, on virtually noise free lines.

        I will be installing this service at my residence shortly and be
happy to let anyone know whats it's like. See ya in a digital future, later
analog......

        

31 seconds & we're going for auto-sequence start...........................
see ya's in space......4321.........darknes^2 out>>>>>>>>____........

  Willie Brown posters on party doors ???

  I can't help but think of early Jews putting goat's blood crosses on 
their doors to be passed over by a wrathful God ( As if the omniscient one
wouldn't already KNOW who's inside )....

Now maybe if we combine blood crosses, voodoo dolls, shaman rattles AND
Willie Brown posters the police will fear to enter.... ;-)

If you live in SF you might want to check out my new company Virtual Sites
we offer LIMITED ISDN for a flat rate of $50 per month but it comes

Truely if you have ISDN you wont want to go back.  You might also want to 
check out other companies other than InterNex (their not bad, I actually am
a co-founder but I've deployed a couple of other companies' ISDN

Yes and no.  Pac Bell realizes more people serious about Web surfing will be 
going ISDN, and for that reason they're trying to raise their rates in a 
series of hikes, starting with the following:

>>  JANUARY 5, 1996 DEADLINE TO PROTEST PACIFIC BELL'S ISDN TARIFF
>>        BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION
>> 
>> 
>> -    Pac Bell Proposes huge increases in residential ISDN
>>      tariffs.  Pac Bell proposed to double the daytime metered
>>      usage rate, and to introduce, for the first time, per minute
>>      metered charges in off-peak hours.
>> 
>> -    Deadline for Comments to California PSC is Friday, January
>>      5, 1996.
>> 
>> -    Public may file comments by fax, at (415)-703-1758.  If your
>>      fax is received by the deadline it will be accepted by the
>>      CPUC as an official protest.  Faxes may be accepted beyond
>>      the 5th, at the discretion of the Commission.
>> 
>> -    The California PUC Public Advisor also receives email at
>>      public.advisor@cpuc.ca.gov.  The status of protests filed by
>>      email is uncertain, but we are hoping that these comments
>>      will be processed by the Commission staff.  (The Washington
>>      State WUTC just announced that it will receive comments on
>>      the Washington State US West ISDN Tariff at
>>      isdn@wutc.wa.gov).
>> 
>> 
>> WHAT WILL THE RATE HIKES DO?
>> 
>> The following is from Jim Warren's excellent newsletter,
>> GovAccess (available from Majordomo@well.com), in a December 27
>> article titled "Telco Monopoly Ripoffs Begin: Pac Bell Wants to
>> Double Home, Business ISDN Rates." 
>> 
>>      Seasons Greetings! . . . on Dec 5th, Pac Bell applied
>>      to the Calif Public Utilities Commission to *double*
>>      its per-minute rates for residential and business ISDN
>>      victims, uh, subscribers -- jacking it up to 2.1-cents
>>      per minute for daytime phone use; [and adding new
>>      charges of ] 1.46-cents per minute for evening calls;
>>      [and] 0.84-cents per minute for nights and weekends. 
>>      They also propose to eliminate their current waiver of
>>      installation charges for customers who subscribe for at
>>      least a two-year term.  All sorts of other ISDN charges
>>      are also escalated, and previous benefits are
>>      eliminated or capped.
>> 
>> 
>> Dan Kegel's description of the Pac Bell rate increases is as
>> follows:
>> Centrex rates:  increasing by $8/mo.
>> Business rates:
>>     Old Each Additional Minute    New Each Additional Minute
>> Day            $.0105               $.0210
>> Evening        $.0073               $.0146
>> Night/Weekend  $.0042               $.0084
>> Home rates: same as business, but with 20 free hours of off-peak/month. 
[TAP/CPT Note, current residential tariff is
>> unmetered for evening, night and weekend use]
>> 
>> Pac Bell's proposed increases are clearly an attempt exploit its
>> monopoly power.  The practical result of the rate hike will be an
>> extreme limiting of residential ISDN as a popular option for
>> Internet access.
>> 
>> 
>> WHAT YOU CAN DO.
>> 
>>      You may send faxes to the California Public Utilities
>> Commission that will be filed as official protests to this action
>> if received by close of business in California on January 5,
>> 1996.  The CPUC Public Advisor's voice number if you have any

>>                                 
>>                          (415)-703-1758
>> 
>> On the cover of the fax as well as in the heading of your faxed
>> protest letter, you should also reference the docket number:
>> 
>>                           A95-12-043.
>> 
>> The protests should be addressed to:
>> 
>> Public Advisor's Office
>> California PUC
>> 505 Van Ness Ave or 107 S. Broadway
>> San Francisco CA 94102 Los Angeles CA 90012

Hey all!

Well looks like Chrysalis on saturday is gonna be the soup du jour for 
me, was wondering who else is gonna be there so I can meet some of you 
that I haven't met before!  Like I posted about FMR last week (but alas 
never got out of my house cause of all the troubles), I'll be wearing a 
shirt with a familiar design on the front, it's a big purple t-shirt, 
and I'll be wearing black velvet pants with it.  So let me know who's 
gonna show!

Love

shawna

Sorry for the confusion.

A)ISDN is *NOT* flat rate. You pay  $70 install fee and have to make a 
two year commitment otherwise you are looking at over $200. Also Pac Bell 
is petitioning the PUC(Public Utilities Commision) to raise the rates.

B)Max possible speed is 128kbs.

You also need a special serial card to handle the I/O if you go with an 
external box. A 16550 will not cut it if your provider is truly running 
at 64/128k. We just got a Livingston 5 BRI card here which truly runs at 
those speeds(no external cabling for it to go through) and the 3com's 
barf above 38.4k, while the BS Pro's will do 57.6k. So my company is 
making a card. Should be out in a month.

ISDN is o.k. but I would wait until the PUC's ruling before running out 
and signing up.

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        It is now from PACBell, and until the PUC makes their decision.
PACBell is waiveing the setup fee, but call & find out for yourself.

        I was told the correct 16550s or ? with the FIFO buffer that
actually works will run these devices reliably up to the next multiple above
56kbps.

About the only thing in the house/techno vein I have that seems to have
a Brazilian origin is a 12-incher on Columbia (!) from a guy named
only Heitor (good Brazilian name, that), with a track called Ligeirin,
which has a combo of Brazilian and soukous (West African) influences.
I played it at the last Atomic Dog in the Oakland Coliseum parking
lot during last year's Grateful Dead Mardi Gras show :)

Oh yeah, there's also the Jam & Spoon remix (not to mention the
amazingly weird original) of Yello's "Just Say Yes To Another Excess,"
which has some nonsense voiceovers about the Amazon :) :)

16550s vary quite a bit.  They're pretty marginal at 57.6 or 64K actual
throughput, from what I've heard.  There *is* a 16650 now, I believe.
A longtime acquaintance of mine from the Oregon Department of Energy,
Steve Baker, was writing about this in a recent issue of Unix Review,
but I don't have it handy.

Serial = ugh.  Why don't we move comm over to parallel and SCSI where
it belongs?

This is a good point, I would also recommend when repling to the E-mail do not 
do a Carbon copy to SFRaves, just respond to that person. I fell if something 
has too many contraversial(ms) opinions I try not to reply or answer them 
because 8 of 10 times it will turn into a flame war. Not that each person 
opinion is better then the others, it's just some people might have strange 
feelings about something and when someone doesn't agree they might feel hurt or 
something,

        I would like to make a suggestion, and I stress that that is all
this is, not a criticism.  About the numerous flame wars that have taken
place: Email is a great and powerful tool, but it is not a great medium for
having constructive discussions when people fundamentally disagree on
certain issues (Jesus, I sound like a politician, don't I.  Oh, well!)
When there is no immediate resonse or contact it is much easier to
exaggerate points and degenerate into name calling.  May I suggest that
when two people have a disagreement they exchange phone numbers and discuss
by voice in real time, when it is easier to remember that you are talking
with another person who deserves respect, just as you do.  I'm sorry if it
sounds like I'm on my high horse here.  This is only a respectful
suggestion.  Peace.

ISDN is yesterday's technology.  Telcos are currently testing
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) technology which can
run over existing copper telephone circuits, and can provide
6 Mbps, 46 times the speed of 128 kbps ISDN BRI data lines, without 
interrupting your regular telephone service on the same wire.  

Also, cable modems will soon give us bandwidth over our coaxial
cables that will also blow ISDN away.

But, yeah ISDN is available right now, and if my employer offers me it 
for free I'd be happy to take it.

Hello Everyone,
I am new on the list, I am from up north about 40 miles.  I have been
listening to Garth for awhile, but just recently I justed actually started to
go raving.  The first rave I went to was the last Gathering (Anniversary).  I
had the best time.  I was amazed how they could have put that party together.
Music, atmosphere, the positive vibes everywhere you turned.  It was very
refreshing.  The only thing was the lack of water.  I survived though=].  I
couldn't have asked for a better time.=]  I then went to Origin New Year's
and was kinda disappointed that is was so tiny (wharehouse).  I still had a
good time, but I thought the location wasn't well thought out.  That place
would have been great if it was in the summer, and if you could hear the
music better outside, but that was not the case. Actually, it was pretty nice
out that night, but you could only hear the music really good if you were in
the crowded wharehouse.  I couldn't even wiggle a little without bumping into
somebody.  I have not gone to any other party's yet since New Year's and I am
currious to know if any others are as excellent as The Gathering or if I was
just struck by luck?I am sure there are, but how often?  I have not seen
anything on the calendar for tommorow night (friday), does anyone know of
anything? 
One more thing,  I have lost a great tape by Garth, called House Nation.  I
have been trying to get a hold of one or a copy of one for a long time, but
have had no luck.  Can anyone help me???  

Pam

You are correct and don't forget SDSL. But it took 10-15 years since the 
technology was invented(ISDN) for it to make any inroads in the consumer 
market. And current reports of ASDL measure the effective range in 
hundreds of FEET. Not exactly something that is going to be a market 
viable product any time soon.

One-way bandwidth in any implementation I have heard about. And remember 
this comes from the people that have been saying interactive TV and 500 
channels were right around the corner five years ago. How's your signal? 
My stinks. I can't even get surround sound to kick in properly which 
seems to work fine on VCR tapes going through the same cable on my end. 
Cable companies response? Signal seems to be within specs. You want these 
people doing ISP service?

Here is what PacBell is charging me monthly for a home ISDN line:

SDS Home ISDN - Basic Package	       15.00
and the usual taxes, etc.

The rates for local calls are:

Monday-Friday, 8am-5pm: $0.03 for the first minute, $0.01 each add'l minute
All other times: No charge

I live in Walnut Creek so it may be different in other Bay Area cities
(but I would doubt it).  I use it mostly during off-peak hours
and my bill is usually around $50.00 a month.

> B)Max possible speed is 128kbs.

As long as your communication device supports aggregating of channels.
If you use compression the throughput can be higher. My compression ratio
usually runs around 2:1.  (mostly telnet and web traffic).

I'm not sure if ISP's provide this, but I use my ISDN line with an
ethernet bridge.  The ISDN box plugs into my ethernet card.  My
PC thinks it's just another machine on the company network.  I have
my own IP address and run Netscape, etc. directly.  Definitely nice.

Yeah, with the new rate increases and getting rid of the "free" 
local calls at night, it will be a LOT more expensive.  My average
bill will go up to $200 from $50 with the new rates.

Why go with telephone lines?  There is actually a kind of modem that works 
with cable -- that's right, TV cable lines.  You get AMAZING throughput.  
The problem is, the modem is about the size of a computer itself, and it 
costs about $1000.  Some of the guys here think that, eventually, cable 
companies will also begin providing super high speed Internet access.  The 
cable is already laid, the circuits are already in place, it's just a matter 
of time before they get the size and cost of the modems down.

Sorry for the cross post everyone.

Does anyone know anything about the Yamaha QX21 midi Sequencer.   I know
someone who is selling one for $50, and I want to know what it is capable
of, and what the memory is like.  I know it doesn't have a disk drive, so I
wonder how limited the memory is.  Please let me know if you have any info.
Thanks, and again sorry for the cross post.

I have noticed that people are hesitant to post directly to another 
person.  I have done that and received no reply (but I still do it for 
off topic posts).  I think (my opinion) 
that a lot of it is ego-centered.  Everyone wants *everyone else* to hear 
what they are saying (a lot more dramatic) more than just face the one 
person.  (See, I'm doing it right now :) ha ha :)

I think I will shut up now and spare ya'all.
cheers-n-such,

House progressed from disco, mainly played at gay dance clubs in Chicago
and New York (early 80's).  Teechno grew up in Detroit, being a blend
of Chicago House, Kraftwerk, P-Funk, gospel, etc.  Detroit Techno's
first outlet was in the house clubs in Chicago, as that audience was
most receptive to repetitve electronic dance music.  Another strain of
Detroit Techno was more blended with New York Hip Hop & Electro, and
never really got big, but is being looked back on now as years ahead of
it's time.

England took Chicago House (often refered to as acid house) and Detroit
Techno, added all their drugs, and exported it back to the States.  Now,
kids here read about 10,000 person "Summer of Love" festival parties,
and they all rush to check out this latest crazy music from England...

Of course, there's a lot more to the story...

	Several years ago someone told me about a prototype set-top box they had 
with four connections: cable for downlink and TV, telco for uplink, and 10baseT 
for the computer.  Obviously not yet a consumer item (but wait till Bill gets 
serious with NBCfn).  However I seem to recall the current experimental 
interactive TV implementations use a similar model.

	BTW re ISDN rates, don't forget Centrex service.  In this model you and 
your ISP are on two extensions of the same line, so you are always connected.  
The only people I know who use this run their own WWW sites.

	Copper sucks, gimme glass.  So fast I don't care if its serial, and it 
works over real distances.  SONET is real, its now, and its expensive :(.

Has anyone heard anything about EON on Saturday night?
I am thinking about heading down to the city and EON sounds 
like a fun one. Super DJ Dimitry is going to be there and he 
is sooo good. 

Let me know any info. Thanks!:)

You wrote:  ...when repling to the E-mail do not do a Carbon copy to SFRaves,

& You:   ...Email is a great and powerful tool, but it is not a great medium
for having constructive discussions...

Let us remember the goal of this board... now just what was that?   I am 2
days new to sfraves, and quite happy about joining!:) the discussions I see
taking place renew my enthusiasm, and give my idealistic hope for humanity a
direly needed boost.  These discussions, or flames, or whatever they are,
serve a great purpose.  The point is that we ARE talking about the issues, in
an open forum.  This is benneficial to not only the participants, but to all
the me's out there putting our gears of thought in motion.  Political,
spiritual, social, whatever!  Never be afraid to express yourself freely and
honestly!  (not at all saying the prev. posts suggest otherwise)

PROBLEM: Where things get a bit grey, is determining what means of address we
should use, and once an issue expressed, and it  becomes a personal
discussion, at what point should it be taken out of the main stream of idea
exchange and put into a more private environment, (i.e. direct e-mail, phone
conv., etc.).
SOLUTION?:  As I said, I'm quite new to the whole proccess, but it sure seems
that there should be some way of giving subscribers more of a choice of
distibution and reception of postings.  For example, having several "halls"
withing sfraves, each having a specialty interest: music, political, social,
personal etc.,.   My idea also involves the user being able to filter the
posts he recieves, and somehow being able to "tag" a particular discsussion,
so that one can chose to follow that discussion, and recieve all posts
concerning it.  Now I suppose it's possible that all this exists, and has for
some time, and that I'd be better off reading my manuals than writing this.
 And I suppose it'salso possible that this post may be a far too dragged out
way of saying "Hello sfraves, my names is Steveo, and I like to talk!"  But
hey, this is the type of free expression I'm talkin about. : )
Fill me in if anyone can relate, but it's your decision on what method to
use. : )
P.S. Christmas was grand, as was the last night of december, but Martin
Luther King was a man to remember! 
Love & life,
Steveo

     Rick,
     
     Shame on you--infecting an entire population of ~300 ravers with one 
     virtual kiss.  So much for the love we spread while raving.  Be 
     careful and next time get our consent ;)
     
     Hugs, (but no swapping spit!)

     I'm another person who's very interested in the dj line up for EON but 
     don't know much about the promoters and what they've done in the past. 
      Anyone out there care to fill us in?  
     
     Since I'm working Monday, I might just go to this instead of Spundae.  
     And yeah, I know I'm passing up the +vibe+ of Chrysalis but sometimes 
     I just gotta freak!
     
     Cheers!

Has anyone heard anything about EON on Saturday night?
I am thinking about heading down to the city and EON sounds 
like a fun one. Super DJ Dimitry is going to be there and he 
is sooo good. 
     
Let me know any info. Thanks!:)

Well, we've met before Shawna, and I shall be there with Wayne and my 
friends Melanie and Omar. Hope to meet some more new sfravers - as usual, 
I shall be wearing my laminate - and  hey, I've noticed some of you 
haven't been wearing yours!  Sure we know quite a few of us in the 
internet circle, but there are still other newbies who haven't met us 
yet.  Don't get worn out on wearing them yet - they are so hip and cool 
looking!  :P See you all Saturday!

love,
Amy

For a while, i started noticing that many DJs are really different ppl. At least while they talk about music and stuff. Some have huge egos, I guess...

Do you guys agree ??? or not??? Did you actually meet DJs who were very cool and nice?? 
or were idiots and egomaniacs??? 

:)
DIRCEU - I am a DJ too, but I don't know if my ego is big - Don't have a ruler :)

There is a party going on in Sacramento this Saturday called SYNTHETIC.
DJ's include:

Graeme
FLX (hiwaii)
Jon Williams
Wizard
SHO

Ambient space

Rig-a-tony
Fil
Rick
Jonny

The only problem is I don't have an information number which makes this
information pretty useless.  I'm playing ambient there, but my contact
hasn't returned my call yet.  I'll post the number when I get it.  I figured
that if anyone from the Sac area didn't want to drive all the way to the
city, they would know they had an alternate choice.

Hope to see someone...anyone there.

Rick

Not 100% pure but I am pretty sure:

Promoters:  Oogga Boogga people (originally from Sac town)

Place:  East Bay

Cost:  The super star line up speaks for itself 
       (that is an insane line up, just hope they all show)

     Thanks for the info.  I hope the promoters deliver too! (Flight 
     permitting from back East, too since it's beginning to snow over there 
     again.)  I just find it interesting that Frankie Feliciano,  DJ Pierre 
     and Barry Weaver aren't lined up anywhere else during the weekend, or 
     maybe I just haven't seen any flyers for other parties like Club 
     Universe, etc.
     
     Am I jaded or what?!  (This is a rhetorical q)
     
     Have a great weekend, all!
     
     Diane

Yeah but that's only going out from the hub, the back channel is still around
128K so it's great for serving "consumers" but not if each individual 
wants to run their own webserver.

For most of the systems that are currently dsigned, the same thing, they are
Asymetric, that is lots of bandwidth going out to you, not so much coming 
back from you, buyer beware of asymetric systems is what I say.

Dear all,

Some dj's have MONSTROUS EGOS.  I carry my 
ego-meter everywhere I go and some individuals are off the scale. I will 
name no names...at the moment.  Read on!

Some observations:

Such as:  DJing is an art, and most dj's are intensely passionate about 
it.  Music obsesses them.  They love it and they have strong opinions 
about it.

When you're doing some kind of art, you have to have standards to 
evaluate your work and other people's work.  And if you happen to live up 
to your standards, then you might end up with an excellent self-opinion.  
In some people, simple self-confidence comes off like arrogance.  

What most fascinates me the art of dj'ing is how the dj picks the records 
to play.  I've listened to hours and hours of party tapes, and even when 
I wasn't actually at the party, the music re-creates the setting in my 
mind.  Some dj's have a gift at creating mood and atmosphere.  In my 
mind, Felix and Ronan are masters at this.

If you agree that dj'ing is an art, and if you think that art is about 
self-expression, then you have to agree that dj's use other people's 
creations to express what's in their own heart.

This to me is the reason we have a bit of a dj cult going on in the 
scene.  You can't separate the man or woman from the musical experience 
he or she creates.  If you love a set that someone plays, then on some 
level, you love that person, as well.

Consider this:  the music you hear at a rave you might never hear again 
in any other setting, except maybe at another rave or on a set tape.  You 
may hear something that transforms your attitude toward music, toward 
life, toward love, toward yourself.  And you might never know what that 
song is called or who created it in the first place.  Knowing this makes 
me sad but exalted, too..because then the music belongs to itself and you 
can never really possess it.  Even the dj who owns the record doesn't 
really possess it, because he didn't create it.  And the music is nothing 
if it isn't played.  It's just a plastic platter with one long groove 
going around and around.

love,

Ann

The question makes about as much sense as asking "Do some programmers
have big egos?"  Of course *some* do.  But I would disagree with
the message implied by the question.  Thinking about all the
DJs I've met, I would say that on average they have smaller egos
than the average human.  Just my own perception.

HERE"S THE NUMBER FOR THIS PARTY (I PICKED UP THE FLYER YESTERDAY)
1-800-989-9998    PIN 6631

RICK WROTE:

There is a party going on in Sacramento this Saturday called SYNTHETIC.
DJ's include:

Graeme
FLX (hiwaii)
Jon Williams
Wizard
SHO

Ambient space

Rig-a-tony
Fil
Rick
Jonny

The only problem is I don't have an information number which makes this
information pretty useless.  I'm playing ambient there, but my contact
hasn't returned my call yet.  I'll post the number when I get it.  I figured
that if anyone from the Sac area didn't want to drive all the way to the
city, they would know they had an alternate choice.

Hope to see someone...anyone there.

Rick

Yep, it's hard to miss the egos on some of our favorite DJs -- my theory is that
it's a little like the sports star phenomenon - someone who is a regular person
at heart has a special talent or gift that makes people treat them differently -
and  before you know it, they start to get that oh-so-swelling head.  I think
there's also a dose of shyness that is built into the nature of lots of artists
too, who may communicate better through their art than through social
interaction.

You've got to respect people who can make music that can reach all the way into
our soul, but it sure would be nice to have some of our favorite music-spinners
lighten up and BE FRIENDLY.  After all, without us, their music would be
unappreciated -- I mean, can you hear the sound of a groovy beat in the woods,
if there's noone there?  It surely wouldn't be the same.

So I implore all you DJs out there to remember, you can affect the vibe with
your personal vibe as well as the music.  I know there's lots of groupies out
there who may be a little annoying at times, but that comes with the territory
-- how nice to be looked up to that way.

So, DJs, share your music and your beats, but also share your smiles (ooooo
Thomas does that so well!) and your friendliness with us, and you'll get it back
in kind.

hello!
i have been reading some posts on the different kinds of accounts lately, 
wishing that i understood all the jargon. perhaps a message could be 
composed by someone really in the know, defining some terms: isdn, ppp, 
slip, bandwith, etc. im sure i am not alone in my ignorance, and because 
1) these posts have been public, and 2) the info would really benefit all 
concerned, some clarification seems in order. i know it is not directly 
rave related, but it is important none the less.

thank you!

kevin
:)

p.s. even recommending some books would be nice, if either time and 
message length are an issue...

Hi Sean,
I am into that DJ line up myself.  They are really good.  Although, I need to
broden my horizons too.  Can you do over the phone orders with Solid Grooves?
 I usually do that at Housewares,  so I don't have to drive all the way to
the city for a single tape.  It is nice. 

Thanks, 
Pam

The whole letter takes up about as much size as one Web page with a few 
pictures.  Compared to that, the bandwidth used for text is very small,
especially given the thousands of binaries posted every day to every 
news server on the planet.

If we want to speed up the net, we should disseminate Web browsers that
make pulling in graphics optional and off by default, so you have
to click on the picture to download it.

hi everyone, i'm writing all the way from Philadelphia... just wanted to say
hello to all the sfravers, especially the ones who know me!  I was out there
this summer and hung out a lot at the Sunset parties, and i hope i'll be
moving there soon! :)

on a different note, i'm looking for a song ID... I know it's called Indian
Vibes and it's by Mathar, but I need to know the record label that puts it
out.  This song starts out with sitars and then goes into a crazy funky
breakbeat and the sitar starts jamming out!  I heard it once in San Fran, and
only once after that at IO2 in Kentucky.  If you know the info please email
me asap!

anyway, i'll go back to observing now... :)

Agreed, one of the best things I've run into on the web is the Burning

Hey everybody!

I know I posted an abbreviated version of this here post before, but I 
left out some description of myself I want to post now!

If you're going to Chrysalis, please come give me a hug & say hi if you 
see me!  As described before, I'll be wearing my aforementioned big 
purple t-shirt (with a design a lot of you'll recognize), black velvet 
pants, & black boots.  Shoulder-length brown wavy-ish hair (that'll 
probably be in a pony-tail by the time you see me!), 5'8", medium-set.  
However, I won't have my laminate this time, as I accidentally left it 
at a friend's house.  :(   So come up & say hi if you see me!  I look 
forward to meeting some of you, & seeing again those of you I've 
already met before!


Love,
Shawna

I was NOT referring to Spundae..  I was referring to "Digital Queers",
a MacWorld fund raiser party.

It isn't much of a rave,  as 2 years ago only small partion was devoted
for dancing.   Robin Williams was the surprise speaker.

Hey gang,

	I've returned from the snowy hinterlands!  Green Bay, WI, that 
is.  Go Packers!
	I'm heading off to Chrysalis tomorrow, and this time I'm 
guaranteed NOT to flub up and completely misunderstand the map point info 
like I did last time.  I noticed that the Gateway people were extremely 
precise with all the mappoint details this time...  I can't help but wonder 
if this is in some part a response to my lamentable blubbering on their 
answering machine.  Nonetheless, it'll be a great party.
	Of course, I'll be wearing my Burger King crown and laminate, so 
please please come up and introduce yerselves.  


	see you tomorrow,


		The Whopper--Jon

The biggest problem with telecom bandwidth is that the computer world is
just now reaching the transition zone where the barrier to wider
bandwidth is no longer the capability of some DSP (and Rockwell's
seemingly bottomless ability to transcend the "theoretical limits"
to relatively good signal transmission over long-distance plain-ole
phone circuits :) but instead the properties of the transmission
medium itself, and the chaotic battle over who does what with which
wires.  Pacbell's slamming the door shut on ISDN, and I for one think
that while this is a serious mistake, it will be very hard to turn
it around.  It costs a lot less to beat Rockwell's latest/fastest
chip set (especially if you *are* Rockwell!) than to upgrade wiring,
circuit-handling hardware, switching software and perhaps most
importantly, corporate culture, to offer more than Model T type
bandwidth to the entire population.  

It will happen someday, but obviously this could have happened a decade
ago and the Baby Bells balked then, and are still balking.

Rocky and I had an interesting on-the-fly discussion of this last weekend
while he was batting around ideas with some folks on ICB about exactly
this issue.  Unless I'm quite wrong, we're going to have to live with
28.8 for a couple more years as the practical ceiling for desktop
computer connections (I know, you can do ISDN or T1 pieces or whatever,
but that requires a lot of patience, some serious bucks and even more
patience).

Lee:
seems like you saw the article in Wired 3.11, "ISDN RIP".  did you see 
the one called "Hype List" in the back?  here it is if you missed it...

ADSL
"If you think the telephone companies have the slightest idea of where 
the digital revolution is headed, take a look at their latest technology: 
Asymetrical Digital Subscriber Line.  Sure, ADSL pumps 6 Mbps over a 
phone line.  But it's a hack, a stopgap solution made from duct tape and 
bailing wire.  ADSL is asymetrical, prone to noise, and won't scale to 
higher speeds.  Maybe the cable companies- who have at least laid coaxial 
cable- will win after all." - s.g. steinberg (hype-list@wired.com)  

i know this discussion seems a little farfetched, but is it really when 
you invest in a lot of money in technology for your business and it's 
obsolete in 18 months?

Hello!
This is newbie Pam, looks like I will be going to Chrysalis.  Nothing going
on last night, stayed home and watched Basketball Diaries, great movie for
staying home and doing zilch.  I tried to think of something I have that is
pretty recognizable to wear, since I don't have a laminate, and want all you
to come and interduse yourself to me.  So here it is,  I will be wearing a
black T that says ---fuct---- on it.  It is as noticeable as a street sign.
 Find Me!!!  Shawna I will be looking.

I seem to have lost my Weekly list so could someone please either send it
to me again or give me the number for Chrysalis.
Also is anyone going to All Together Now?

Thanx,
Jon

See all you there!

I'll be with Tim (Knucklehead), Amy S, Melanie, and a bunch of our Apple
friends and their friends. Look for my black alien t-shirt. It's an alien
head inside a nuclear symbol. Also, our friend Kevin is wearing an "Alien
in the hat" shirt.

It's in a warehouse called Texas BBQ.  It's on the right.  

A friend and I will be playing live ambient in the ambient space.  The main
dance space is really nice/with great sound.  Really nice decorations.
Should be a good one.  See you there.

Hi!

I'm hanging out at an intimate gathering of friends.  We just saw off a 
couple of friends who are going to Chrysalis.  You two have fun!

Is anybody out there that would like to chat?  We are having a New Moon 
virtual rave.

The music is ambient, the fire in the fireplace is lit, and the air is 
filled with happy conversation.  Later, there will be marbling.

Love-

Ann

Dear ??

My friends are here in a nice, warm house on a hill, listening to 
Swimwear Catalog. I think that's the "group" or  whatever.

 It's very mellow, soothing and uplifting.  We 
just took a walk in a park near here.  The mist is heavy on the hill, and 
cold.

We've been dancing very slowly all night long.  It seems like the right 
way to dance in such a peaceful neighborhood.

On top of the hill near us, there's a giant white, electrically powered 
cross.  The turn it on for Christmas, and then Easter.

These times mark off the death of the old year, and the rebirth of the 
new year.

Discovering your pagan roots is such a blast.

-Ann

hello all-  (i'm at a different address, so my name like looks kinda
different.  it's matthew lanier)

one sentence- Chrysalis kicked my ass!

i don't normally rate raves, but this was by far the best rave i have ever
been at.

people- 10 smiles
music-10 smiles
vibe!- 10+smiles

the experience is summed up in one scene- in the back room where everyone
was chilling, a gentleman stood up and shouted to al of us "Appreciate
this!"  at that point the whole room started screaming ad hugging each
other.  i knew i was at the right place.

thanks to all the sfraverfamilymembers i met: amy, black adder, shawna!!
(she's a cool cat) and the 10 whose name's i don't remember.  it was the
people that mae chrysalis, not the chemicals, music, or visuals, it was you!

i met a new friend with the initials white light who is still visiting me
now, at noon the next day.  he is a very, very, very nice guy, and i
recommend people to seek him out.

as is appropriate to come after a cool rave review, i have a healing story
to share.  it was cool, and i feel different because of it.

here goes-  i went to chrysalis with a newbie friend, who immediately got
into the vibe and struck out on her own.  i was in the back room, hanging,
when i stumbled upon an sfraver whom i had wanted to meet.  we hung, we
talked, we connected, we traced, we healed, we got to know each other in
the space of about 3 hours.  this was the first time i had ever felt so
connected to another single person at a rave.  it was cool- i am still
processing it, but, after a dry spell of no raving, i now remember why i
went in the first place- the people- and it took a really cool girl to
teach me that.  Thanks!!!!!!

peace, love, and infinite happiness-

matt l.

        Chrysalis was, as usual, incredible!  This was my first sober rave,
and it fully confirmed my theory that when the vibe is that good you can
have a great time no matter what condition you're in!  By the way, could
anyone out there tell me who was spinning in the downstairs room between
about 2:15-3:00?  Thanks.  Time to go back to sleep.  Peace.

Hello,
It is me the New Newbie Pam,  I took most everyones advice on here to go to
Chrysalis.
Looks like so far, I was the only one not stoked on Chyrsalis.  It may have
just been my mood though.  I hate to be a complainer, but I thought it was
too crowded, too small, too stuffy.  And I felt nothing from nobody.  I was
dancing for little while in the back, and this one sleezy guy was rubbing me
the wrong way.  The music while I was there was O.K., but it seemed to be too
trancy.  I like it when the DJs throw in weird singing samples.  At the last
couple of parties I've been to the music grabs me and I loose complete
control of my body.  Didn't happen.  To me it was the same beat that lasted
to long.  I was there from 1:00-3:30.  Looks like this newbie will go back to
my main roots Garth, Jeno,Dan, Tony...etc. parties.  Sorry.  Maybe I am over
reacting though. I might try out another Gateway party later to come.  So I
know it was not just my mood or something. 

peace, love, and unity.

Pam

Hi all,

Morgan and Michelle got back from Chrysalis about 7, while all the rest 
of us were sleeping.  They said it was a great party, but too crowded.

We're all hanging out, and the cat is asleep on top of the monitor.  

I'm tired, but tonite we'll go to Spundae.  Doc Martin is playing, yahoo!

see you,

Ann

        Thanks for posting this. It made me realize what i loved about SF
when i was there, this type of consciousness not of how good things can be
(it had that for sure) but also a balance, realizing how good things _ARE_.
Since i returned to montreal i've been lagged (in vrave terms) and have
realized how much your environment affects you on all levels of your self.
        So this is just a little review of my time in SF over christmas/new
years, and it's taken me this long to write it not because i'm lazy but
because i didn't realize how special it was until i got back here with the
snow and negativity.
        Briefly, i went to Mos Eisley two nights, Come-Unity one night, a
coupel things here and there but the jewel on my visit was the Cybertrance
party on new years.  Wow, it was so unlike anything i've experienced before
and i loved it. I ahve seen many a goa dj and live pa but this is the party
that has really solidified my love with soem of this music and mostly the
'culture' at large. I think that goa has a lot of aspects that are quite
progressive in terms of culture and music, i loved the fact that noone
really cared how they looked at this party, nude or clothed, rich or poor,
whatever.  It seemed like everyone in teh room was jsut there for simple
but basic reasons: to enlighten themselves and to have fun and to help
other ppl have fun. Can't get more basic than that :)
        I, unfortunately, didn't get a chance to meet any sfravers while i
was there, but i look at it (along with matt's post) as further kicks in my
butt to get my life going in the direction that is best with me, that is,
move to SF.
        Like any obstacle one may encounter, one tries their best to deal
with it on their own, but sometimes we need a little help and have to rely
on outside factors. Some people (like me) have a stubborn way of not asking
for help when i need it. Well, that can only inhibit your progress through
life as we all need each other, so i'm going to get past all that and ask
for a little help if you can.
        If there's anyone on this list that is offering or is aware of an
offer of employment in the graphics/web development field, i would be
unbelievably grateful if you could pass it my way via email. This is one
obstacle that could be lessened if things fall into place. Thanks in
advance.
        Ok, to sum up my review of SF, i would have to echo that guy's
statements, because when i was planning this review, i just wanted to write
"appreciate your scene" i know it's tough, but rememebering the small
things in life that you take for granted is worth it on your personal
Happy-Meter :)

        much thanks and peace,
                brad

The DJ from 2-3:30 was John Carel. I liked the beginning of his set, but it
settled down and got kind of stale by the end. But does anybody know what
the hard, bouncy song he was playing with the whale samples and the really
short tribal vocal sample was? I was definitely enjoying that song.

John Carel rocked from ~2:30-4:00am. He is also 1/3 of Gateway Systems, the
people that put on the Chrysalis parties.

I couldn't wait to get home to post, so I'm here at Wayne's posting my review...
I had *SO MUCH FUN*!!!
Yes, it was *WAY* too crowded until around 3 - then it seemed as if half
the crowd suddenly left and there was room to dance and sufficient
circulation to keep cool.
I missed Freaky Chakra at Begin Again, so I made it a point to be right
there in the front for his entire set.  He was really good!  I had to go
upstairs and chill for about an hour after that, and by that time it was 3,
and like I said, by then the crowd had cleared out considerably just in
time for my 2nd wind that lasted me until I danced pretty much non stop til
it ended around 7:30.
I was so HAPPY!  I haven't been able to dance that late since Burning Man,
and I had thought I was getting old or something.  I was *really* happy to
stay to the end where there were muffins and juice for us weary dancers.
Solar played an amazing closing set,
Andre Lucero blew me away too.  This was definately my style of music -
really hard with A*T*T*I*T*U*D*E!!
I felt a real connection with everyone there. Pam - give it another chance
- the good vibe was *DEFINATELY* present.  And I wasn't on e to feel it.
No - it was there a big way!!

I was really suprised at the number of people there.  I had thought that
Chrysalis was still pretty small party - seems like more and more people
know what a good party is - I mean look at how much F&F has grown!

Another last positive note - I had talked a dear friend of mine to coming
in celebration of his birthday.  He was reluctant because he had never
heard of Chrysalis before or most of the dj's playing.  Well, he trusted me
and went and I think he will believe me from now on!  Thank you, Gateway,
and all involved in making this happen!

love,
Amy

How do I get off the sfraves mailing list?  I've tried what I was told when I 
signed up.  That didn't work.  I've tried what I have done on many other 
mailing lists.  That didn't work.  And I've tried suggestions from others.  
Those didn't work either.  What am I to do?  Annoy everyone in here until I get 
kicked off the list?

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        The party was v-v-v-vonderful; a great big hug, & a pat on the back
for those people who make our parties happen = >.

        Got there pretty early round 11pm, and da place was pretty empty,
with just a few good friends around to talk with. We were there about a half
hour when the place just filled up. We stayed until the music stopped around
7 - 8am.

        Freaky, John Carel & Minor Minor ripped up their respective parts of
the night. I personally thought Minor Minor was in rare/exceptional form
last night, but on the other hand I like my Techno a little bit more
cohesive, & flowing. Where last night seemed kind a cut & splice as far as
track to track went, but again & on the other hand, the diversity was a
refreshing change.

        I really liked the alters, decorations, rugs, and the way the rooms
were setup.

        I noticed one or two people getting sick last night & thought I
would offer some sound advice regarding eating and doing that favorite raver
thing with Light. 

First, never eat and then immediately indulge, this is the fastest way
possible for you to ruin your evening, as well as your friends because
they'll no doubt will have to take care of you. In general, you should wait
until your stomach is empty before indulging. So how do you know when you
stomach is empty? Usually, &  in most earthlings the process of digestion
takes anywhere from 2 - 4 hours after you've last eaten. When in doubt as to
when you've eaten last, this is usually my case, take half just to be safe. 

So why do people get sick when they do both to close together. Normally in
an empty stomach most humans absorb about 60% of the content of what's
eaten. This can vary from human to human depending on diet, content, needs
of the bod in ?, condition of stomach ...etc. So when someone mixes the two
together, to close together you actually get more potency out of it. This is
due to the fact that the other 40% that you normally don't absorb, travels
along with the food into your body. Along with that appetite suppressant
part of it trying to empty your stomach, as well as your bowels as fast as
it can. So when the body fails to accomplish this task in it's normal
fashion, & there's food still present in the stomach, and it can't go in,
guess what happens next; high velocity chucks everywhere. 

Regarding aliens like myself, we have so much acid in our stomachs the
process of digestion is usually a flash one. Where food enters the system,
hits the stomach, flash, and it's digested.

For those of you die hard ravers out there that want to approach that 100%
absorbtion mark, I will pass on to you what every doctor & health profession
has told me, stick in up your butt!!! No, I'm not kidding & neither were
they, & NO of course I've never tried it personally. The logic & medical
evidence indicates that if one does this, they won't get sick, due to this
new path of every ravers favorite indulgence, and you will approach that
100% absorbtion mark. The colons major bod function is absorbtion, that's
all that it does really, besides providing a path for fecal matter to leave
the bod, & mass peristaLsis. I still; for strictly personal reasons &
despite their(doctors) recommendation, do not recommend taking it this way,
as well as hear about anyone who does or has.

Second, the mixing of CNS & PNS depressants like Valium, Alcohol, Soma
...etc are contraindicated when indulging in every ravers favorite activity.
What does contraindicated mean, UNDER NO CONDITIONS SHOULD A HUMAN BEING BE
MIXING THESE DRUGS TOGETHER. This to is the fastest way for you not only to
ruin your evening, but most likely land yourself in the hospital,
embarrassed, & looking very foolish, if not dead or seriously injured. Note,
due to the extremely potent nature of some of every ravers favorite
indulgence, the compound know as GHB, should be either not utilized, or in
quat er to half doses initially.

Third, take a good bath before you indulge, preferably with a soft scrubbing
brush. Why you ask? Ok, approximately 40% of an average humans ability to
get rid of it's waste products is through the skin. So by taking a nice bath
before hand, you positively tweak your body waste removable system; sort a
like cleaning a filter on an HVAC unit, as well as give your body a drink,
plus feel great afterwards. Also, be kind to your body & drink penty of
something that's major content is H2O.

Fourth, you know your body better than anyone. Make conservative decisions
based on the information that you have on your bodies particulars as far as
method, mixing & dosage. If it's new to your body, take half or a quarter,
there will be penty of parties in the future for you to get blown out at.
Remember, it's suppose to be fun, & if it isn't anymore than maybe you
should stop.

Finally, please remember that many commonly used non/prescription
medications have the potential, & routinely make humans sick, while offering
them health, and comfort eg prescription narcotics like codeine,
hydrocodone, ...etc as well as most non-steroidal anti-inflammatorily like
aspirin, & motrin ...etc.

        These are just some of things I do, and I haven't been sick in
years; less the alternative intake route. Also, don't forget that I use to
live in the state of Florida where getting sick was common place & more or
less accepted. This is why we had expressions like so & so "IS ALL ATE UP"
after a night of indulging.

Dear Wayne,

	As others on this list will surely tell you, you don't need to 
defend capitalism to me of all people.  :)  I understand that making a 
profit is not necessarily bad, indeed it is the profit motive that has 
created much of what distinguishes us from Neanderthals.
	Having said that, I feel that there is a time and a place for 
everything.  I think that the phenomenon of people making a living from 
their involvement in the rave scene has tremendous potential for the 
scene, both to improve it and to destroy it.  
	In a [was!] recent message on the subject of going to breakfast with 
new friends met at parties, I talked about how bringing our rave experiences 
into other areas of our lives could result in the spreading of love and 
the vibe.  If we all could pay our way in society by contributing to 
parties in some way, this would truly make us a movement worthy of the 
name, and would open a tremendous number of new and exciting 
possibilities for us as an intentional community.
	However when only a few of us are making a living within the scene,  
I see the potential for a widening gap between the average raver and 
those in the "inner circle,",  the DJs, promoters, etc. who form mutually 
profitable relationships in the course of putting on events.
	I do not have a problem with Martin taking home some cash at the 
end of the night.  The amount involved is a factor, of course, but in 
principle I think it is acceptable, even good, that he and others should 
be financially compensated for their efforts, and I think most sfravers 
would agree that this is fair.
	Most parties search people at the door.  This always bothers me a 
little bit, because it implies a lack of trust.  It implies that I cannot 
be trusted not to bring weapons in which I would use to threaten the 
health or safety of others.  I kind of feel like when I come dressed in 
happy, fun clothing, with a smile on my face, it should be obvious to the 
security that I don't need to be searched.  Search those scowling guys in 
the bandanas over there, if you feel the need to search someone.
	So I can understand how Martin may feel at being asked to show 
how much money he takes in, and where it goes.  The implication is that 
we don't trust him enough to take him at his word.  He may feel like we 
have the right to demand an accounting of promoters like Cool World, who 
have a bad rep, but not himself, since he is "one of us," and his heart 
is in the right place.
	Hopefully Martin and others will see my request as a desire to be 
involved, which it is, and a desire see the community grow closer.  
Neither of these could possibly be motivations for wanting to search 
someone, I should point out.
	We live in an Information Age, and personally I feel that the 
more information of all types that becomes publicly available, the more 
democratic our society will be.  When you think about it, a lot of people 
and groups derive their power from possessing information that others do 
not, and in many cases they go to great lengths to keep this information 
secret in order to preserve their status and privilege.  I am not 
suggesting that this is the case with our rave promoters, but it is 
something to be aware of.  It is the reason people are so reluctant in 
general to tell others how much money they make -- on some level they 
realize that money is power, and by revealing their income and its 
source, they give up some power.  The power thus given up cannot really 
be used to hurt you, however, unless you are afraid that someone will 
come along and take your job, or if the amount or source(s) of your 
income contain reason(s) for you to be ashamed.  (The only exception I 
can think of is if you have illegal income and fear the IRS, which is a 
legitimate reason to maintain secrecy, imo.)
	On the matter of democratization, I might also point out that sfraves 
and the other regional rave discussion boards serve as powerful democratizers 
of our scene merely by being conduits for the free flow of information, and 
also by being forums where we all are more or less equal.

Thoughtfully yours,

	Reading Alex's suggestion on phoning directly rather than 
starting email flame wars reminded me of an idea I had some time ago, and 
that is an SFRAVES phone tree.  I don't know if such a thing exists or 
has been attempted before, but if so, no one has told me about it.
	Judging by all the posts from people trying to recognize 
strangers at parties, many of us are eager to get in touch with each 
other!  Of course the shyness factor may prevent many of us from calling 
each other out of the blue, but then maybe some of the shy ravers would 
appreciate being called by others who are less shy.
	Many of us can probably think of times when we needed just that 
little extra push to convince us to go out, or wanted to go somewhere but 
lacked transportation, or didn't have the confidence to go somewhere by 
ourselves, or just needed to talk to someone.  Chances are that whatever 
the problem, there was someone on the list who would have been more than 
happy to brighten our day (or night), if only we'd had their number.  A 
phone tree will also make it easier to communicate information to the list 
when we're away from our computers, by phoning another sfraver and asking them 
to post for us, and will allow us to get in touch when the list is down.  
	Anyway, rather than just talk about the need for a phone tree, 
I've decided to take it upon myself to organize one.
	Anyone who would like to be included should send me their phone 
number(s), specifying whether it/they are home, office, pager, etc.,  
along with the following information (optional): City you live 
in, name you wish to be called when called, whether you can give rides, 
and whether you would like to be called just whenever or only if it's 
something really important.  I'll compile the names & numbers and post 
them to the list.  
	I'm probably overlooking some important elements here, so feel 
free to respond to this and point out my errors.  If for some reason you 
don't want your name/number/etc. posted to the whole list but only to 
those others revealing the same information, be sure and let me know and 
I'll forward only to others on the phone tree.
	As a final note, I've also been thinking about doing a survey of 
the list, asking some questions like, How old are you? What does the rave 
scene mean to you?  Would you eat green eggs and ham?  How long have you 
been going to parties?  What was your favorite party?  Maybe even, (shudder) 
House or techno?  :)  If you would like to take part in such a survey, please 
let me know when you send me your phone info.  If you don't want to be on the 
phone tree but would like to take part in a survey, perhaps anonymously, 
let me know that.  If you have ideas for survey questions, send 'em along!
	Personally, I feel a survey would be very interesting... maybe 
the first chance a community of ravers has had to take a good look at 
itself en masse.  I think it and the phone tree could bring us much 
closer as a community, or extended family if you prefer.  Then again, 
maybe there is a real downside to a survey that I haven't thought of.  If 
there is, I'm sure someone will let me know!  :)

Practicing "family planning",
				<<< Starchild >>>

P.S. - This post is too long already, but one other brief and (mostly) 
unrelated idea I got from reading Brad's forwarded post from NE-Raves:  I 
don't have time myself to read all the mail from another rave list, but I 
sometimes wonder what I'm missing.  It would be cool if SFRAVES could have a 
designated "reader" for each of the other regional lists, who would 
forward to sfraves anything they felt was of particular interest and make a 
periodic report on what ravers on these other boards are talking about, 
as far as current topics and threads, volume of postings, etc.
	For example, an SFRAVER monitoring the Aussie rave list (Capt. 
Crunch?) might post:
	This week there were 200 posts to the Aussie rave list.  The 
three [completely fictional] topics with the most posts were: 
	(1) The Expressions of Love massive in Sydney
	(2) Cigarette smoking at parties
	(3) New law cracking down on un-permitted raves
	One really cool review of the Expressions party was posted by 
XXX, who wrote...<forwarded post follows>
	
	I'll bet lots of us would like to know what's going on elsewhere, 
and would read such reports with interest... I know I would.

Much Love,

Hello Folks !

 Well , I didn't go to anything this weekend , much less Chrysalis - 
because I was setting up and using some software I acquired before and during
MacWorld. One of the packages set me up with the Earthlink ISP for Web
Browsing! So now I'm using Netscape Navigator for $20/month to check out
web sites and download sound and MPEG software and other stuff , also checking
out great sites like http://www.mkzdk.org ( fantastic art! ).

 Would anyone like to recommend other web sites to me? Don't bother to 
post your reply on SFRaves if it isn't rave-related - just email me. Of course,
if it's a great web site , maybe you would want to turn others on to it!

 I've already checked out Laura & Brian's wedding pictures at hypereal.com/~laura,
and the SFRaver biographies at www.he.net/~swoosh/sfrbios , and the slow video
of the fish tank at www1.netscape.com/fishcam/fish_refresh.html , and the
Godzilla pages www.ama.caltech.edu/users/mrm/godzilla.html , and the house
web pages at I-don't-remember-right-now ... 

 Maybe I shouldn't be staggering around the Web so much !

 Oh Yes - for my wife , any recommendations for any sites that have animation
  or slow video like the fish tank one mentioned above , would be appreciated!

 Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com

PS - I'm still going to keep my NETCOM account for email, FTP , telnet , etc.

         one hell of a beautiful evening:)
   I haven't been posting any reviews lately but I definately
have to take time out this time. When I first arrived at the party I 
couldn't seem to figure out what to do with myself. Having been to the 
same site for Begin Again's NYE party, I found it much less crowded and 
greatly supplied with couches and rugs:). A big round of applause to
John Carel,Minor Minor, Freaky Chakra and Solar- who kept me at the party 
for an extra 15 minutes with a track from Aphex Twins:). I felt that this 
party brought me back in contact with my 'family' again. I got to meet a 
few new Sf ravers like Shawna and Matt and see old faces like Greg & Cindy 
(cute), Kevin and Jonas:). When Mr. Tony Rotundo stood up in the chill space
and yelled out " you better appreciate this";I got chills down my back:).
Having missed the first 2 parties, I can see now that Gateway Systems 
knows how to make anybody feel completely welcome with the care and 
dedication they bring to the scene!!!! 
                                Sending hugs galoreeeee-
                                Reagan
  P.S.- just for i.d. I was the one who was running around
with the bowl full of fruit in the morning:). It was a good idea, but I 
forgot to bring a garbage bag with me-- oopppssss:)

	that reminds me - about sobriety that is.

	i noticed a complete absence of any alcohol whatsoever
	at this party.  i thought this was a wonderful thing.
	not that i ran around looking for it or anything... but
	you usually see it at most underground all-ages parties.
	i thought the crowd was wonderful and friendly (people
	sure liked my kilt :) and very responsible.

	there were to many candles burning for my tastes, though.
	some firecodes exist for a reason.

	wonderful party, david and friends!!

hello Mr. James E, Esquire !!!

I can not agree with you about your list. I think I probably just threw this thread around because I was noticing how some of the people I know turn differently as soon as they become DJ's

maybe it is an ego thing, I don't know... I can only tell you that I met many DJs around here, the last one was Mrs. Wood, who was here for a while, and she was a very nice person. She stayed in my friend DJ DUB's house, and her wife, who is only into Soap Operas and lambada though she was really nice, althugh she had all those funny clothes and this crate of records... she never thought women DJ's actually existed, so she was very impressed.

Anyway, i also remember meeting laurent garnier, who is a nice guy, and Josh Wink, who i didn't really speak with, but his records were lost on his way to Brazil and I guess he wasn't too happy. It is word-of-mouth here that he will be not warmly welcomed around Rio if he comes back. I also met some other people, those mostly from the house music scene. Some of them, like little louie vega, are not friendly at all, if you are not from MTV or from some magazine, or are extremely nice, such as Tony Humphries and Frankie Knuckles.

At teh end, i guess some ppl are nice, some are not..such as in every group or business. ;) DIRCEU :)

Guarana is an aphrodisiac... and also an excellent energy supply, for those who aren't into taking E and stuff to be able to dance all night.

One can not promise you wonderful results by using Guarana, but, it's healthy and has no side effects. there is a sexual "smart drink" that they do here using Guarana, if ppl is interested, i can provide you guys with the recipe, and where to find the stuff in the DC - Baltimore area.


And here in Rio... well, I have been spinning in a weekly called "Qua-Qua" and still trying to promote a monthly. its name would be "Mind melt", alhough i am terribly lacking of good ideas at the moment... Things got really difficult here as now, and only now, almost 10 years later, E has become "the fashion drug"... Everywhere there is E, Blue Sunshine, Crystal. It is now turning to a point where DJing became really annoying... 50% of the crowd is looking for or in under effect of E or K, so sometimes it just turns to be very very boring to try to create something nice, while most people would rather dance in a pigsty, with plenty of E on sale.


the young middle-class E dealers here are called "E-boys". Sorry about that, Lonnie, they got a hold of your nickname... 


My new mixtape is almost ready. i only did not do it because I am stuck with things to do, from practising for the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu National Championships to filing applications fo Stanford, from trying to set up my new computer to going to Ipanema Beach. Now you can go to a place called "posto 9" and smoke marijuana there without much harassment from the cops. People on the beach now bring whstles and blow'em everytime the cops are around... so you have plenty of time to hide your cigarettes and whatever you want to. That's fun, everytime i hear tons of whistles !!!

I am done for now...sorry to bug you guys, but I have an opposition to a patent application and I should file it at the PTO tomorrow.. ;)

Since nobody has said anything about Eon, I thought I'd give
my view of it.  I was feeling more like hearing these big name
DJs than trusting what I know would've been a good party.  Some times
it pays off, like with Plastik last weekend, other times it doesn't
like this weekend.  It was in a warehouse in Oakland.  Actually a good 
space with that underground rave feeling.  Two small bathrooms and
a cold draft, which weren't good.  It could've been made warmer if people
were dancing but... The light show was good... the laser was good.
The sound was decent enough for the space.  Seems like it had potential.
But, I guess there are just many people out there who haven't learned to
let go.  I guess I was there once, as were most of us.  Where you
just aren't happy with where you are, and you feel like you're looking
for something, so you keep wandering around looking and looking for
that thing you don't have.  All the while, if you just stopped long
enough to realize what's going on and who you are, you would see that
you already have it.  So everyone at this party just kept moving around
looking for the fun, when if they just stopped and started dancing, they
might start creating their own fun.  But... no.  The forces of chaos
were just too unfocused here tonight, and nobody was dancing.
And then you build up a little bit of energy and someone bumps into
you and steals it all away, leaving you dry to start all over again.

After a few hours, I decided this was just too much work to hear some
new music.  and besides, the unfocused nature of the evening also
made itself known in the music... It would start getting good, but
then the DJ would lose it and start over.  so be it... and I left.
I think I needed a good nights sleep anyway.  

Maybe it got better towards the morning.  Maybe I needed a bad party
to make the next one all the better.  There's a lesson in everything.
Outside of that, however, I had a phenomenal weekend.  Maybe it was because
the rest of my weekend was so great, this party just couldn't hold it's own
in comparison.

anyway,
take care.

-john.

        Talk about a vibe killer for the people who do get searched. I sure
wouldn't want to be the one who had to explain why they were being searched
and not other people. What would I tell them? "Gee I'm sorry but I've just
made a snap judgment based solely on how you look and it seems you're not
wearing a rave approved, shit eating grin and that bandana is associated
with gang members and people of color you know" If you feel like you're not
trusted when everybody is being searched, think how you'd feel if you were
the only one getting searched.

        There's also more to look for than just weapons. There's markers,
spray paint, glass containers and nitrous tanks. Even the nicest raver can
break a glass bottle and thus risk cutting someone's foot. I've worked
parties where we didn't search people, and the space ended up so covered
with tags that we could never get permission to use the space again. I've
also worked F&F where we didn't search anybody and had no problems. It's a
tough call, but for a party the size of the Gathering I would definitely
search everyone.

Well, personally, I had a great time at EON. The warehouse 
was kind of small, but a lot of people showed up and I felt a 
good vibe. :)

Dimitry went off! He was just the bomb!! And I have to agree 
with John, the lights and visuals were excellent. Pierre 
didn't show and Frankie just slapped each record on and let 
it play, didn't use a second turntable. ????

Other than that, I had a great time and it kept my mind off 
other things. I hadn't been to a party since Planet Rock, so 
I was due for a party. :)

peace,
amyp

Chrysalis review
-----------------

About the only problem I had with Chrysalis was getting there.   As usual,
their choice for a map site was really fucked if you had to depend on public
transpo to get there,  and despite the great efforts I had in trying to talk
Clair into allowing me to go directly to the venue (2 blocks from where I get
off the bus),  instead of having to go all the way to the haight (IMPOSSIBLE
with the way the SF bus system works).   I DID manage to wangle a ride,
which costed me almost more than a 2 way cab fare to the haight,  but I
finally made it there.

When I arrived,  very few people were there,  but things were still getting
set up in the upstairs chill room (Where the juices were sold).   Upstairs was
playing Ambient,  and downstairs was the main room.

About 12:30 the place was almost packed to capacity,  and downstairs,
things were going off BIG TIME.   Joel (I think) was behind the turn tables at
that time,  playing some really good house.   After that,  Freaky Chakra went
on LIVE and blew me away with some amazing trancey housey stuff I
couldn't identify.  Everyone was getting off when they were playing.

Thankfully,  they had 3 fans downstairs keeping the air circulated,  but they
didn't provide much relief from the heat.   After 2am they allowed people to
leave and come back,  but I got so engrossed into the music,   especially
when John Carel went on and played an amazing trance set.   I danced his set
almost to the very end,  but towards the end,  things slowed down a bit,  and
I took the opportunity to find an empty floor space to stretch and chill for a
while.   After chilling,  Andre Lucero slowed things down a tad and played
some house,    all new stuff I didn't recognize.  First time I heard Andre,
and
he played a refreshing set.   Really well done.

Eventually,  Solar went on and as usual,  played a lot of newer stuff,  I did
recognize a few tracks he played at Sunset last summer,  but his sets were
even slightly slower and more layed back.   I was in my usual trancey mood,
enjoying the smooth bouncy tracks.    Sometime around 7:30,  they served
blueberry muffins,  croissants,  and OJ.   By then,  I was pretty hungry,  and
really appreciated the food.   Great job,  Gateway systems,  you all pulled
together a really top notch party,  that more than made up for the full moon
fiasco.

I can recommend a good safe MAP point in the SOMA location,  should
someone contact me,  that would make it much easier for us non-driving
folks to make it.   Just contact me.   It's a friends place near 2nd and
Townsend (Apartments) and it's SAFE.

hi...check out his url.  it's a real nice glossary that gives basic 
definitions to start with.  http://www.matisse.net/files/glossary.html.
also, my opinion on the connectivity discussion is that i subscribe to 
the list to read about and discuss rave culture so I would like to 
suggest that these other types of discussions go by personal email or 
another type of list unless it is somehow related to this list.

hello and yes this is yet another glowing review of this awesome party. 
first i want to thank gateway for going through all the trouble to 
organize such a great time for all. this party really blew my mind. so 
much positive attitudes and smiles. sorry i missed your set joel, but 
being with you and holly for a while later on *really* made my night. and 
the music by john and andre really totally sent me. really felt what great 
music with alot of energy, arranged/mixed/circulated skillfully by 
sensitive people can do. right on! thank you reagan for the oranges. man, 
they tasted so good, and the generosity in the gesture really added to an 
already incredibly envigorating atmosphere. lots of free water too. yeah!
i got there after 3am, and by this time it really did not seem too 
crowded... i have been to many parties there when it really was 
overcrowded, and this time in comparison, there were less people there. 
the lasers were awesome, and all the other details, like the large 
crystal hanging from the ceiling, and the rugs, and the candles, and the 
juice bar, and the spectrum analyser and oscilloscope etc., were all 
small details that when appreciated together, made the party a great 
place to be. i think all these small details show the commitment to 
ensuring people have a great time. right on again!
thank you again!

kevin

        There is a little rumour going around that one of Apple's big

	Could anyone refer me to a catalogue or dealer, online or 
otherwise, with mixing board stats and prices?  Actually, any info, 
opinions, advice, etc, you could offer would be highly appreciated. 
	I'm looking for a small, simple but durable mixing board with few 
features and inputs (4?).    

	Thanks for the help!  

	'twas great seeing so many folk at Chrysalis.  I was the guy with 
the Burger King crown, BTW.

Hey all!

I think my first post of my Chrysalis review really says it all for me, 
and you all who went probably know what I mean, but I still feel the 
need to actually speak of it!

Got there at about 12/12:30 or so, came by myself!  I had a much easier 
time this time around coming by myself than I did the first time I did 
it.  It wasn't so crowded when I first got there, but it certainly 
thicked up quite a bit in the ensuing hours!  The fans were very 
appreciated, and it was good having some open windows around in the 
upstairs area.  I had a great time!  The vibe was really fabulous I 
thought.  Going alone to a party like this is no problem for me, 
because I know for a fact I'll totally be surrounded by family once I 
get there!  And boy was I!  This party really made me feel really good 
to just be there, whether I was dancing or just hanging in the chill 
room, or whatever.  I really got the feeling that I was among total 
friends, from those I've met & hung with before to those I've never 
even seen before, like everything's okay, like if something went wrong 
you would be helped out & taken care of.  That was an important way for 
me to feel, I've never really felt like that at a rave before, as this 
was my first small one (my last rave was the Gathering, quite a size 
difference!)  To all those of you that went, thanks for being there, 
you were all very cool, and helped out muchly with the feeling of the 
whole thing!  It was great also because I got to meet a lot of new 
sfravers, more than I've met at previous parties: found Rocky Mullin, 
Matthew p.d.k. Lanier (deserves great mention!), Black Adder, Jonathan 
(the burger king crown guy!), Reagan Reid, Greg & Cindy, & Ozy 
(forrest)!  Also saw some familiar faces, Wayne, Amy & her friend 
Melanie (very cool!), Tim (knucklehead), & Tom Leichardt.  Also met 
Myster E. who was floating about the place, & laid eyes on Crunchman, 
although I never ended up meeting him.  I love meeting all you people, 
It's real nice to finally connect a face & person to the typed words 
that show up on my computer! Even got to introduce a couple of sfravers 
to each other, which is cool!  It's funny to see the look on people's 
faces when they've been talking for a while, and then they realize 
they're both sfravers.  
Anyway, it was all cool!  Dug the chill room with the rugs, couches, 
juice, fruit & smoothies.  Water was abundant, dug the collective 
feeling of everybody in the place, and I hope another one of these 
comes around soon!  Looking forward to FnF, of course, hope to see all 
you there!


Love,
Shawna

Hello All,

I've just been observing as of late and I haven't been to a party since 
the Gathering.  I'm the girl who lives in Fresno.

I'm planning on coming to SF on the 20th for a party.  Is there a good 
one?  I looked on the calendar but nothing was listed for that date 
(except the weeklies).  What's up?

I would love to go anywhere Doc Martin is playing so can someone please 
keep me posted.  My home number is (209) 447-9536 for anyone who wants to 
call with info/plans.  Thanks:)

Marty

p.s.  Hi Shawna!

Hello Gang,
It is Pam from Santa Rosa.  I want to know if  there is anyone North of SF
that is into car pooling to parties in the city.  When going to raves in the
city, I usually go by myself, since it is rare to find anyone of the House
music breed in this town.  But for fun and safety reasons I think it would be
alot better car pooling, plus then you can take turns driving. It is hard
sometimes staying awake when you have got to make a 47 mile ride back home
with no one to keep you awake!!!  Rolling down the window and having your
favorite tape on really loud, sometimes doesn't work to well.  Drop me some
mail, if your any where north or know someone up north.  Thank you.

Pam

Hello!

	I'm also searching for roommates.  We have two bedrooms opening 
up at our house in the oakland hills.  It is super chill, and far enough 
away from the neighbors to be as loud as we want.  We've got lots of good 
energy and want to share it with some 
honest/likeminded/positive/spiritual ravers.  

	Please contact me at lmnt@c2.org if you're interested.

	::hugs::

	e colmar

Many props go out to the promoters and supporters of this party.  They put
alot of hard work into it and it showed.  This was definately one of the
best Sacto raves I've been to.  The space was incredible...a virgin
wareshouse with high ceilings and plenty of space...but not to big either.
There were three very clean bathrooms that all worked...all night.  They
stayed clean too....and we all know that's a definate +.  Lots of nice
visual art on the walls with minimal but sufficient lighting.  The sound was
top notch.  Four huge cabinets blasting somthing like 16000 watts (I'm
quoting Andrew the sound god here).  Clean..crisp sound that was not so loud
that you couldn't get away from it.  One of the last dj's spun jungle and it
was a bit loud if you were up front, but I stayed back and all was good.
There was a small pool of styrofoam packing stuff to play in that was quite
fun.  The temperature stayed cool all night....never got too hot.

And let me tell you about the ambient space.  (which many of you know this
is the make it or break it selling point for me) By far...the best ambient
space I've ever been in/played in.  Let's start with the floor shall
we....Carpet..with carpet pad.  They just happened to be driving by a house
that was being recarpeted and scored all the old stuff and the padding.
Super big space that was completely carpeted.  Lots of tapestries, pictures,
art and general stuff hanging from the walls and the 25 foot ceilings.  With
a nice sound barrier that they built to minimize the sound bleeding from the
main room. It worked quite well.  And there were christmas trees....lots of
them.  They lined one whole wall and wrapped around in kind of a square
spirial into the center of the room.  It was kind of a private chill spot
within the chil spot.  They also brought in a five foot fat log to sit on to
complete the wood'sy feel.
We had the decks and all the live equipment sitting on crates about a foot
off the floor so as to be on the same level with all the sitting/laying
people.  Really nice chill vibe all night.  Props to Fil for his
ambient/triphop/acidjazzy set.  It felt really good.  The only problem I had
was that one of my keyboards started going crazy and playing notes that I
was not telling it to play.  Sorry to any of your ears that may have been
infected.  Ten minutes later after not being able to figure out what was
going wrong and stressing heavily I just turned it off then back on and
everything worked fine.  Wish I would have thought of that before.  It was
all good in the end.  Thanks to my friend Eric for playing with me on three
hours notice.

The only thing that was lacking was a strong vibe.  I think alot of Sac
people could use some lessons in vibe creating from many of you on this
list.  The vibe was there, and I experienced it with a few people who were
helping to create it.  It just seemed that many of the people there just
wouldn't let go....which is what I did....and several times lost my mind....
I had total fun dancing...and it's been a while since that has happened.  

Well I think I've ranted enough.  Until next time Synthetic.  Thanks for
listening.

Rick

Gosh, not to dis Sac or anything - but the reason you mentioned above is 
the exact reason why I make the hour and a half drive to SF *all the time*!
I know many sac people that wont go to local parties because SF is just 
better. I still go to local parties every once in a while....I plan to go 
to Groove Trip to support one of my best friends who is spinning (dj Q).
It is really sad.  I personally know many of the promoters and most all 
of them have hearts of gold with the best of intentions. But generally 
the people that go to these events don't put as much into it - they don't 
"loose themselves" as you say. John Darrow made the point about EON that 
people kept searching for the vibe and it never came, when  all you have 
to do is start it yourself.  That is how I *always* feel at a Sacramento 
event.  The vibe is always just out of reach.  I have fun, sure - I have 
many friends here.  But I have never had one experience here that comes 
close to the fantastic orgasmic times I've had in SF.  One exception 
would be Elevation that was held in the mountains last fall.  I did have 
a great time there and the vibe was right on.  If only it happened more 
often. <sigh>

love,
Amy

	I am looking for a trustworthy raver who knows accounting, that 
would be willing to manage the books for a rave industry based company, 
with interests in: promotion, equipment rental, graphics, act booking, 
and other scene needs.  We have been active for two and a half years now, 
and we've decided that it is time to become legitimate.  We are extremely 
laid back, but hard working in that we love what we do.
	We are still in the preperation stages, and expect the project to 
be underway in two to three months.

We have to make it ourselfs...by supporting parties in this area.  Many
people need to feel it to really know it exists.  I think a f&f or crysalis
would do great at the location of this event.  I think people may even make
the treck from sf to attend a good party in a fresh location...and give some
lessons in vibe.  Don't get me wrong...Sac's not all bad.  If you search,
you can find the vibe....and I have at several Sac parties.  It usually just
doesn't hit you in the face like some sf party experiences.

Amy, amyp here. I definitely agree with you. I don't know 
why, but here in Sac we just don't have the vibe. I love to 
support Jason(Groove Trip Prod.) and my other friends who put 
together parties, but like you said, that's why I go to the 
city. The crowds and all together vibe is soooo awesome. Not 
to say that the Sac family is not wonderful. They are indeed!

If you notice, not many people will drive from S.F.to go to a 
Sac party. Why? We don't have it here. That's too bad. 
Mikey(In Touch Prod.) has been having his parties in the bay, 
and more people attend.

Anyway, I really don't know what to do about this, we just 
need to get together and find out what "rave vibes" are all 
about. :) We all have it in us. I love all the Sac kids.

peace guys,
amyp

You must be talking about information. A friend of mine was going up to sac
for the holidays and asked me what he could check out (clubs/record stores)
while he was there. I had to regretfully/surprisingly tell him that there
was no information available on the SFR calendar. He ended up being bored
for a week.

don't mention this to anyone! or else!) and many of my future plans of
marriage with this girl are suddenly in jeopardy.  as you can figure, i'm
sitting here watching my world crash and the only thing i can focus on is my
computer (fancy that).  i need to ask for a dose of energy from anyone
willing to give it, and will return it as soon as i am able.

thank you all-

peace, love, and other relationship crap-

Aw right, after a number of posts I received, including being slightly 
chastised 
for posting this, I have to make a statement.  The following post was a 
JOKE.  Get it, I was JOKING.  I was not soliciting nor requesting.  I was 
simply acknowledging the PUN.  But, I will never do that again.  Man, I 
thought it was a pretty obvious pun at that, but I was dead wrong.  
Having to explain a pun really sucks too!!! :)  Then it is no longer 
punny!! :) 

Now I am punned out and slightly confused no one appreciated my humor 
except the author himself!!

Adios Amigos,
kc

Got some comments and some questions:

Spundae: YES!  The beat in the Keith Herring (sp?) room was ON!  Bone 
shaking BASS and phat mixes.  Heard some Planet Rock (the song) getting 
mixed in, haven't heard that in quite a while.  Lots of rooms, lots of 
people but not too crowded, lots of great vibe.  Met a few people (wassup 
Tom, Sharon, Virginia!) and danced my butt off.  Nothing quite like driving 
home just as the 6am morning commute is starting up...hehe...  Wiped out the 
next day, but by 9pm I was ready to do it again!  That's the kind of venue 
that could make me want to do the do every night.

Now for the questions:  Who was on the turntables in the Keith Herring room at
1:30, 3:00, and 3:30?  I was too busy working the stage to check it out, but 
the people in the room were going nuts to some really phat beat.  I GOTTA KNOW!

I'm totally into this idea.  I don't know if I can do it on a
monthly/regular basis, but I would definately like to participate with a

HHHHHIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSZZZZZZAAAAAAPPPPP!!!!!!

Consider yourself energized...

Ok, how about this, a little humor.  I'd love to say I created this, but I 
didn't.  On the other hand, I've been thinking of using excerpts in my 
resume from now on:

---------
3A.  ESSAY IN ORDER FOR THE ADMISSIONS STAFF OF OUR COLLEGE
TO GET TO KNOW YOU, THE APPLICANT, BETTER, WE ASK THAT YOU
ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION:	ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT
EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD, OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU HAVE
REALIZED, THAT HAVE HELPED TO DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON?

I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing
ice.  I have been known to remodel train stations on my
lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat
retention.  I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I
write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently.
Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.

I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I
can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed,
and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes.  I am
an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in
Peru.  Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once
single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin
from a horde of ferocious army ants.  I play bluegrass
cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of
numerous documentaries.  When I'm bored, I build large
suspension bridges in my yard.

I enjoy urban hang gliding.  On Wednesdays, after school, I
repair electrical appliances free of charge.  I am an
abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie.
Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy
evening wear.  I don't perspire.  I am a private citizen,
yet I receive fan mail.  I have been caller number nine and
have won the weekend passes.  Last summer I toured New
Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration.  I
bat .400.  My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame
in international botany circles.  Children trust me.

I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with
deadly accuracy.  I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and
David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish
an entire dining room that evening.  I know the exact
location of every food item in the supermarket.  I have
performed several covert operations for the CIA.  I sleep
once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair.  While on
vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group
of terrorists who had seized a small bakery.  The laws of
physics do not apply to me.

I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all
paid.  On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in
full-contact origami.  Years ago I discovered the meaning of
life but forgot to write it down.  I have made extraordinary
four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven.  I
breed prizewinning clams.  I have won bullfights in San
Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling
bees at the Kremlin.  I have played Hamlet, I have performed
open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.

But I have not been to college.

Rick, I am so glad that you uphold the idea of making and sharing *vibe* rather 
than going out looking for it.  Sometimes, we all want to be nurtured and look 
for a good vibe party or group to hang with but ultimately, we all know we can 
tap into this energy on our own...we've just forgotten how to on a natural 
basis.  Music, dance, and raving plays an important role by overloading our 
physical senses allowing us to override our egos (or sense of self) and to 
reattune our spiritual self to the connective energy we all share.

I believe that as a group, if we are to progress in our beliefs of higher 
consciousness, after gaining awareness comes sharing and education of what we've
discovered.  Perhaps a group of sfravers might want to consider "juicing a jam" 
with me. I've done this with another dance group where we all attend a 
particular party once a month and converge with smiles, hugs, and tons of luvin'
energy.  This might also be a way for alot of us who haven't met to connect too!
 After doing this a few times, the community can grow in numbers and 
interactions outside of raves as people look forward to attending an event 
that's being juiced based on positive energy.

So if any of you want to join me in this endeavor, let me know and we can blast 
our luv phasers sometime in early February.

Oooo, just writing writing this makes me tingle knowing what positive energy we 
can share.  Hope you feel it too!

Hugs and warm smiles,
Diane

We have to make it ourselfs...by supporting parties in this area.  Many 
people need to feel it to really know it exists.  I think a f&f or crysalis 
would do great at the location of this event.  I think people may even make 
the treck from sf to attend a good party in a fresh location...and give some 
lessons in vibe.  Don't get me wrong...Sac's not all bad.  If you search, 
you can find the vibe....and I have at several Sac parties.  It usually just 
doesn't hit you in the face like some sf party experiences.

That was my first Spundae. It was pretty crowded for a weekly club, and
especially a Sunday! The vibe was surprisingly good, too. I also saw a lot
of familiar faces.

I saw Carlos ripping it up in the basement around the same time Dimirti was
spinning upstairs.

The tiny Teknotika room was always packed and had a nice piece of art on
the wall that was in the juice bar room at Chrysalis the night before.

In the main room, the Keith Haring room, featuring their new "6-way digital
sound system" :-) was:

from 11:30pm - 1:00am EFX
from  1:00am - 2:30am Dimitry (Dee-Lite) (he played the Planet Rock song)

I got really tired, being out at Chrysalis all night the night before, so I
left around 2:00am. I don't know who came on after that for sure, but I got
the impression that either the 2:30-4:00 or 4:00-5:30 slot was going to be
Doc Martin. When I left at 2:00am I still hadn't seen Doc anywhere in the
building, so he may have played the closing set.

B.S.  That's how it feels, sure, but you know that everything is fine.  
Look,  I love a lot of people.  I can say that without inhibition.  But I 
wouldn't marry them, y'know?  I love my friend Sean like a brother, but I 
wouldn't even have him as a roommate -- no offense Sean, if you happen 
across this...  

You could probably continue to love her, and she could always be a special 
friend, but move on.  There are so many really wonderful people around.  
Don't sweat it.

Know what I do?  I start taking my lady friends to lunch.  A different one 
every day.  Nothing expensive or anything, just someplace decent.  The 
female company is really nice, you can strengthen the friendship with the 
gesture, and they're always super supportive.  I can complain about the 
relationship, or I can just soak up a little pleasant conversation.  Makes 
me feel a lot better, and often they'll try to set me up with someone.  
Women are much better at match-making than men, IMHO.

Peas,

S

To fellow musicians and DJs with live sound asperations (sp). (I'm not
sure this info is wholy relevant to the list, but I'm sure there's a
few of you out there who, like me, live on this stuff.) :

I was very interested in seeing what gear Freaky Chakra used to do his
live techno performance. I like this live sound dance gig format. I'm
interested in doing it myself someday. So, I made a special effort of
looking down on top of Mr. Freaky during his performance. I think it
is especailly interesting to compare this guys gear usage to that of
Banco de Gaia. I wish that oportunity to see Eat Static didn't fall
through.

The stuff:

* Ensoniq SD-1 ( not SQ-1 ) synthisizer. This was his only
sequencer. I'm not familiar with Ensoniq on board sequencers, but I
wouldn't be suprised if they have special features to facilitate live
performance. He was all over this keyboard (the buttons, not the
keys)most of the performance.
* Roland TR-909
* Sequential Pro-One. I don't think he used this much. 
* Novation Bass-station Rack. Always going. 
* Ensoniq DP/4. I want one! This was the only effects box I saw, but
who needs any more.
* Emax II sampler. I believe he only used this for some vocal
samples. That's the only time I saw him go for the volume slider on
it.
* Ensoniq mirage sampler rack. Old gear. I doubt he used this much as
well.
* Roland JV-## rack. I think I remember seeing a single rack space
synth of this type in there.
* Mackie 1604 mixer. He had levels set from the beginning and didn't
touch them much from what I could tell. I think he always brought up
the levels on the individual instruments instead. Like I said before,
he was controlling everything from the SD-1 sequencer.
* Compressor/Limiters. Lots of this all the time. Probably on the
whole mix because there were only two channels, although he could have
been using them for bass and kick ( a guess).

Notes and Observations:

I only saw one time he actually played a part on the keyboard. It was
a rather weak melody. His fingers where shaking so much. 

Comparing to Banco de Gaia at the Trocadero, Mr. Banco was all
computer based sequencing, two synced Amiga/Atari(?) always running,
and ran stuff through a huge board. He was always on the board instead
of on the sequencers. He'd just start a new sequence every few pieces
and mix from the running sounds. He never touched a sound source.

Banco had a more complex sound, but also about 5 times the gear in
numbers, and 30 times in cost. I think Freaky had some dead spots
where things were not working correctly. Banco didn't. Of course the
style of music is a bit different.

Frankly, I liked Freaky's approach better. Let's not get overwhelmed
in overly produced, like the CD sound. Let's get those people
dancing. I'd rather see 5 Freaky Chakra's than one Banco de Gaia, and
considering the investment involved, that's what will happen. On a CD,
I like Banco de Gaia's sound better, and the music, but live, Banco
came off a bit stale. Freaky was a better live act, and I think that's
largely due to his use of gear, and maybe the vibe.

I barely remember seeing Orbital ( with UltraMarine and MeatBeatM)
years ago. Their setup and approach to the gear was sort of inbetween
Banco and Freaky. Although, I think they had much more
hands-on-the-instruments than either. They also had more actual
keyboards than either of these two, and everything was on big Ultimate
keyboard stands instead of in racks.

Anyway, I hope this was informative for someone.

I just wanted to let everyone know that MaD, as usual, was a fun, laid-back,
techno-heavy groovefest at the Bahia. Jon and Joe both turned in tight sets,
and Dave Cooper totally went insane (although I think people differed as to
whether this was a good or bad thing). He is a _super_ nice guy, too, being
very easy to talk to, totally down-to-earth and friendly. He can come back
here any time he wants, 'cuz I say so. :)

One of my favorite things about MaD is its social and friendly atmosphere.
Even though the space was (comfortably) crowded last night, everybody was
still chatty, open and relaxed. There was no spurious attitude to be
found. Monday nights have become a social touchstone for me, and I enjoy the
opportunity to sit around and talk to other raverfolk in a non-threatening
atmosphere.

I was especially excited to find out that Carl Craig is going to be playing
at MaD February 5th. I almost hesitate to mention it because it's going to
turn the place into a total zoo (or at least it will if there's any justice
in the world). In any case, y'all should definitely plan to check that out
-- Mr. Craig is a techno hero, having put out many classics over the past
few years: Paperclip People's "Throw", 69's "Jam The Box" and "Rushed",
BFC's "Chicken Soup", and many, many others. He's as precise as a surgeon
and has enough soul to rival James Brown. Check it out.

Once I was used as an imported audience/fan. I was asked, along with
some friends to jump on a bus that was going down to LA to a show for
a band that was playing at a club in front of a bunch of record
industry big stiffs. There was a complementary party in the hills
afterwards. A weird scene, but if definitly did help the vibe and the
band.

My point is that the idea of "blitzing" a party to help out the vibe
is a good idea, even though this example is a bit different. Would be
fun too.

I have one complaint about the searching at the Gathering.  If you were 
female, and you had one of the male guards search you, they didn't check 
for anything.  I had a whole backpack of stuff for the evening, although 
nothing I think would have been confiscated, and the male guard didn't 
even look at it.  However, my male friend following me in, got searched 
like crazy and got a couple things confiscated.  I don't think this is 
very fair, and once again judgments are being made as to how a person looks.

Hey All:

Really depressing news this weekend that I'm going blind. I'm having 
surgery under general anaesthetic Monday January 22nd.

I'll be away from the list and my email 1/22 thru 1/29.

I haven't met many of you in person simply because I haven't been out 
with all of my recent problems. Please send good vibes my way to help 
thru the surgery and recovery. I know that when this group pulls 
together magical things DO happen... I hope ya'll will extend that 
magic to help me out. I appreciate it a lot!

Thanks in advance to all the kind souls on this list!

Stay +++++,
Alissa

You're right, Mark. It does sound phony, and it felt phony doing it,
and it's a bad idea, and I wouldn't do it again anyway, now that you
mention it. So, strike it from the books, and nevermind :#

Um, I don't think that is what Rick meant (Rick correct me if I am 
wrong).  I think getting a bunch of people together to go out is a great 
idea.  It is easier for me to enjoy myself and dance and lose it when I 
have a bunch of friends around me doing the same thing.  

When I lived in SoCal, there was (they are still there) this group of 
people that were always in the middle of the dancefloor just carefree 
boogeying and having a good time, smiling and laughing.  When they walked 
into a party or a club it always seemed as though the vibe of the whole 
room was elevated a notch.  I looked forward to seeing them.  (I actually 
saw a couple of them upstairs at Begin Again and it made my night.  You 
might have noticed a really tall redhead girl shaking her booty, if you 
were there.)  They were also the core group who put on the moontribe 
parties, which were the most amazing parties I have yet experienced, and 
I think that has to do with the great spirit of those people.  

So, Rick I'm with you.  I would love to be a part of something like 
that.  

Cheers****
Cami

        well not only did only(3?)people talk about Eon but no one
mentioned Doc Martain's set!!He was of course brilliant!(even got to meet
the Son of a Gun!).Dimitry(Super DJ)'s set was awsome!was too spun to
listen to Frankie's set..KArizma did good too and Pierre WAS there but I
heard about something like Doc spun his records and something abvout a new
style  like that I do not remember.
        The rumors are true Lady Kier WAS there (cause I was standin right
next to her durin dimitry's set)The space smelled like shit when I first
arrived, but the smell went away as more people arrived I learned NOT to
mix GHB w/anything (and that it SUCKS!)the space was very undergroundy like
someone said it had alot o potentiel? but nobody was dancin really...it
wasn't a bad party(with  the line-up I feel it was impossible for that to
happen..but the vibe wasn't all that.People were friendly if you did talked
to them but otherwise they just clammed up. and Jeno don't you dare spin a
set without playin' Sweet Dreams(I don't think it's cheesy DAMNIT!!!)
well that's my 2 cents,I think I'll take a break until Area 51 gotta charge
up all the batteries for that one..till then..

I think that's a GREAT idea - to be more consciously committed to creating a
vibe at a party --

At the last Wicked, I met Keith, the tall British guy with blonde hair and fuzzy
red hat and overalls -- and he made such an impression on me -- he took it as
his mission that night to talk to everyone, introducing them, sharing his open
heart and sweet nature -- it was incredible to watch -- like a missionary of
spirit

As a result, I met several people I hope to see again, and had an awesome time,
because he connected me to his spirit - and I usually tend to be more of a loner
at parties --

Then I was so happy to see him at Chrysalis doing the same thing, and I've
decided that I want to more consciously take that same kind of role -- as if I
were hosting the party, opening up to help others have a good time makes you
have a good time too -- and having a good time is always my ultimate goal!

Nope, I don't think it would be phony - cause once we start our smiling happy

        Word to that! I saw him play live last Sept in Boston and he was
really interesting. I didn't go for a lot of his slower, ambient soul type
stuff (he played in the middle of the night) but when he played "Rushed"
ppl went nuts! The panning between the speakers was sequenced so amazingly!
Ahhh! GO! GO!

        Well one of the cool things about networks like the net or your
brain, is it's ability to synthesize seemingly dissimilar things: so that's
what i'm going to try:
        First, Starchild's idea of a phone network, and the subsequent
ideas of brunches, or vibe tribes is basically a phenomena that is sort of
pulling us all together in an odd sort of way. Even i'm feeling it here in
montreal, and it's making my chances for getting outta here go amazingly
smooth (or at least giving me the energy to see positively through
problems) :) But yep, it's a phenomena that's for sure, three separate
threads all pointing to one thing (or at least from my semi-myopic eyes ;)
        And then shawna posted something like this...

        This is something i've noticed is really special about the rave
scene: comfort among 'strangers' which leads me to some things i thought
about 'networks' or 'complex systems':
================
Yep, i have been thinking much about how to survive and networks
are probably hte biggest source of strength that we have. Whether it be for
me and the net and doing graphics and HTML or simply the network of friends
and family or even just casual acquaintances that offer help, networks are
the way to go. And another thing that is drawing me to SF is the presence
of a network of ppl who have a certain level of consciousness about this
fact. When a network (like SFraves, or the rave scene, or SF in general) is
self-aware of its strength in diversity and *helping each other out*  it
becomes even MORE powerful and elevates itself to even HIGHER levels of
complexity and beauty :) This is why i think it'll be easier for me to make
a go of it in SF rather than say, New york city, because there are
individuals in the community that are aware of the fact that their strength
comes from their contacts and other people, NOT from a dog-eat dog, you or
me mentality.
=================
        Sorry about the semi-irrelevant personal stuff, but you get the hint :)
        I think that the stronger and more linked up a network is, the
faster it can achieve some sense of self-awareness, and complexity. And i
think that in a lot of ways SF is way ahead of other 'scenes' because the
people in the network are more open and communicative, allowing information
to flow faster, and also acting (in my limited experience) as a sort of
support net for the constituent parts.
        I wrote this first mostly just thinking about my place in the world
and how i'd like to be plopped into the middle of the SF network, but i
think that this may apply to everyone on the list for themselves. I'll give
anyone my phone number as soon as it's not long distance ;)
        Could you imagine if the 'rave scene' became self-aware of itself
as a network? and the power it (and i guess we :) ) could have? WOW! :)
        Or maybe i'm just an idealistic utopian type! who knows!
                much peace,
                        brad

Hello,
I lost your mail.  I don't know what happened to it.  The next parties I will
want to go to are probably Alien's or Raindance or both.   This weekend there
doesn't look like much is happening so far.  I have plans the night of
Overdose.  Anyways, email me back.

Isn't it weird, too, how many of us living outside of San Francisco visit 
SF and afterward, feel a real yearning to be a part of that living 
organism. SF has nearly become the "end all be all" of everything!  The 
people who already live there may not see it as clearly as us outsiders 
because they are immersed in it all the time.  Believe me, that energy is 
*there*!

love,
Amy

Hi all ... after lurking on this list for months and months, I know it's 
about time for me to post something.
My name's Dan, I'm 26, and I moved to SF from Boston about 6 months ago. 
Luckily, I hooked up with this list pretty quickly and got to go to some of 
F-8's amazing outdoor summer parties ... I've been hooked on Trance ever 
since. Some friends and I went to Chrysalis last weekend, and had a great 
time ... I met Leslie (with the cool hat!), and a bunch of other people 
who's names I've already forgotten ... (I'm terrible w/ names until the 
3rd or 4th time ... sorry). I was wearing a shirt with a monkey on it, 
and a black bandana on my head ... maybe you saw me.

re: Joe's "Appreciate this!" ... I've lived all over the country, and 
have never seen anything that compares with the SF rave scene. We have 
the ideal climate for it here, and I'll never let myself take what we 
have here for granted.

peace,
Dan

BTW: Is anyone aware of anything happening on Saturday other than that $2 
house party? I have some friends coming in from out-of-town, and would 
like to hit the best party possible.

Do any of you old schoolers out there know the political history behind the
moratorium on Cabaret Licenses south of Market? I'm pretty sure that the
biggest issue was that the police said they didn't have enough manpower to
handle all the people that were coming down to the clubs. But were there
other reasons for it? Who issued them, the planning commision?

Has anybody heard if our buddy Fred Lau (sp?) has announced any changes in
precinct captains?

Thanks. Keep Smiling,
Colin

Many of us came from other parts of the country "to be here when it happens".
I now actually live well within the confines of The City (and it is a great
feeling !) For me I knew I had to move after the election of 1994 when 
prop 187
and a whole bunch of racist laws were put on the ballot here in california,
the ONLY county where they consistantly got less than 10% of the vote was
San Francisco, there is strength in numbers...

Believe me I love the Bay Area and rarely leave but you are correct in 
assuming that people who live here don't realize how good they really have
it until they move away.

Hey all!

I'm going to try an experiment.  A while ago, there was some discussion 
about an IRC sfraves channel, and as far as I can see, nothing really 
came of it.  However, I am still interested in chatting with you all, 
so I figure I'll try this out.  Tomorrow, Thursday Jan. 18th, I am 
going to start up #sfraves at 8 pm, and see who shows!  Anybody 
interested in showing up & chatting live with other sfravers should 
stop by & check it out!  I have no idea if 1 person or 100 people will 
show, but that's why they call it an experiment!  Anybody who wants to, 
please stop by & say hi!

#sfraves
Thursday
January 18th
8 pm!


Love,
Shawna

p.s.  If somebody has already started an #sfraves-type of channel that 
now exists, & I just don't know about it, let me know!

Right on Amy.  I love SF and as soon as I graduate from CSU Fresno...I'm 
there.  I hate driving back after a great party.  Not to mention all the 
great parties I am missing like MAD and Chrysalis.  Dang....it's killing 
me.  

I will be there this weekend.  Doesn't seem like anything is going on 
though!  What's that about?  A weekend off from parties??  No way!


I'll meet you someday,

	Well, when you put it that way, I wouldn't want to be the one to have 
to explain to some people why only they were being searched either.  Really 
I wasn't advocating this as a preferred solution, only saying that when I 
am being searched, this is my instinctive reaction.  I would like to 
think that searching only those who looked like potential troublemakers 
would encourage people to dress and act more friendly in order to avoid 
being searched, but I realize that unfortunately it is more likely 
that the result would be what Michael describes above than that the 
searchees would take the hint and adopt a less intimidating attitude.

> 
	You're right Michael, it is a tough call.  But after careful 
thought, I would have to say the best policy is to search no one.  Some 
of you are thinking yeah, right, you're living on another planet.  But 
when you think about it, it's all an expectations game.  I haven't been 
to the opera recently, but I don't think they search the crowds at the 
opera house.  Are opera-goers inherently less violent than ravers?  Does 
all the talk about love and community in our scene really stack up to no 
more than a facade for a violence-prone group of people who must be 
searched when gathered en masse?  
	I don't believe this is true.  I think some simple tactics on the 
part of promoters can reduce the risk of violence on the part of 
partygoers to almost nothing without the need to search people.  
	First, promote your party carefully.  Select images for your 
fliers and a message for your voicemail that are unlikely to attract 
negative elements.  Ideally, the sole or predominate means of promotion 
should be on a personal level.  When you are personally invited, by phone 
or in person, to attend a party by one of the people putting it on, I 
think you are more likely to want to avoid creating trouble at the event, 
besides being more likely to attend in the first place.
	Also, I don't know about the rest of you, but I can't think of 
anyone I know, and this includes people of all different races, who I 
feel would be a security risk at a party.  This says to me that either 
people who do not know any ravers are showing up at raves, or some ravers 
are choosing their friends a bit indiscriminately.  Personally I cannot 
see associating with the kind of person who would bring a weapon to a 
rave with *any* possibility of using it aggressively.  If this is just 
me, please let me know.
	Second, treat people with love and respect.  If despite your best 
efforts, you end up with a crowd in line at your event that looks like 
they could pose a problem, greet everybody with a hug and a smile at the 
door, ask them to treat the space and their fellow party-goers with love 
and respect, and with this in mind whether there is anything they would 
like to leave at the door and pick up later.  Don't hire brutish security 
people who are only too ready to push people around or pick a fight.  The 
presence of police barricades, and paraphenalia like walkie-talkies 
and security jackets associated with large scale concerts and such create 
the perception that the promoters are expecting trouble, and 
paradoxically make it more likely that their expectations will be met.
	Finally, as far as bottles and that sort of thing, I think they 
are an acceptable risk.  If one breaks, clean it up.  You can't present a 
totally safe environment, nor should you try.  For one thing it would 
mean keeping all the lights on continually so that no one would 
accidentally trip and fall or injure someone else with an elbow or such.
Just my two dollars and twenty-two cents...   ;)

Much love,

Dear Family,

	Back in 1992 around the time I first started going to parties I 
remember meeting some ravers who were part of something called the San 
Jose Posse, a group that sounded like it might have had (has?) something 
like this in mind... Anybody hear of them or know if they're still around?
	This has been another of those little "How to make a better 
scene?" thoughts floating around at the back of my brain, and big hugzz 
to Diane & Rick for reviving it.
	I thought before about the idea of everyone wearing something 
distinctive, such as bright colored raingear... was never quite sure if 
such a move would bring people closer together or create new divisions.  
Any thoughts?

Good fucking question!  I hope someone who knows the ins and outs of the 
permit and licensing process will post a lengthy response to this.  It's 
the kind of information that could surely do us all a world of good if we 
spread it around and pool our knowledge.

As far as my personal knowledge, the word is spelled "cabaret", and the 
American Heritage Dictionary offers this:

 (kab1-rE2) n.
1. A restaurant or nightclub providing short programs of live entertainment.
2. The floor show presented by such a restaurant or nightclub.

Maybe someone would also be interested in contacting Da Mayor's office 
and finding out what his policy on granting permits/licenses will be?  
This might give us a good clue as to whether his administration will live 
up to the expectations of some of the more optimistic among us (myself 
regrettably not included in said company)...

Dear Bruce,

	Glad to see you on this list!  Didn't know you were a 
subscriber... 
	For those of you who haven't heard of Bruce, he is the author of 
a neat book called "Extasy: The MDMA Story."  I've seen him at a couple 
events, including the first Orb party at the Warfield, and enjoyed 
pointing him out to people as "the guy who wrote the book on E".  :)
	I haven't yet had a chance to read Hakim Bey's (correct spelling) 
book on Temporary Autonomous Zones, not even sure if that's the exact 
title, but I was fortunate enough to stumble across a spoken word tape of 
his entitled simply T.A.Z. at Streetlight Records on Market Street for 
$2.50, and it's got some wonderful philosophic stuff on it.  He's truly 
an original thinker, and a very cogent one, imho.
	This concept of a Permanent Autonomous Zone excites me very much...
Libertarian computer programmer Eric Klein of Las Vegas Nevada has 
something like this in mind I believe.  He has plans for the construction 
of a new country in the Carribean, in the form of a man-made floating 
city in international waters off the coast of Panama.  Eric has raised 
money and marketed t-shirts & other paraphenalia to pay for the 
construction of a scale model which last I heard was going to be going on 
display in Las Vegas.  The cost of building this new country called 
Oceania is huge, in the billions, and for this reason many have given his 
"Atlantis Project" little chance of success, but what he wants to do is 
truly inspirational.  In Oceania, you would be free to do whatever you 
wanted as long as you didn't harm anyone else, the only exception being 
the export of prohibited substances to countries banning such substances, 
to avoid bringing the wrath of the U.S. and others down upon the new 
nation.  Anyone would be free to move there and buy, rent, or build 
space, if I remember correctly.
	Eric can be contacted at the email address listed in the header 
of this message.

Yours In Liberty,
				<<< Starchild >>>

I'm sure he's a groovy guy too.  :)

If all goes well, Matt from Skylab (Astralwerks recording artists) will be 
doing a guest spot on my radio show tonight, probably from around 
10-11:30pm.  For those who've never heard him spin, he plays very 
eclectic and often psychotic trip-hop.  Hope you can listen!

**Aurora Borealis**
with guest dj Matt from Skylab
Thursday 1/18/95
10:00pm
KALX Berkeley 90.7fm

Also, Soundworks is now partially sponsoring the show, so there will be 
lots of new music for the station in coming weeks.

I was just wondering if anyone would be interested in doing something like
this. Have a Huge picnic at a park, perhaps Vasona in Los Gatos (great park)
or maybe at a beach. At a park we might have to bring a boom box with
everyone favorite mix tape or CD. At a beach we might get away with a sound
system. I have a BBQ that is as long as a bed of a pickup, which has plenty
of room for everyone food, ribs, chicken, steak, hamburger, hot dogs, veggie
stuff. If everyone brought something we could have a really good time. It a
good chance to meet everyone outside of a rave. That way we can sit and talk
or do what ever. If this sounds like a good Idea, I can check out what it
take and all the rules to reserve a picnic area at Vasona. They have BBQ pits
there too. If everyone wants to have it at a beach. With a little help from a
couple people we can take my big BBS onto the beach. I think this would be a
good oppurtunity(ms) to meet one another that we don't know and see familiar
faces as well. A great chance to get closer to one another and have a really
good time. So what does everyone think? Let me know.

I posted the original question. My understanding of Cabaret Licences is they
are issued to businesses such as nightclubs and allow them to operate more
freely than bars---they can admit minors (I believe) as well as remain open
after 2am. I believe you would not need one to do a one-time event in a 
wharehouse.

***Important*** We may have a few very small opportunities to enhance our
situation with the new Brown administration BUT we have to be careful and
intelligent. We need to inform ourselves of the history behind the shutdown
of raves in SF. We have to police ourselves (promoters and party-goers) and
we need to work together.

sounds like a good idea to me, altho most sfravers are probably situated 
more north, so having it further up there would make it more accesible.
	BTW, i've noticed so much more positivity on this list lately.
	so many are thinking now how *we* can improve *our* scene! with 
ideas like this and the vibe patrol...
	
	whatever happened to fresh start?

I agree that searching people is really a problem -- I notice that certain
locations bring out a rougher crowd, and frankly I feel a little relieved to
know that some sort of quick search for weapons is done at the door.  

On the other hand, it can really go too far.  At the Gathering, I was so
thoroughly searched it fully ruined my night.  I mean, I was frisked top to
bottom, pockets emptied, and she even opened up my WALLET and CIGARETTE PACK and
BOX OF MINTS and confiscated my simple herbal stuff.  Now, I'm not some scary
person.  I'm an older smiling woman, in line by herself, and I was wearing a big
funny red hat with Christmas stuff on it, and a green and white jumpsuit --
obviously a free spirit and in no imaginable way someone who would inspire
suspicion by a security guard.

As a result of feeling violated that way, I really did NOT have a good time at
the Gathering, sorry to say.

I do notice that security is often tougher in neighborhoods where the locals are
a little rougher than the usual ravers might be.  Do I want gangs with weapons
at parties?  Of course not.  Maybe we could have signs at the entry point
specifying what's being searched for - e.g. "Searching for Weapons and Alcohol"
- and then ask people to take what they don't want confiscated back to their
cars -- and do the searching in a non-agressive, non-militaristic way?  It would
be nice not to do it at all, but we have to be realistic.

Hey all!

I'm going to try an experiment.  A while ago, there was some discussion 
about an IRC sfraves channel, and as far as I can see, nothing really 
came of it.  However, I am still interested in chatting with you all, 
so I figure I'll try this out.  Tomorrow, Thursday Jan. 18th, I am 
going to start up #sfraves at 8 pm, and see who shows!  Anybody 
interested in showing up & chatting live with other sfravers should 
stop by & check it out!  I have no idea if 1 person or 100 people will 
show, but that's why they call it an experiment!  Anybody who wants to, 
please stop by & say hi!

8 pm!


Love,

p.s.  If somebody has already started an #sfraves-type of channel that

Sorry to bust your bubble, but one group in particular is none to common

        This has been a recurrant thought with me too: how does one
implement something as ephemeral and beautiful as a rave (which i view
mostly as a state of conditions which is a context for the creation of a
new state of mind) into something permanent and practical?
        From Bey's "PAZ" handout (a cheap and ugly 1 page photocopied thing
with handwriting worse than mine on the 'cover' saying "PAZ: the permanent
autonomous zone." Gotta love it!).
        "TAZ-theory tries to concern itself with existing or emergin
situations rather than pure utopianism.  All over the world people are
leaving or "disappearing" themselves from the Grid of Alienation and
seeking ways to restore human contact [but _we_ already know this, don't
we? -B]. An interesting example of this on the level of "urban folk
culture" can be found in the proliferation of hobby networks and
conferences. [like, oh, SFraves & raves in general :) -B]."
        He goes on to ask "What about a poetique (a "way of making") and a
politique (a "way of living together") for the "Permanent" TAZ or ("PAZ")?
What about the actual relation between temporariness and permanence? And
how can the PAZ renew and refresh itself periodically with the "festival"
aspect of the TAZ?"

        Hmm..good question! Isn't one of the beauties of raving the fact
that it doesn't happen all the time? Beauty (for me at least) is often
something that is very sponaneous, ephemeral and completely beyond
language.  Perhaps there _isn't_ necessarily a split between the Temporary
nature of the TAZ and the Permanent nature of the PAZ, probably to see them
as mutually exclusive would be to fall into the mind-trap of Cartesian
dichotomies that has screwed the west up so much. Rather see the two as two
aspects of the same whole :)
        For me, right now, i can create somethign of a PAZ within my own
life, by simply realizing a few crucial but small things: one is that i
have an influence on my environment, another is that i know what it feels
like to have higher states of consciousness than an 'average day' and i
know that those states are tied in with 'the big picture' and that
increases my sense of self (that is, self as part of a larger whole, not my
ego or anything!:) and self-confidence. So, to make small TAZ's all the
time is some sort of reach for a PAZ. And, for me, that means smiling at
random people when i walk down the street.  In the situation that i'm in
it's very uncommon and when i do it, it probably snaps people out of their
usual frame of mind for a second (a temporary second) and they will often
look away immediately, but for a second we had human contanct and i _know_
that they're walking away and *thinking differently* even in a subtle way.
Whether they're thinking i'm baked out of my mind, or whatever, it doesn't
matter just so long as there's that little tweek going on somewhere. :) I
know you DO think differently, your thoughts go onto a completely different
tangent when this happens to you because it's happened to me many a time.
        Anyways, that technique of shocking people (in a nice way!) into
different ways of thinking is small but it relies on something that the
surrealists and dadaists knew: we all begin to expect things and when
things are subtley altered, it can flip 'reality' upside down for a second.
        So, that's some ideas for ya, i'll shaddup now :)
                peace,

        I think that this is not as 'out there' as it may seem. I've been
reading about complex systems and 'hive minds' and other things in a really
cool book called "out of control" by Kevin Kelly (exec. editor of wired)
and one of the things that it sparked in me is this thought:
        If ppl just did what they were DRAWN to do, what they FELT they
should do intuitively rather than what is expected of them by the demands
of our present economic/social structure we'd end up with a really diverse
and complex system of social interaction. Like, if you didn't follow the
whole "get married @ this age, take on this kind of profession depending on
your social/racial/gender/whatever background" scheme you would end up with
total diversity and the system itself would be self-regulating i think.
Like, if all were closely networked (like..umm..on the net? :) there would
be an awareness of "we need more accountants (just for example!)" and so
that drive to be an accountant would be spawned in someone. Any system will
oscillate between chaos and order (or yin and yang or whatever) so that
whenever there would be an overabundance of something the 'hive mind' of
those in the system would recursively feed back the info to the
constituents which would affect thier "Draws" to certain ways of life. Of
course, this wouldn't be a utopia for everyone, there will still be those
within who confuse their draw from the whole network with the draw for
thier ego's need to feed on others by controlling them but hey, nothing's
perfect...yet! ;) haha

This message is in response to the "Permanent Autonomous Zone" thread that

like this:  The Atlantis Project seeks to build a floating city somewhere in

Expansion and development of "land" resources would be privately financed.

Some of us are!

I don't know who you might have met, or at what point, but the San Jose
Posse was just the group of ravers (5 or 10 when the name crystallized) who
lived in San Jose and went to the parties in the city. Since it was the
early days of the SF scene, there wasn't much going on anywhere: Brand new
Wicked every Fri, Brand new Come-Unity every Weds., eventually Toon Town
every Sat., Candlestick FMRs. So when Alan or Quart-Knee or Malachy or
whomever would see the pack of our southbay faces approaching the door that
they didn't see the rest of the week or during the day, we would hear "San
Jose Posse!" ring into the alley. Christmas '91 we all got "San Jose Posse"
medallions (any SF'ers have an "Earth Posse" one still?).

A point I'd like to make is that there was no purpose to all of this except
to go where we could hear the best fucking music we could find (can I get a
witness for 339 Jessie Wickeds?). We felt like outsiders already since we
were the only ones who weren't Brits and we had to travel from the clueless
city we lived in to find acceptable music. So we would go, squrm through our
various ID problems, find a good place to hear the speakers and regroup in
the morning. I can't really remember how much anybody else in those rooms
was going off, we didn't care what anyone else was doing, whether they be
snorting lines in the bathroom or sitting like a wall flower, we were there
with the music in our ears. Nothing else mattered, we did it for ourselves.
I can't say how infectious this was for other people, but from the way I
read how many people look to others for a "vibe," I imagine we helped the
party, since we got our clues from the speakers with DJs fucking ripping it
up on the other end of the wire.

What is wrong with Laurent Garnier, I have never heard that he had a huge 
ego, please elaborate.  Judging someone or saying they have a big ego on 
the account of hersay or just briefly meeting them is pretty harsh.  I know
 I wouldn't like to be judged by someone just on the basis of seeing them 
for 3 minutes or something.  Peoples actions can often be 
misintrepreted.  Keoki is another story, anyone who call themselves a 
"Superstar" does not belong in the Underground Rave scence.  What makes a dj 
different from anyone else,  that is like saying people who fish for 
Tuna have big egos.  I could see how an beginnig fisherman could get 
annoying to a guy like Mr Starkist, if he sat there and didn't fish 
staring at Mr Starkist and bugging him about 
what kind of net he uses, what the biggest fish he has ever caught is, 
how long has he been fishing, and how long his pole is.

Hey All,
	Eric's post about the San Jose Posse got me thinking about
something I have wanted to ask about for awhile, SF rave history.  Since
the timing seems to be right I thought I'd ask people to share what they
know.  I know quite a few people have been on this list for awhile and
know a lot, and I'd love to hear about it (and I'm sure others would,
too:).  When I first got on this list, people were doing their bios which
inherently contained sf rave history. Since then, I've been meaning to ask
for more.  This has already been touched on before, I'm sure, but maybe
the timing is right again, considering the vibe and interest the list has
been generating as of late.  I've checked out the sfraves homepage when I
can, and I think there's a little on there, but I don't have frequent
access to the world wide web to do more indepth "research."  So, I'd love
to hear/read people's contributions about sfrave history, and I imagine
others would, too. 

I'll start it off with my little contribution:  When I was a freshman at
UC Berkeley in 1991, the first friend I met was Brian Behlendorf.  He was
from L.A., I was from the suburbs of Lake Tahoe:] (very rural:), so I had
never heard of raves, nor even drugs like E.  He came up here right after
the peak in the So-Cal rave scene and was always looking for parties in
the Bay Area.  They existed, but I guess they were quite fragmented, and I
never went with him because I was in study-mode in those days.  I remember
him going with a bunch of friends and they always had a great time.  I
remember Brian was very nostalgic about the L.A. scene and sought to
create it up here.  I remember how into music he was, he had more CD's
than I had ever seen in my life!  He made me a mixed tape, not of techno,
but other cool music, that was quite different from the heavy metal I
had:) Anyway, to make this short, I remember when he started to put
together sfraves and even when he had the "rave-nic," I think in Tilden
Park.  We lost touch when he left school, but last year when I got into
raving, and then found this list, it was great to see how much he had done
for the scene.  I remember when he started the list, and it is 
wonderful to see how his contributions have melded things here in 
the Bay Area.  Hats off to Brian--I always knew he'd do what he
wanted! 

Waiting to hear more history,
kc

I went to the Top both nights last weekend, bringing back memories of 
91-92.  Both nights were pretty good - nice crowd, new music, and
low cover charge ;).  Friday was more hiphop/triphop (while I was there),
though you may hear some house sometime, and Saturday was everybody's
favorite, jungle.  Overall, it's pretty casual, and I didn't miss the
stress of long lines, heavy security, bust potential and the large investment
prevalent in the big parties.

Hi Starchild,

I think this Eric Klein fellow has watched Waterworld a few too many 
times.  Lets hope his project is a leetle bit more successful than the 
movie.  :)

Ps: Just joking around, I like your ideas. :)

Hi everybody :)
 I am not anywhere near the sf area, Im up in here in west coast Canada, 
and I love to see whats going on with your guys most escellent party 
scene. Im comin down in a few months too, so i wanna stay 'up' on whats 
going down :)
 Anyway, Ive been following this DJ's have big ego's thing and just wanted 
to throw in my .02 worth.
 Ive been playing music for quite a while, but only recently begain 
playing infront of crowds again. A few parties later I have friends, 
aquaintances, and ppl Ive never met come to me and practically tell me 
they love me because of my set (ok so we have some good trEats hErE too 
:). I love to play music, and every set is a learning experience, but this 
is incredibly humbling. I literally blush and thank ppl to death for 
coming to me after, it rrreally means a lot to me to know that they 'got 
off' to MY MUSIC :) The other day someone told a friend of mine they 
thought I had a fat head because of my dj'ing and this rrrally et me off. 
I am the least egotistical person on the planet..and I had to find out why 
he said this. My only explanation, that it was a hard night...no monitor, 
barely hear the cue, and after my set i was exhausted. My head was done 
in, in morE ways than onE. He came to me...said he enjoyed...talked for a 
bit..and I just smiled at him...didn't say a word. Ok so there were some 
outside circumstances that were involved, but it made me unhappy to think 
that he thought I was fat-headed. I literally fu*&ing love ppl telling me 
they had a great time. Its half the fun of being a dj...

cont...sorry my mailer is whacky...

So, what I would like for everybody to do is this...form your own
opinion...Ive read a lot about Keoki being a twat, but Ive never met
him..so I dunno. I can relate to some of the problems a lot of us dj's
have when playing at a party. On the other hand he could be a complete
whack, but I dunno.
 But if you have a good time dancing or whatEver it is you do, pleas just 
go and tell your friends, tell your loved ones, tell your parents :) its 
what we all appreciate, is being known (doesnt everyone?), but most of 
all, go and tell the dj. As a matter of fact do that first. We may be out 
of sorts, but believe me a person playing music does not a dj make. The dj 
is just like you and me. we like attention, we like having friends, we 
like a smile. If I could be friends with all the ppl i play for, Id be the 
happiest man on the planet.
We also deal with alot of dinks...and sometimes you might have been right 
after one of them. You know how insulting it is..to be told your bunk? Its 
a personal thing..and it hurts.
Well...Im not standing up for any of the ppl (dj's) some of you call them, 
but if Im ever at the decks...please do not hesitate...come say HI :)
Its a shame we can't just do that anyway, but I want to hear from you :)
Than for your guys (I mean that generically of course) time...we'll
see ya in about 3 mo's :)
peace.

I've been getting a lot of questions from people about how to use the 
IRC.  So, I decided to post this for those who are both interested in 
doing it but don't know how to use the IRC.  I'm kinda fumbling my way 
thru this myself, so please try it ahead of time so you can talk by 8 
pm!  These instructions are for people (I assume most of you are like 
this) who just use plain ol Unix accounts, with plain session 
terminals:

At the Unix prompt, type irc & hit enter.  This should get you into the 
IRC where from there you can enter a specific channel.
Once you're in, type "/join #sfraves" & hit enter.  This should put you 
into our sfraves channel, hopefully!  At that point, assuming you've 
made it thus far, anything you type normally & hit enter after will 
appear as dialogue on the screens of everybody else who's on that 
channel. Thus conversations can be carried on real time!  Commands you 
want to issue should be preceded by the "/" sign, i.e. if you want to 
change your nick to something else, type "/nick Shawna (or whatever)" 
and your nick will appear to everybody else as Shawna from then on.

I emailed a less detailed description to someone privately earlier, & 
they mailed me back saying it worked, so hopefully it will work for you 
guys too!

Hope to see you at 8 pm!

Love,
Shawna

hello..well, this posting was more to NE-raves.. it happened to bounce to SF, but, here we go:
 
>	I'm really curious about the scene in Brazil.  I lived in Bolivia for a 
>long time and visited Brazil including Rio.  It was an interesting city.  
>I was just wondering what the scene was like since I didn't think Rio was 
>necessarily "rave" oriented?  What's your story?  Are you familiar to the 
>U.S. scene? 

Until October, i was living in the US and working as a lawyer in DC. Sounds strange right??? yes.. I used to live in DC working on my master's degree in law. i am a lawyer here in Brazil, but I only did not stay in the U.S. because i did not pass the califormia bar. My specialization is Copyright, Trademarks and New media law

My interest in SF is because i have a cousin who lives there, and I used to go visit him sometimes. I love SF, and definitely i would have tried to find a job there..that's why i took the calif.bar instead of NY. I am also trying to get into Stanford, so, it would be good to at least have an idea to what goes around teh bay area.

Rio is not rave related at all..Raves are not popular or really well-known. Also, they are definitely not easy to find too. The rave crowd is a mix of gay people, technoheads, fashion victims and junkies. Unfortunately, many people tend to associate raves here only with "gay and lesbian parties". That's so wrong!! and that's why we are throwing the Qua-Qua events: parties not directed to the gay public, but solely to who's into music and vibe.

 
>	Your posts just came out of the blue on our San Francisco mailing

My mixtape ia avaliable. the current one is more like Trancey stuff.. It doesn't cost anything, except that whoever is interested should send me a tape for teh copy. E-mail me personally and I can provide everyone with the address... The current tape is good, imHO, but i just hope i had time to do a newer one. I am stuck in a lawyer job that takes my whole day.

One more thing:

My IRC is windows based, so I can immediately see an entire list of 
who's on the channel, but for those of you who are using strict Unix, 
once you get into #sfraves, type "/who #sfraves" to display a list of 
people who are already there.  Then you'll know who you're dealing 
with.  It'll probably take a bit to figure out who everybody is behind 
the nicks!

Sorry for this late posting;

at spundae, there was a DJ in Teknotika called who played from 
about 12:00-3:00.  His name was Scott...I don't really know much else.  
(DJ Soul?).  Any details on who he is(?)--because I enjoyed his set a ton, 
and I will definetely come up to see him next time he plays.

Thanks fellow ravers;

I wanna go! I wanna go!
Can it wait until after February 1st so I can go?

And I'm interested in helping, I just don't know what the best way to 
help would be yet. Let me know if you have ideas.

I'm up for a park or the beach, I love both.

You guys should realize that if you were as famous as Laurent Garnier or
Keoki, you would constantly be hasseled by people when you go out.  Lets
say you just played 20 parties in one month and you went to play a big show
in SF.  3000 raving fans at the Richmond Coliseum and you just wanna sleep.
If you just happen to be a little crabby and unfriendly, everyone and
their brother will think you have  huge ego.  Too many people are just
quick to judge...

actually the idea of this kind of zone was started at least 2 years ago 
by aaron wynett, and jen parker, some of the many people behind - you 
guessed it - spaz - or 'semi permanent autonomous zone. for a while they 
lived in a warehouse south of market and called it the TAZ warehouse. the 
semi-permanent part evolved later. spaz then got twisted around to be an 
anacronym for just about anything those letters stood for... but that is 
all the story on this subject i know, in case y'all are interested!!!

Hey all

Thanks to all of you who attempted to show up for The Experiment, but I 
was having horrendous difficulties with my internet service provider 
who kept kicking me off & not letting me back on!  And then when I did 
successfully get on, the lag would be so great when others came on, 
that they would never hear that I was talking to them, and then leave!  
Does not make for a very good IRC party!  But I've finally managed to 
get back on! And now I'm actually chatting with somebody! 

So please, come try again!  It's actually up & running now!

Love,
Shawna

Hello:
I did , after much searching and many tries, got on to #sfraves by typing
/join #sfraves in my command box. I hooked up and chatted with Tim (
knucklehead) for a few minutes, but no other sf ravers joined us ;( I think
this idea deserves a second chance and we should try it again soon. I'm
sorry I didnt get to talk with you Shawna, hope to next time. Its a great
way to meet and talk when you are at home or otherwise away from the
scene.Cant wait to try again.Shawna: set another day to try this out & I'll
b there. Hope to see alot more of you next time.

I wasn't at Spundae, but my friend Scott, DJ Sol (as in sun), 
has been spinning there lately, so that might have been him.  
At any rate, he's been spinning at Spundae's lately and I
suggest checking him out sometime.  He plays great music 
(pretty trance, etc.) and he's also a very friendly guy 
(no ego  =)...   I hope that helps a little...

gee, that sounds really tough, having to play to 3000 annoying fans. Especially
after playing 20 parties which, at $500 dollars a gig adds up to about
$10,000 (and
rates for bigger name djs are usually higher). Not bad for a months work,
even for such torture as playing records for 2 or 3 hours. <end sarcasm>.
Of course I know that that was just an example and that not too often does
someone play 20 gigs a month, but gosh,
Being overworked (which is still their choice) is no excuse for snubbing
off the people
who support their livelihood. just an opinion. Later, Brian.

	This is true, and suggests to me two possible solutions (besides 
the obvious do-nothing option and the ways to decrease the likelihood 
of violence at parties I outlined in the message you quote from above):
	(1) Try to remove the drugs from our scene, or
	(2) Try to remove the violence by getting them legalized, or at least 
		decriminalized.

	I opt for the latter.

	Derek, yer right...i shouldn't judge a book from it's cover.  I just
went off of what I've read in Laurent Garnier's interviews and have gotten the
feeling that he is really self indulgent...however, I never said he was a bad
person and didn't mean for you or anyone else to take offense.  But if one
can't judge as I have, than truely no one knows besides the individual.  You
called me...I humbly apologise to you and your friend(?) Laurent...but that
Mr. Starkist...he's another story!  Don't get me started on that one.....Brrrr..
.....he's a cold fish!

Hey all!

Thanks to all of you who showed up last night on #sfraves, albeit 
unsuccessfully!  I'm actually kinda glad to hear that there was 
something wrong with people's IRC clients, rather than think that all 
of you popped on and didn't speak a word to me!  As I had said before, 
I was having my own troubles, my own ISP sucks big time & suddenly (of 
course!) decided to get completely flaky on me right around our 
scheduled time!  It would kick me off & not let me back on, or the lag 
was so great that no one ever heard what I was saying.  Very annoying.  
Anyway, I will definitely want to try this again, when my isp settles 
down a bit (I think  it's having a tantrum right now), I'll post a time 
in the future.  Hope more of you are able to show!

Love,
Shawna

shawna: 

i think you guys should do this again!  im a irc fiend and would like to
chat with other people on EFnet.  vrave is good, but it lacks the chaos of
being one of 3000+ channels in the great ether cloud of the Inet (+ the
commands are unknown to me).  what i suggest we all do is to all log in to
the same host (provided they are not banning any particular isp: ours is
banned on a few of them).  .....a better thing is to go to the
lesser used underNET.  it is less prone to net-splits and lags. the 
server address is sanjose.ca.us.undernet.org, or for short "/server 
dal.net 7000" .... if not that method, then EFnet: 

irc2.ais.net 6680 (or 6650)
irc.ais.net 6680 (or 6650)
irc.colorado.edu
irc.neosoft.com
irc.mcs.net (netcom is banned)
irc.epix.com
irc.mit.edu
irc-2.mit.edu

anyhow, we can change servers to defeat lag time.  there are effective 
solutions to any problems that one may encounter..
 
so let us know when you do this again... it would be interesting & fun!

ciao!

That's 'telnet', by the way, not 'telenet' (although, there exists a 
telenet...).

before sfr started i was on a shoegazer/manchester music list, which 
occaisionally would have info about sf parties, this was back at the time when 
half the fun and all the work was just to find out about a party......so 
anyhow one day i remember a guy named vitamin B suggested that we take all the 
rave talk onto a devoted list sfraves!!! i think the first party i heard about 
on sfraves, though it might have been the previous list, was the now infamous 
Woopie Ball!!! the rest is history  :)

Hey All,
	Eric's post about the San Jose Posse got me thinking about
something I have wanted to ask about for awhile, SF rave history.  Since
the timing seems to be right I thought I'd ask people to share what they
know.  I know quite a few people have been on this list for awhile and
know a lot, and I'd love to hear about it (and I'm sure others would,
too:).  When I first got on this list, people were doing their bios which
inherently contained sf rave history. Since then, I've been meaning to ask
for more.  This has already been touched on before, I'm sure, but maybe
the timing is right again, considering the vibe and interest the list has
been generating as of late.  I've checked out the sfraves homepage when I
can, and I think there's a little on there, but I don't have frequent
access to the world wide web to do more indepth "research."  So, I'd love
to hear/read people's contributions about sfrave history, and I imagine
others would, too. 

I'll start it off with my little contribution:  When I was a freshman at
UC Berkeley in 1991, the first friend I met was Brian Behlendorf.  He was
from L.A., I was from the suburbs of Lake Tahoe:] (very rural:), so I had
never heard of raves, nor even drugs like E.  He came up here right after
the peak in the So-Cal rave scene and was always looking for parties in
the Bay Area.  They existed, but I guess they were quite fragmented, and I
never went with him because I was in study-mode in those days.  I remember
him going with a bunch of friends and they always had a great time.  I
remember Brian was very nostalgic about the L.A. scene and sought to
create it up here.  I remember how into music he was, he had more CD's
than I had ever seen in my life!  He made me a mixed tape, not of techno,
but other cool music, that was quite different from the heavy metal I
had:) Anyway, to make this short, I remember when he started to put
together sfraves and even when he had the "rave-nic," I think in Tilden
Park.  We lost touch when he left school, but last year when I got into
raving, and then found this list, it was great to see how much he had done
for the scene.  I remember when he started the list, and it is 
wonderful to see how his contributions have melded things here in 
the Bay Area.  Hats off to Brian--I always knew he'd do what he
wanted! 

Waiting to hear more history,
kc

I assume you both are willing to not do drugs until they are legalized,
since you would be tacitly supporting the very same side effects you are
trying to eradicate.

I agree that #2 is the better option, it sure works for alcohol!

Derek:  Actually, at the Top last Saturday I thought I heard Shoban say over 
the mike that this would be the last night of the party.  A sad thing for 
junglists, but I also just saw a flier for a new Jungle night starting at 
Bahia Wednesday night with a lot of the same dj's, including appearances by 
our own Thad and StarEyes.

I went to the Top both nights last weekend, bringing back memories of 
91-92.  Both nights were pretty good - nice crowd, new music, and
low cover charge ;).  Friday was more hiphop/triphop (while I was there),
though you may hear some house sometime, and Saturday was everybody's
favorite, jungle.  Overall, it's pretty casual, and I didn't miss the
stress of long lines, heavy security, bust potential and the large investment
prevalent in the big parties.

	hey kids!

	this'll sound silly, but i filter my mail like crazy,
	and it seems like (i am still checking) sfraves mail
	gets deposited into my work mailbox instead of my
	sfraves mailbox if sfraves' address is in the Cc: line
	instead of the To: line.

	kind of silly, i know, but i do pretty much delete all
	sfr mail in my work box immediately, usually without
	reading it.

Hey kids,

	After two months of searching, I *finally* snagged the latest 
Autechre album, Tri Repetae.  I think it's a genius album, their best to 
date.  Highly recommended.
	I also recommend that everyone go and see City of the Lost 
Children.  This film has the most amazing set designs and imagery since 
Brazil.  The story's good, too.  It's in French, tho, but I think that 
adds to the mystique.  Go and see it.  It's super.

	Take care.  And thanks to everyone who answered my post about the 
mixing boards!

Subject: Herbal Energy Boosters
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

     After getting the dreaded ravers cold last year, I've gone on a bit of 
     a health kick for '96.  The past few weeks I sampled several different 
     types of herbal energy boosters and thought I'd share what I 
     experienced:
     
     _Fungalore_ from Shamanic Tonics in Santa Cruz puts out a blend of 
     fungi and herbs that sells for ~$13 per bottle of 16 tablets.  The 
     dosage is 4 tablets and we used it as an alternative for Herbal E.  
     They caution you to not take more than 16 tablets in a 24 hour period. 
      Among the things it contains is Ginseng, Kola acuminata, ginseng, 
     Ephedra sinica and Ganoderma.  I don't know how it's distributed 
     because a friend gave it to me but it's very pleasant and I didn't 
     throw up, have stomach pains, or have any nasty bowel movements, etc.
     
     I took Fungalore (4 tabs initially and then 2 more several hours 
     later) in conjunction with DMAE, B5, PC55 (Twin Labs Phen... Choline 
     mix), and of course, C.  At the same time, I also took _UPtime_ which 
     has Chinese green tea, kola nut, ginseng, papaya enzyme and lots of 
     other herbal stuff.  You can check them out and even request samples 
     of UPtime to be sent to you on the web (http://www.up-time.com).  
     
     I don't have the exact dosages of all the stuff but the effects were 
     very nice.  Increased energy, clearness of the mind (to bring me to a 
     trance state), calmness, and perhaps because of the people I was with, 
     a good state of connectedness.  The sensations were so subtle that at 
     one point, I just realized that I felt incredibly light and content 
     and realized what contributed to it.  With everything that I took, I 
     felt that it lasted a good 6 hours or at least until I went to sleep.  
     Since I normally don't have much caffeine in my diet, I experienced 
     some difficulty falling asleep but when I woke up, I was still quite 
     energized and in a very centered state of mind.
     
     Two other times I tried Fungalore, once by itself and based on my 
     setting, all I felt was a light energy buzz (speediness) and a clear, 
     centered state of being but another time a friend and I went to Roots 
     and had an incredible time.  It was similiar to the first time I took 
     it w/o all the additive vitamins & minerals.  The best part was that I 
     was able to just go to sleep around 5am, wake up in 1-1/2 hours to go 
     to work and continued feeling very clear headed and energized.  
     
     Another product I've tried is _Energyrise_ from Earthrise in Petaluma 
     (http://www.earthrise.com/spirulina) (~$10-12 per 120 caplets).  The 
     benefits of this product for me is that there is no use of caffeine.  
     They suggest 3-6 caplets to be taken between meals as needed.  Along 
     w/the typical multivitamins included in it, they add Ma Huang, 
     Spirulina, Bee Pollen, Don Quai, Ginseng, & Zinc.  I've taken three 
     pills per dose and after about an hour I feel pretty good.  Again, I 
     get an increase in energy, a sense of centeredness or peace, and clear 
     headedness (or ability of stay focused).  I like it alot and aside 
     from the effects of spirulina, I feel no other side effects.
     
     So that's my brief review on these products.  I really haven't 
     explored nutrition and vitamins as much as I want to but now am more 
     motivated :)  I should also mention that all of these should not be 
     taken if you are taking an MAO inhibitor or any othe prescription 
     drug.  
     
     Have a great weekend!
     
     Love,
     Diane

The people that were doing liquid are friends of mine.  Liquid was name of
the club they...well pretty much he (dj Rig-a-Tony from Sacramento) started.
I'm not sure if there were others involved, but I know they were using
Rig-a-Tony's sound and he would have dj'd there every Friday.  It only ended
up happening for one night because there was some issue of insurance that
got raised.  It was going to cost alot more for the insurance or something
so it got cancelled.  It's lame, cuz there's nothing to do in Sac on
Fridays, and Liquid was free.

I think so, but then again, Rig-a-Tony is a friend of mine.  And if it
wasn't for him I would probably still hate vinyl and house music.  He really
enlightened me when we were roommates.  Now I'm a superstar dj with a big
ego like all the rest of them.....just kidding:)  

See you all in the ambient room at Groove Trip One Year Anneversary.  I
think this one's gonna be a doozy.

word to you....

I remember that once, while I was still living in DC, i was searched in a Rave and they took away from me:

- 4 pens (I mean, normal pens.. not taggers)
- 1 pencil
- a rubber band


And I was coming straight from the law school to the event, so I was in need of all that..the guy just told me that I could hurt someone with those things.. I still can not see how.

Sometimes, the bouncers are not friendly at all... I hate bouncers, anyway.. i just hope we could all go to events and bring whatever we wanted to, and be responsible enough not to bring anything harmful to everyone.

The point i was really trying to make was the DJ's in the real life, everyday living. Not while they are on action.

I happened to meet almost all the DJ's that i personally know in situations other than actually on a club. As a DJ myself, and as sometimes I was spinning before them, I happened to have a chance of meeting some way before the event was going.. In some cases, i even had to help teh promoter while setting up the deals, etc..

this thread happened to come to my head because i have this friend, who now is becoming a well-known Dj, so he now forgets all his former friends, and just want to be around the "spotlight personalities", "newspaeper columnists", etc.. I always tried to open his eyes that this DJ life is not only "fame" and no fortune at all, but, when you don't want to listen..... 

I guess I met a lot of nice people. But, while I was living in the East Coast, I met quite a few fat-heads and idiot DJs..ppl which are heralded all over, and are such jerks that, in one case, If he comes to spin around my country, I'd be the first to go after him..but,to, at least, beat him up.

I guess, at the end, we are just dealing with ppl..some are nice, some are not. You just want to be around teh nice ones.

Well, I was there promptly at 8 last night, but it seems I was the only
person on the channel. Now, I know many of you tried as well, so does that
mean that there were a whole bunch of little tiny one-person #sfraves
channels all over the place??? I hear a few people got it working, but I
had the same problem which I'll bet many others had... everything seemed to
work fine, but there was no one else on the #sfraves that I wa on. Does
this mean that Berkeley has its own little IRC universe that's seperate
from all of your little universes (how mystical :) ??? Anyhow, I tried, I
failed but I'm anxious to try again sometime.

I went to a party in Portland a few months back where the security  
confiscated from me an Odwalla(fruit drink), some Herbal Stimulants, a 
ball of twine, some bagels, and I think a couple of other odds and 
ends.  Fortunatly,they had a check in system so that you could get it 
all back at the end of the night.  Some friends had to take off their  
wallet chains and any studded or chain belts, under the excuse that they  
could be used as weapons, I think.  I don't mind being searched too 
much, I'd much rather keep guns and spray cans and such outside the  
venues, but this was a bit absurd.

As a side note, at the very same party, some guy wacked out on way too 
many drugs(I assume) literally attacked the turntables and Jon Williams 
by leaping onto the decks and smashing one of the needles, not to mention 
a few records.  I guess we should be glad he wasn't armed.

that's too bad... what I do (I too am heavy into philtering) is set the
filter to all headers contain? sfraves so anything related to the list gets
stuck into my sfraves box. Unfortunately, that's rather depressing because
it only cuts down on the mail in my personal box and makes me feel
*unloved* :)

Well there are really two seperate IRC's. The main one, and the undernet. 
I think what added to the confusion was the fact that no one knew which 
net to get on. Perhaps we can agree on a common server to connect to such 
as irc.colorado.edu, or irc.sdsc.edu which will simplify matters greatly.

that's really too far.  at the castro st halloween party they were taking
away parts of people's costumes.  stuff like plastic wands.  they grabbed it
out of people's hands and threw it away without asking if they wanted to go
in or not.

searching wouldn't be so bad if the criteria for the search and which
objects are ok are clearly defined in a written policy so people could know
what's ok and what's not.  for instance, according to the fda, herbal
medicines are just as medically potent as belly button lint or old socks.
some definition of things needs to be made.

Why doesn't everyone just use vrave?  Sfravers can simply have
their own subchanel there.

I'm pondering over the list of events on the eve of the Super Bowl...

Groove Trip: Read one very positive review on the inagural event last
year in the SFR archives. I'm guessing this one is located towards
Sac'to, given the phone numbers??? Sounds very cool, given the lab
set-ups, but is it worth the drive?

Rain Dance Tribal Dance Party: A few of my favorite DJ's here. Hmmm,
perhaps a road trip to Santa Cruz may be in order?

Rhythm Culture: Totally without info here. The phone message sounded
just a tad too commercial, though.

Are there any opinions from the very party-wise and enlightened?

  I'm a wizard on BayMOO, an all-text vr that functions a lot like an IRC 
channel, except with many more options for customizing the surroundings 
and ambience. It would only take me a few minutes to create an SFRaves 
room, complete with dance verbs for those who want to try virtual dancing 
-- or just a place to talk with other ravers from SF or anywhere else. A 
number of SFRavers already have characters there. If there's enough 
additional interest, I'll whomp up a special place -- with posters, too. :<)

        No offense to Laura & Brian B, but Vrave has it's own set of
problems. To many people creating to much lag, that system, & in MY
experience useing it, can for some become unuseable due to the lag thang. I
personally have no patience for it anymore. 

        IRC is way criptic for even some of the most experienced Net Heads.

Galacticomm rules chat, and has always ruled chat, and until something
easier to use, & better comes along dats where you will find me chating.

	While some djs really like to be told that their set was like, I
know a few who get all the reward they need from just being part of the
energy that is produced when everyone dances their asses off - dj puts on
record, the crowd dances a bit, dj puts on next record, plays with the mix
for a minute or two, a couple people yell and howl, dj smiles cuz
something is happening and puts on next record and the energy just pushes
you to play with it and the more you play the more people howl and stomp
and dance and the more you are pushed to spin and play and the better your
record choice is cuz its become much more than just a dj playing and
people dancing, and I don't mean conceptually. I been on both ends of that
connection and it can be really hard to have someone come up with a
certain look in their eyes and tell you they really liked your music, the
way you spun or whatever and then stand there with this vibe coming off of
them which makes you feel like you should know everything right about
then. A dj is just another person, some do it cuz they like the energy, 
they like playing with music and somehow, other people found out that 
they like playing with music and those other people like the way the 
first plays with it and then someone with a sound system finds out... And 
to those people I think the fame thing is scary. To some, pushing out 
some attitude to everyone is a way of keeping away the people who forget 
that you are just another person. Although I think most everyone would 
agree that this isn't the best way of a dj protecting oneself from 
those uncomfortable situations, I think it is much better than going 
along with the game that I must be a god because people will look at me 
that way (which in fact, seems more like a wall of attitude to hide 
behind because that person actually knows they are not much different 
from the next person). In the end, a dj is just a person who is not much 
differrent than anyone else (except they have gotten to see life from 
just one more perpestive), and they will most likely however they 
may seem is more a reaction to however they are approached. If someone 
googles at a dj and then expects the dj to react as if they were being 
treated like any other person, that person had better not complain that 
the dj didn't treat him or her like they a person - did s/he treat the dj 
like a person? Does any friendship come out of one person being 
idealized? I think I am starting to get off my point...

The "undernet"?  Is that like "Underdog", a net that gets super powers by

I feel I should testify here:  My life was ruined by belly button lint.

It all started when someone I thought was my friend offered me some.  I'd 
heard of it, but I didn't know much about it, and since this person seemed 
really cool, I tried it.  At first, it was easy.  I'd have a little after 
work, or on the weekends.  Pretty soon though, I was finding myself sneaking 
into the mens' room at work to dig out a little belly button lint.  I was 
staying up 'til all hours of the night digging at my belly button!  One day 
one of my co-workers caught me trying to dig some lint out of her belly 
button.  Of course I lost my job.  I couldn't make the payments on my car 
and my house.  I lost everything...

Thank goodness there's Belly Button Lint Anonymous (BBLA).  With their help 
and the love of family and friends, I managed to kick the belly button lint 
habit, and now I'm putting my life back together...<sniff>...I've been lint 
free for over a year now.  I wish I'd never started...<sob>...

Belly Button Lint -- just say no!

To anybody out there wondering what Clockwork Tortoise Inc is all about;

We are a group of ravers that run our own video game development company. We do 
design, art and programming for SEGA's game machines. Partying and working go 
hand in hand for us. Raves, the music and the subculture are our inspiration and 
our life.

As for myself, I come from Dublin,Ireland. I've followed the rave scene ever 
since I left Dublin, starting in Manchester,England moving on to LA (where I

So why Clockwork Tortoise? ....well we were kinda stoned at the time and my 
memory is a little cloudy. We didn't want a jerk-off name with "Interactive" or 
"Multimedia" in the title. But personally it is my tribute to the inventor of the 
first clockwork tortoise... I mean somebody out there said "I'm going to make 
this tortoise thing that you can wind up and walks accross your table!" and they 
did - wonderful!

It is a less-populated, less-lagged IRC network.

Yup. In IRC type something like:
/server irc.sdsc.edu

And that will connect you to the specified server.

If Shawna and other people are interested in trying something like 
this again, I will volunteer to help people figure out a) if they can 
use/have the software for IRC and b) how to use it.

To all who read this hello again!

I am using mi amigo's email but if you want to reply -go ahead and I will get
it....

Went to Plastik and had a goo time however I felt I was at a concert rather
than a rave.  I would say half the people were sitting in the seats and
having the dj on the stage - almost away from the crowd on the floor didn't
produce a good crowd/dj bond- know what I mean...

Last Friday I went to a house party at a friends apartment and had a faboulus
time.  :)  Marious spun then Marcus (from Germany) got on the decks and blew
my mind.  He is sooo good.  He spun soe great goa techno and trance that kept
me moving all night -well till the cops came - then Surge spun some of his
discs and I danced some more.  I had a great time and met alot of great
people...

Saturday I went to my first Christalis and has another fantastic time!!
Great job!! I loves the lasers in the techno room and the brekfast in the
morning hit the spot.  Excelent party - Would some one email me the line up
of dj's  - I never made it to the front of the room and never really asked
who was up.  Much appreciation for anyone's help.  I met more sfravers Amy
John and a few more Hello! see ya at the next party! :)

I just got back from MAD and had a great time.  I would have gone last monday
but I had my wisdom teeth pulled -that was painfully fun.   MAD was great and
I'll be backnext week.  

Is anyone going to the free party tomorrow with Jeno, Spun, J. Howard & Simon
etc.?  See you there-  

I'll be back on in a week or two and catch up-

PLUR     ~\_G_|~

YES!!!!

This reminded me of a wonderful quote by Howard Thurman:

"Don't ask yourself what the world needs.  Ask yourself what makes you come
alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come
alive."

When I have actively lived with this sentiment in mind, wonderful people,
things, ideas and jobs have come my way.  Also, in times that are difficult or
challenging, this idea of "going through growing pains in order to become more
alive" is rather comforting and have inspired me to keep going/growing.  In
light of the recent posts requesting "good vibes", I thought this might be
helpful to people.

warmly

=> yes this is key. hard though. as one draws away from what is expected 
of them toward their intuition, anxiety ensues. less responsibility with 
the former. strength necessary and belief in you self for the latter.

I just got a tape of the British TV melodrama "Loved Up" about the
rave/club scene in the UK.  It's supposed to be pretty good, but I
can't see it because it's in the UK video standard.  Does anyone have
the means to do the conversion, or know anyone who does?  Help me and
of course you'll get a dub.

No 24/7 service here! :) I have looked into it, the problem is actually
with ultima.org bouncing a bunch of messages destined for Joe Rice's
account.  Look in the complete mail headers, it'll tell you the path the
messages take and why they are sent, usually.  I have removed Joe for now,
and I'll resubscribe him when his accounts fixed.

There are several video conversion places in the Bay Area. Just let you

goddammit i had strange dream this night...
i don't know whether it was caused by a book i was reading
on mind control in scientology and all that weird sci-fi shit
they teach, or an email i was finishing to someone about music...
but i went to sleep at 5am really exhausted... and maybe the
combination of the two subjects resulted in this...

...well, i dreamt that i went to aphex twin's apartment (kinda like the
apartment i used to live in NYC) and we were talking about electronic
music, and about composing it and stuff... and we got into a argument,
because he just wouldn't tell me how he modulated the frequency cutoff
on his on his equipment.  see, he didn't use MIDI control numbers  to
control the parameters... he used some homemade mystical gadget thing
that looked like a old dirty toaster and he wouldn't tell me what the
hell it is and how it works..!!!.
..and so we started arguing, and i just *had* to know...
i kept saying, 'what's the big deal?! why can't just tell me what you
use?!'
..and then the whole room started filling with a pink foam...
and then the dream switched into something else...
strange huh?

..this was my third aphex dream by the way...

(see, *this* is what you get when you listen to too much ambient-
 you get strange dreams, ...you go tell a shrink...and then he locks you
 up in some nut-house...)

        Totally! What i have found, though, is that when you do choose to
'wander off the beaten path' of what is expected of you, or is the most
'logical/rational' thing to do in a given situation, you find that there
will be strange little indicators that will re-assure you that you're
'doing the right thing.'  I read a bit of this book on Synchronicity
written by...arg, can't remember right now, but it had a quote from Joseph
Campbell that echoed anne's quote from Howard Thurman:

>> This reminded me of a wonderful quote by Howard Thurman:
>>
>> "Don't ask yourself what the world needs.  Ask yourself what makes you come
>> alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come
>> alive."
        The Joseph Campbell quote basically said the same thing: when
you're in touch with what you want to be intuitively, even if it seems off
the wall for you, and you set your mind to achieving it, you find that
there are 'helping hands' that seemingly come out of nowhere to push you
along.
        A lot of times i skeptically wonder if synchronicity is real, or
whether my own desire to believe in it is what makes me percieve events as
synchronous but in the past couple days i've had some coincidences that
were just TOO weird to be explained, and have also driven home both
Campbell and Thurman's point.

        Believe me, it has, and thanks anne :) In the past week i've had a
lot of things happen which have been really tough (getting layed off from
my job and having a lot of my 'plans' for the future rearranged on a daily
if not hourly basis ;) but reading stuff like this, along with having a few
really strange synchronous events has helped me stay 'not so stressed out'
:)
        Akk, sorry this was completely non-rave related!
        peace,
                brad

hi y'all...

for me, this kind of stuff IS rave related because this is part of rave 
culture, for me.  weird synchronous stuff always happens at raves for me 
along with other types of "experiences" like coincidentally meeting 
someone that you wanted to meet or wanting to meet you (right, wayne? :) 
and all that stuff...so, like i said, for me this is part of rave 
culture.  i'd like to get feedback from you guys on this topic.

love,

bren, aka, shakti

Hey Brenda!

I'm inclined to agree with you.  I've been going thru a lot of changes 
lately, that relate to this thread, in the past few weeks, and I do 
attribute a part of that to raving!  At Chrysalis I had a very 
spiritual time, and it's changed me somehow, and that's stuck with me.  
So raves, among certain other occurrences in my life as of late, have 
definitely played a part in this.  But after all, isn't that really the 
point of raving?  Peace, Love, Unity, Respect, good vibes, good energy, 
evolution, etc?  I find myself surrounded by unconditional love & 
people who feel like I do.  All these are things everybody says are a 
part of raving, so I guess there should be no surprise when I actually 
find myself experiencing these things!  So yes, it is definitely rave 
related in my book!

Love,
Shawna

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Well it was truly a weekend of the Good, The Bad, & the Ugly. I went
to Overdose on Friday @ the Acme Warehouse, it was a great Ghetto Rave if ya
like those things. The Gansta Vibe was strong; with plenty of crank & crack
to smoke. No one seemed to dance for very long, I guess the crack/crank just
kills any good vibe.

        I kind a felt like I was in a rave at San Quentin, couldn't tell the
security from the thugs. I stayed through Tracy & Mar's sets and then left
for the less hostile ground of 1015 Folsum. I noticed not one DJ seemed to
hang around for very long after their sets. It was really hard to see a
place like the Acme Gallery, where we've put so much effort into making the
space environmentally really nice & comfortable be totally devoid of
decoration, less the graffiti.

        Needless to say I didn't have a very good time, put it was there
first party, a $15 party ta boot. Lets hope they either make something
unique for themselves as far as putting a rave together goes and/or take a
little direction from the rest of us, and follow suit.

        As for Saturday night, hats off once again to C^3 Warehouse for
having a space that runs a close second to the greatest place in SF to throw
a party, old Cyberlab HQ on Bryant Street. Thanks also for keeping it core,
and not going for the greed.

        This place is just soooo cool, from the vagina doorway to the well
done day glow decorations everywhere, to the beautiful people that produced
a overwhelming love vibe, to the DJ's who spun da Trance, & to all those who
make da music like SF's very own Peter from Kode IV, true devotion to the art.

  I showed up at about 3:45. The music was going strong, with dancing and 
juggling -- OK, *I* was juggling  :<) -- and erica (sp?) spinning. But 
the generator quit at the same time that the weather started to dig 
beneath my jacket, so I/we left. Many thanks to the folks who put it on

I saw you there... pretty impressive: five or six balls at once?

I was pretty disappointed by the breakdown myself, and I left a little
after four. I wish it had worked out for them, I really feel bad when silly
little technical problems cause so much trouble.

You might have seen me sitting on the wall with my friend matt: blue jeans,
sunglasses and a "where the wild things are" shirt.

	That's a big assumption there, Eric... :)  Interesting dilemna 
though, I'd never really considered it that way.
	Frankly, I think curtailing my use would be sending the wrong 
message to the authorities:  It would contribute to the mistaken idea 
that the War On Drugs is working, thereby encouraging them to perpetuate 
it, with the resulting continuation of the violence.  
	After due consideration, my decision is that I will continue to 
break the law.  It is not for nothing that Dr. Martin Luther King said 
unjust laws deserve to be broken.

Yours in liberty,

	On the day when they search me and take away my belly button lint

That party was a complete waste of money.  Especially after chrysalis last
weekend.  The soundsystem at Overdose sounded like a home stereo.

        CCC or C^3 Warehouse, is, & I hope remains a private Trance
facility. It's location is not really a secret, but I will not publically
post it to the Net, because people live & work there. I do not believe it is
for rent, unless you were a close personal friend of someone who lived there. 

        I wish C^3 had a computer, actually I believe they do, so speak for
yourselves people!!!!!

        No argument from me there, I agree totally, but again it was there
first party, even though I thought it bit the big one. However I spoke to a
friend on the Haight lastnight who said that he had a killer time dancing
all night, go fiqure.

        Fred, you use to run DOS/Text based BBS Sytems, how bout some help.
Well anyway dis is what I know about Gallacticomm after happially useing
them for over 5 years? The service; Liberty BBS is a Gallacticom/Major BBS.

        What is a Gallacticomm? The company Gallacticom was a BBS Management
Software Developer. The company was started in Flordia by a kid when he was
going to highschool. Gallacticom is the name of the software, and if I'm not
mistaken some propriitary hardware as well. I believe that any BBS running
the software was refered to as either as a Gallacticom or Major BBS.

        The software allowed the sysop to run a multi-line BBS system that
offered unique chat features to it's users. Along with alternative chat/mail
networks like chatlink, worldlink, ....etc enabled many Major Net BBS's to
communicate through out the world with each other. Worldlink mail can take
up to 3 days to reach a destination, compared to the Internets minutes. But
it was a WAN that was available to the general public before the interent
was, I believe anyway.

        To answer your question you will proablly have to pay pennies for
this service, but it will cost you. You actually may be able to find it for
free, but Gallacticom software was kind a expensive so I doubt it.

greetings.  the problem was not a "mail bomb"; rather, a user configuration 
error on ultima.org.  my apologies to all, on this list and others, for
any inconvenience.  we believe the problem has been solved.  please
report any similar problems involving ultima.org to me.  thanks.

sorry to lengthen an already long post, but im sure there are some who 
would be interested in the entire line:

anyway, i think fear is really the factor impeding the flow of 
intuition. fear is really self-created, and i heard this really cool 
title of a book actually, called 'love is letting go of fear' this is SO 
true!!! the whole syncronistic phenomenon is interesting as well, 'cause 
somtimes i think that the universe is acting out energies(remember you 
cannot create or destroy energy, just change it... did einstein say 
this?) through us, and we notice this in the form of syncronistic events. 
and if we let our fear choke off this natural flow, then we feel more 
anxiety and more fear, but then again the fact that one is choking off 
the flow of natural syncronistic energy is ok, it is all good, and this 
is part of the syncronistic energy in the first place?!?!?!? just a large 
circle of energy, all boiling down to love. weird huh? does any of this 
make sense?

Sorry about the non-rave post, but is anyone out there going to the Tom Waits

BLEH!

I would give my second foreskin to see Tom Waits.  Alas, I too am without 
tickets.  I didn't even know about the concert until three days after it 
had sold out.  
I posted to usenet to find tickets, and actually got an offer today, but 
the guy said bidding would *start* at $100.  I cannot afford anything 
like that.  
So, my spirits are with you, and I also hope to hear about the show from 
a friend.  

	good luck,

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        I thought anyone interested in upgrading to that 28.8kbps would find
it interesting, and it's true, well at least the technical part. The first
part is scarey, but I hope you find it both amusing and informative.


Digital Communications  - By Hank Volpe
The Myth of 28.8 kbps Communication

A scene sure to be repeated in every computer-enhanced, politically-
correct household on holidays, anniversaries, or birthdays; The loving
and devoted life-companion, knowing that their significant other 
wishes a modem of higher speed, spends long hours browsing 
catalogs, shopping at computer stores, watching home shopping
channels, looking for the 28.8 kbps "screamer" that will satisfy 
(although real satisfaction can only come through one's self). A 
purchase is made, and on the appointed day,  the "gift" (offered by an 
equal as an equal, never as one gaining favor with the other)  is 
unwrapped from its recycled newspaper cover. The other, knowing 
that they have been given a cherished gift, thank their life-companion 
in a kind, human and non-sexist way.  The day closes, finding our 
mutually-bonded individuals basking in self-assured reaffirmation, one 
with their lives, nature, and their computer. 

What could possibly shatter this terribly 90's, terribly correct peace 
and contentment? An un-named person wishing to enter the 
relationship? Nay, for that possibility has already been discussed, 
planned, and documented in pre-nuptial agreements. Perhaps one life-
companion has received a promotion? Nay too, for we have learned 
that accomplishments in the world are transitory at best. No, this 
relationship, this politically-correct myth, is shattered by the shattering
of another myth... the myth of 28.8 kbps communication. After the 
modem is configured and setup, the tension, frustration and agony 
erupt along typical "role-playing" lines. The household returns to a less 
enlightened time, when men were men and women were women, and
modems were "beasties" that never worked right.  

Myths play an important part in our lives. They shape our thoughts and 
our actions. When our myths change, our culture changes too. Unlike 
lifestyle, myths have no place in the computer world, yet we deal with 
myths spawned by inflated promises in advertising every day.  Think 
of some of the myths you know of such as;  a 66 mhz computer is 
twice as fast as a 33,  or 16 megs of memory is more than you will 
ever need. Its now time to add another busted myth to this group; the 
myth that V.34 will support 28.8 kbps and even 33.6 kbps!  The fact is, 
given our present telephone system, any connect speed above 19.2 
kbps is iffy at best!  Granted, some modem manufacturers do a better 
job of implementing V.34 than others, but still even the best modems 
have consistent problems connecting above 21.6 kbps.



Our current phone system is a network. The local exchange funnels 
connections from home and offices  to other locations both inside and 
outside of the local exchange. Connections between exchanges are 
done via microwaves, fiber, digital, or carrier (modulated) services.
Usually, within an exchange, telephone calls are clear and relatively 
noise-free. Interconnecting the network  introduces "impairments" that 
hamper high speed communications.  The following is a list of these 
impairments;

Bandwidth
--------------
Static or scratchy voice calls are very annoying.  As a function of 
frequency, static is higher than most voice communications, so the 
phone company installs roll-off filters to suppress noise higher than 
human voice frequencies. These filters limit the "bandwidth" or 
maximum frequency response of the telephone line.  Bandwidth is 
very important to high speed communication.  At 28.8kbps, 3200 
symbols per second must be sent.  These are modulated (turned into
audio tones) so that they can be transmitted on the telephone line.
The lowest tone is 229 hz, the highest is 3429 hz, for a total bandwidth
of 3200 hz.  The higher the bps rate, more symbols (character and
error correcting information)  are transmitted.   Below is a simple table
showing these relationships;

BPS            Frequencies     Bandwidth
---------     -------------   ------------
21.6 kbps      400-2880 hz      2400 hz
24.0 kbps      274-3018 hz      2744 hz
26.4 kbps      300-3300 hz      3000 hz
28.8 kbps      229-3429 hz      3200 hz
Phone          700-3000 hz      2300 hz

Problem #1; the average telephone line's bandwidth is limited to
between 700 hz and 3000 hz, for a total bandwidth of 2300 hz. V.34
equalization ( a trick to boost bandwidth) does extend the bandwidth
some, but it also brings up noise as well. This noise can contribute to
disconnects and garbled data. Therefore, V.34 will "fallback" to a
slower speed until it thinks it finds a connection speed that works.
Notice that 21.6 kbps is so close to what is considered normal phone
bandwidth that it is sure to work most of the time.



Digital Speech Compression
------------------------------------
With the explosion of modems, cellular phones, and fax machines, the
phone company is simply running out of circuits to interconnect local
area exchanges. Additional microwave frequencies are scarce
because the current microwave band is at capacity. The long-term
answer, fiber, is costly and takes time to install. As a result, some
phone companies have started using digital speech compression .
Just like compressed files, compressed speech takes less time to
transmit. Several phone callers can be time-multiplexed or frequency
multiplexed to share the same telephone circuit. This effectively
increases the capacity of the existing telephone network.

Problem #2; such compression effectively limits bandwidth to the point
where connections at 14.4 kbps become iffy as well.  Although this
used to be strictly a "rural" problem, such compression is now
becoming a "big-city" problem as well. If you have problems getting
connections above 9600 bps, or if 14.4 kbps is the absolute highest
speed  at which you can connect, you may be a victim of digital
speech compression.


Wall Jacks
--------------
High speed connections require clean physical interconnections
between your modem and your telephone. Wall jacks and telephone
chord connectors are made of copper or other metals and are subject
to corrosion and loss of spring tension because of age.  Try plugging
your modem into another wall outlet in the house. If that works,
replace your wall outlet.

If problems persist, clean the RJ-11 jack (the connector at both ends
of your telephone chord) with a rubber eraser. The eraser removes
corrosion very nicely on copper. Make sure you air-blow out any left-
over eraser particles before you re-install the telephone cable. If this
works, invest in another phone cable.

Finally, most modems are designed to loop the telephone line through
the modem and to a voice instrument. Remove the telephone
instrument and see if the problem goes away. Some inexpensive
modems have poor isolation between the load of the modem and the
load of the telephone instrument, and this can cause high-speed
problems as well.


Calling-Out Problems
---------------------------
If you're having problems connecting with a certain BBS on a certain
exchange, try another BBS on another exchange. The interconnect
from your local exchange may pass through many other exchanges,
some of which may have problems interconnecting to still other
exchanges. Isolating the problem to a certain part of town won't make
things any better, but you'll know the problem isn't in your house wiring
or your modem. This also works for long-distance calls as well. Some
area codes are notorious for bad connections, while others work well.
Also, depending on your long distance provider, you may experience
problems only with long distance and nothing else. Early on, I had a
similar problem with one provider and switched to another, which
solved my problem.

Configuration Problems
------------------------------
Finally, we get to the point where you most likely started which is;
blaming your modem. Sad to say, that some modem manufacturers do
a poor job of implementing the V.34 standard. To figure out your
problem, start at the basics. First of all, if you are connecting at
speeds below 21.6 kbps and you are sure its not your telephone line,
double check the following;

1) Is the DTE rate (rate between modem and computer) locked and
set to a speed of at least 38.4 kbps. "Locking" is a technique used by
high speed modems. The rate of exchange between modem and
computer stays at a fixed speed regardless of the speed the telephone
connection between modems. You need a DTE speed greater than
your highest connect speed to have good throughput, and with some
modems, if the DTE rate is lower than the connect speed, the modem
will fallback to a lower speed.

2) Are you using an error-free protocol?  Not to be confused with file
transfer protocols, error-free protocols insure good connections at high
speed. V.42bis should be your choice in nearly every case, however,
some manufacturers have done a poor job of implementing V.42 bis.
The symptom of this problem is that you will have a good connection,
eventually leading to one of these problems; keyboard freezing,
dropping off of file transfer speed until the system locks up,  or failure
to connect at any speed above 4800 bps.

If you experience these problems, check your modem manual and
switch to MNP protocol. MNP-4 or MNP-5  will still work effectively
with most high speed transmissions.  If this happens to you on a
particular BBS, then you know that system has a bad V.42bis
implementation. If it happens to you no matter where you call, then
contact your modem manufacturer and see if they have an upgrade of
the ROM code used in your modem.  You should also be aware that a
few modem manufacturers will not admit to such a problem right away.
It took several months of pressuring for one manufacturer to admit
they had this bug and for them to issue ROM corrections.

3) Do you fail to connect at all? V.34 modems will switch down to a
minimum speed of 4800 bps. If the BBS you are calling uses a slower
speed than this, you will never connect. In this case, you will need to
instruct your modem to callout using V.32 instead (this is usually done
with the &N switch in most modems).

On some systems, you will also fail to connect if you fail to establish a
V.42 or MNP connection. In this case, the BBS computer will usually
disconnect you. In this case, just call back. Sometimes modems fail to
properly establish V.42 or MNP connections because of line
conditions.

Conventional Wisdom
----------------------------
You can't help feeling a little frustrated when you first get a 28.8kbps
modem. But before you lash out at your modem, yourself, or your "life-
companion", take a moment to analyze what is going on. Realize that
28.8kbps connections on our current telephone system is a myth. The
only reliable way to get continuous 28.8kbps or higher connections is
with an ISDN line and an ISDN modem.  ISDN is more expensive than
normal telephone service, heavily "tarriffed" in some areas, and not
available in others.

Finally, I want to shatter another myth which is; the faster the
telephone connection, the faster the file transfer. Wrong! A properly
configured modem at 21.6 kbps will transfer a compressed file only a
few hundred characters per second slower than a 28.8kbps
connection. Data compression yields less transmit information at any
speed. True, a typical compressed download at 21.6 kbps yields about
2300 cps, while a typical 28.8 kbps compressed download is about
3300 cps, but most connections of 24.0 kbps or 26.4 kbps are in the
2600-2800 cps range.  Its not worth complaining for 300-500 cps. You
can loose that just simply by writing data to your disk drive or when a
BBS briefly interrupts your transfer during a multitasking session.
Furthermore, if you are using a slower computer or a non-buffered
uart, your top 28.8kbps compressed download speed will rarely get
above 2900 cps, making the download "gap" even more narrow.

Now....go out and hug your life-long companion and thank them for the
wonderful gift! Realize that your life is now better since you realize that
28.8kbps connections are an ideal, a perfect system for a perfect
world. A myth to guide you, and nothing more.

"Fear is the mind-killer..." -Litany Against Fear, Frank Herbert

Fear is a good thing, if acted upon -- it keeps us from doing 
stupid things.  However, fear not acted on becomes worry, which
is a useless emotion.  If something worries me, I should either
do something about it or quit worrying.

And I will add a "Yep" to the chorus of people talking about 
synchronicity.  When doing the right thing, each step along the way
feels right, as it approaches a desired goal.  This doesn't mean 
everything becomes really easy, just satisfying.  True, this 
is a tautology, but it's easy to forget in the blitz of consumer
culture designed to make you fulfill someone else's desires
instead of your own.

Why else would we ship out to chilly beaches in the middle of 
nowhere with no facilities and lug a bunch of equipment around
just to dance?  It's the right thing.  There are countless 
reasons advanced by others as to why we should do the wrong thing, 
and it's very easy to rationalize that "that's the way the world
works" or "you're being naive and idealistic" or "cool people don't
do that anymore" or flat-out "you can't do that".  Pshaw!

I wonder how many other drug-legalists view the War on Drugs as a matter of
pride, that letting the prohibitionists think they're "winning" is worse
than any possible good that might arise from that situation? Anyone out
there care to comment?

I'm just looking for ways of changing that don't involve cool people getting
shot. And hey, just because they *deserve* to be broken, doesn't mean they
*must* be broken. I think there can be other ways.

I buy stuff from Audio Images Corp in San Francisco. They are on Oak Grove
Street (an alley near the norteast corner of 6th and Bryant).

You may also want to call JK Sound in SF. They rent and possibly sell
equipment also.

To George & all: don't be to sure about that location.  Groove Trip is being
pretty dern sneaky on this one.  And even if it does end up in Sac, think
about some of the best partys you've been to, and tell me that a little
adventure wasn't involved!  Hmmmm?

Happy B-Day G.T.

I have heard that Liquid Groove is going to be at The Grind 
in West Sacramento. This is the same location as Parthanon in 
August. It's the new skate park. Good size.

It will be a great party!

See ya there..... :)

Hey!

Well last night was my first MAD, and it certainly won't be my last!  
Boy did I dance my ass off, even tho I had to be at work the next 
morning!  Very cool place.  Met a few new sfravers, of course (hi Jonas 
& Christina!), along with seeing some old ones.  Absolute blast!

A slight clarification ....

Resident DJs for MAD are: Joe Rice, Alex, Jon Santos and Ethan...

2 of whom play each week with one varying guest who usually plays the
middle slot.

Up-to-date, night-specific line-ups can be found at:

  http://www.bass-station.com/FnF/Events.html

It is $1 before 11, $3 after, is open to anyone 18 and over w/ ID and runs
from 10pm - 2:00 every Monday night at the Bahia Cabana in S.F. at the
corners of Market and Franklin streets.

Last night was just insanely *MAD*, excellent sets from Jon, James Dee, and
Alex  =)

Many thanks to everyone for the continued support, can't tell you how much
we appreciate it!

take it easy
ethan

i think its a hopeless waste of money. drugs are a part of society wether 
we, or they like it or not. theres plenty of history to prove that, and 
the $ could be used on better things, like, say, education? but then 
again, its much easier to govern an uneducated general public.

other ways? if theres a way to legalize this stuff, id like to know how.

Hi there, I was in Honolulu last week, and found monday night at the
Jungle was really good, the crowd and club was small, mixed age group, the
Dj's were friendly and played some great tunes, they even played some
tracks I was curious about, good video as well, he's sending me a copy. I
can't remember their names, but can find out if anyone is interested. It
was free entry and the music reached dizzy heights around 1am, some great
pumping techno, the kind that builds to a crescendo and has everyone
screaming with joy. The club stays open till 4pm and after 1am the crowd
builds.  
I went to the Groove but it was very disappointing it played
mainly industrial,and old Depeche Mode songs (Retro time warp!!! blahhh)
with the odd dance (techo or house) track, the flyer was very deceiving.
One thing though, there was herbal ecstacy and smart drinks, plus a bar.

 If it's still in business , try visiting the "Funk Pistol" store
near Ala Moana Shopping Center. I don't remember the name of the 
big street it's next to - I'll try to look that up when I get home.
It's a small place upstairs off of street level - seems to be
a combination clothes store/music/spray can culture place. They had
DRC tapes! And local event flyers , plus flyers for LA events.

Those of you looking for something to do this weekend, may I suggest
Dub Syndicate playing Great American Music Hall Friday and Slims on
Saturday.  Also Pacific is doing a party on Friday.

Hey

The following is a bit of a sob story, so those of you who don't want 
to read it should stop here! 


I'm in sort of a dilemma here.  Somehow I feel the urge to ask for a 
little help, maybe it will do some good.  I just got a call from my 
ex-boyfriend, and he doesn't appear to be doing well.  We broke up a 
few months ago, and I thought he was ok with it, but he seems to be 
really depressed, and it actually kind of scares me, from the way he 
talks.  Things like "It's killing me, you've given me the death 
sentence" and "I'm gonna be this way for the rest of my life" and "I 
hope you have a good life".  I don't know what to make of this, I hope 
I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it really is, but I can't help 
worrying about it.  This is someone I loved very much, but 
circumstances beyond my control changed the outcome of the 
relationship.  I am no longer someone who can help him in any way, and 
I feel guilty about that, but I tried for 3 years to change that way of 
thinking in him, and it never did any good, he was not willing to 
change.  I know that I cannot do anything for him now, and I have no 
real way to tell him this.  I must sit silently by and watch him 
continue downwards, with my hands tied behind my back.  The real thing 
I'm worried about is obviously suicide.  We had a close friend in the 
past who was confronted with the same problem my ex is, and resolved it 
in that most selfish of methods.  My ex idolized this person, because 
he was sort of a father-figure when his own was lacking, and I fear he 
may decide that a similar course of action would be suitable for him.  
Now comes the help!  I don't know if this would do any good for him, 
but maybe we could all send him some good energy, he is in such 
desperate need of it and doesn't even realize it, it's about the only 
thing I can think of to do for him.  Maybe it'll hit him & he'll have a 
change of heart without realizing why, & he'll drag himself out of the 
pit he's dug himself into.  I would very much apreciate it! 

My love and thanks to you all!

Shawna

Sorry about this non-rave question, but I'm pretty sure that one of
you sfravers knows the answer... .

Why does my Korg poly-800 keep responding to all midi channels when I
tell it to respond to only one????

Does anybody happen to know how to make the korg poly-800
deal with midi properly? I've tried to loop the midi-in and midi-out 
before using it (this works with lots of old midi-synths), but it
does not do the trick.

 Hello All 
 I don't post very much and am a lurker if there ever was one, but I felt the
need to say something about the recent posts about synths and the TB-303.
There great. To all the people who say that synths and music gear are "not
rave realated" need to get a clue.  I would rather read 100 posts about music
gear and the 303 than one about how someone got some bunk 'E'. It seems to me
that alot of people don't know what raving is really about. It's the MUSIC.
Without that there would be no D.j.'s, no dancing, no raves, just a bunch of
people sitting around high, and I thought they called that a crackhouse. 
  I just wanted to say that I think that synths, dj equiptment, and music
gear are more a part of raving than drugs, fashion, and politics which seem
to be constantly talked about on SFRaves.  
   If this seemed like a flame, I'm sorry, that wasn't my intention, it just
seems like people forget what this is supposed to be all about and that could
be the end. Thats how I feel when I read post upon post about bad drugs and
who's ruining OUR scene with their attitudes and dance style.     ENOUGH...
        
                    music is life is love...

Shawna your friend might be in some need of some professional help, 
possibly hospitolization.
To assess his level of suicidality it can be very helpful to ask some 
direct questions about it.  If you don't feel comfortable doing that, I 
suggest you get a professional to do it if you can.
It's immportant to know if he has any specific plans, a means(a gun, lots 
of drugs to o.d. on...)
How long has he been thinking about it, does he have a timetable if he 
does have a plan.

Some realistic implications that pose a serious threat:
1. Mood- does he seem depressed (sounds like he does), loss of appetite, 
loss of energy, sleep disturbance, dirty, fatigued.
2.Is he isolated,not much of a support system, impulsive, 
3.Does he or is he drinking alcohol or such like related drugs.  These 
can reduce inhibition and increase impulsivity.
4. Does he have any history of past attempts.

If these fit, I would suggest professional help asap.  If he is at a 
point where he seems very determined and you want to save him, you can 
call the police to have him hospitolized.

sorry for getting off of rave related info and not taking this private.  
Thought some of this info might be of some help to others some day (hope 
not).

        I need some help here guys, so how bout it. Anyway dis is what I
know about Goa Trance.

        Goa Trance, like Cyber Trance, Heavy Trance, ...etc is a style
within the genre of Techno. Goa Trance differs from Trance because & most
basically it is usually from a place in India called Goa, though it can be
from and anywhere in the world. There is some really happenin French Goa,
that's rocks. It is usually above 140bpm, and is impossible not to move you
body to.

        I like t because I have a very active mind, also most hypomanic, and
a fantastic imagenation that I usually keep to myself. Whether ON or not it
takes me on a journey, gives my day or night dreams a musical backdrop, or
score for them. I just really dig it.
Also it like most Trance, is possibly more pshycoactive than House or other
form of Techno, at least for me anyway.

        That's about all I can articulate myself with reagrd to GOA Trance,
so come on Trance Heads speak you mind, and bring some awareness to this House.

Did anyone read the article on SF 's DJ's and dance music scene?  It was
ok, but kinda focused primarily on acid jazz and "world beat" They
mentioned the Wicked Crew and Tomas amoung others (Cheb-i-Sabah) It also
mentioned how vibrant the whole new music scene is here as opposed to other
places, something most of us have probably known for quite a while.  Anyway
check it out. p. 32

P.S. is it only me, but does it make ya feel a little strange(concerned) to
read about this stuff in mianstream media?

	While I agree that a few lines about the equipment thtat make 
electronic music is more prepinent to this list than drug talk, I take 
offense at being told what a rave 'is about'. Raves are a lot of things 
to a lot of people - for some it is the music, for some it is the people, 
for some it is the general odd atmosphere that you can find ain only a 
few other places, for some it is the huge combination. If music is the 
only thing thing you like about raving, why do you go out? Why not 
befriend a Dj and lounge around their house while they practice?

Anyone out there want to loan (or rent) me thier 303 for a week or two?  

or two of them, or 4 even!!!
::smile::

I have all the parts written I just need to record the 303 performing them...

I got tricked into thinking that the Novation Bass-station could do 303 
style sounds, but it's not nearly as tweeky sounding.  

please contact me if you're interested.

TIA  ::hug::

        IMO.  "goa" trance is the "cheesy" or "unintelligent" side of 
trance.  Trance without passion.  It's the only trance that isn't trance 
inducing!  I believe it only earned a reputation as being "goa" because 
record companies tried SO hard.  WHY?  Maybe because it is totally easy 
to mass produce.  
        I think goa is the opposite of underground.  The difference is in 
the artist's intentions when they create the piece of music.  If it was 
intended to trance them out, it will end up being more underground.  If 
it was intended to sell records it will end up being more "goa"ey.  
        It is hard to tell the difference at first, or distinguish what 
is actually cheesy about it at all...  But it is NOT a product of the 
underground.  When I and my friends go shopping for music, it has turned 
into searching for the things that are the LEAST goa-ie.  

        as we like to say...  

        goa-way

        Hope that helped.  =)

        ::hugs::

        BTW.  there is absoulutely gorgeous -blow your mind- trance out 
there...

        !love!  e

A few suggestions:

I have the Rising High Trance Injection 2CD set, which I'm very pleased
with: it isn't very "goa," but it's good stuff, similar to Moonshine's
Psychotrance 1 (another good one) except it's not mixed. Moonshine also has
a Psychotrance 2 which IMHO isn't nearly as good as #1. Also, look for the
Blue Room Released Vol. 1 CD: sounds very, very Goa. has a good Juno
Reactor song.
Another good CD is Southern Fried House from sm:)e. There's a little bit of
house on it (mostly from the Mighty Dub Kats) but it sounds like mostly
ambient/trance, despite the name.

-mikey.

So I'm sure everyone watched President Clinton's State of
the Union address yesterday, where he outlined to congress
and the American people his vision for the future of the
country.  I thought things got interesting at the end when
he was talking about working together, finding common
ground, etc.  He signalled to Al Gore, who pressed a 
button, and all of a sudden music started playing.  Most
people looked a little confused, but a few started dancing
and pretty soon the entire place was on it's feet cheering
and shouting as the strobes kicked in; the highlight  for me
came when Senator Alfonse D'Amato and Hillary hugged each other...
And then I woke up.

        Ed, would you please clarify whether it's YOU personally who do not
like Goa Trance, or are you saying Goa Trance as form or style of Trance is
in bad taste, or artistically undesireable?

You are joking right?
You obviously dont know anything about Goa-Trance..maybe you dont like it, 
but thats another story.
Cheesy? Unintelligent? Do you even know where Goa is? Or what It and many 
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvery un-commercial  countries, states and provinces 
have given us who play music in the underground scene. Or wait a better 
question, what do you consider "underground"? Earned a reputation? record 
companies trying so hard? WHY? Why did you post this if you did not know 
what you are talking about? Maybe because it is totally easy to 
unjustifiably slam something that you obviously know nothing about.
 I think you are the opposite of underground.
 Go slap in your 2 Unlimited cd, and contemplate that term.
 Goa is one of the best movements techno music has seen in ages. Not 
everybody likes it, but not everybody likes Ambient or Gabber either. But 
not for reasons like thinking (and i use the term loosely) it is cheesy, 
or not "underground" enough.
 You sound just like the people that say all ravers are bad because they 
all use drugs and will not go to heaven.

I remember arguing this point a few months back with one of this list's
more volatile posters. He said   that it was the people that made raves
interesting, while I said it was the music that brought the interesting
people there in the first place. A couple months after that exchange, I was
at a party talking to a guy on the dance floor. It was a cool conversation,
though not too deep given the volume and the physical movement. When one of
my favorite tracks (a Union Jack tune) was mixed in, I shouted something
like, "wow! Isn't this music amazing!?" The guy said, "yeah, I guess so...
I really come to these things for the people..." At first I was kind of
disdainful, but then I started questioning why I thought my experience was
any more valid or profound just because I appreciated the music more than
he did. Who's to say that electroacoustic vibrations supercede those given
off by interesting people?

Mind you, I still generally follow my favorite music whereever it may go,
and I inevitably find my favorite raver people there dancing to it. Still,
the majority of my friends - certainly those not into the rave scene - do
not share my fixation with trance and techno. It doesn't lessen my
friendships, it just means we tend to talk about other things.

I've come to the opinion that good raves are symbiotic interactions of
music, people, vibe, DJs, visuals, and even the space it's located in.
There's no one centrally important element. As such, I think that's a
pretty good analogy for everyday life itself.

take care!

Hey Ed,

>From what your description of Goa trance (psychedelic trance) it seems that
you probaly haven't *really* listened to it.

To me it is the most powerful underground movement in the world 
Look what is happening in Israel right now, their government is
putting pressure on the indian government to stop the parties in goa,
because all the israelis are going there after their tour in the army and
are totally flipping out. Their all going back to 
Israel and having joint parties with the palastenians - imagine that. What
years of negotiations has not accomplished a music
so powerful has. And it is not only Israel it is happening all
over the world. ]

A lot of people say you need to be on drugs to apreciate goa trance. All you
really need is a open mind and really listen with your heart and then you
will see that the music is very organic in nature, that the melodies are
always evolving, and are not just looped samples. 

In by your definition of underound you are stating that goa isnt 
underground because it has a mass apeal and unification of various sounds so
that people from all over the world can dance together as one, then yes,
mabye it is commercial. My personal belief is to make the underground
culture the norm in society and 
the commercialist, bankers, tree cutters etc. the outcasts.


                         PEACE LOVE AND TRANCE
                
                        HAPPY ALIEN LIFE FORCE

Ooooo...  This sounds like the "is the glass half full or half empty" phrase 
for the '90s:  Do you rave for the music that brings the cool people, or for 
the people that gather when there's cool music?

To me Goa is like most other genres or sub genres of music. Some is great 
and some isn't. I usually go for stuff that has heart and imagination. Of 
course it always ends up a rather subjective thing. Music and dance help 
me celebrate the beautiful things in life and feel more connected to 
those with which I share this planet.

Peace through music, dance and genuine Love.

In a message dated 96-01-24 01:31:22 EST, you write:

<< Things like "It's killing me, you've given me the death 
sentence" and "I'm gonna be this way for the rest of my life" and "I 
hope you have a good life".  I don't know what to make of this, I hope 
I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it really is, but I can't help 
worrying about it.  This is someone I loved very much, but  >>

I can relate with this kind of talk, but sometimes it is just to make you
feel guilty.  When my X said stuff like that, it made me feel really bad and
made me want to fall back and give it another chance, if they sound so
desperate you think they might change. So watch out this could possibly be
his motives.   In my case, I fell back into the relationship 1 too many times
(3 years)  and finaley I came to my senses and realized changes were not
going to happen.  It is very hard when you love that certain someone very
much, but know you need to get out because your not happy.  I would watch for
signs that others have given you but try to keep your distance, if he knows
he is getting your attention the more he will keep scarying you with his
threats.  It is just human nature I think for a lot of guys to react this way
to break ups.  Sorry guys!!!

In message dated 96-01-24 01:31:22 EST, you write:

,,Things like "It's killing me, you've given me the death 
sentence" and " I'm gonna be this way for the rest of my life" and "I
hope you have a good life".  I don't know what to make of this, I hope
I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it really is, but I can't help
worrying about it.  This is someone I loved very much, but  >>

I can relate with this kind of talk, but sometimes it is just talk, to make
you feel guilty.  When my X said stuff like that, it made me feel guilty and
sympathetic.  Actually made me fall right back into the relationship,
thinking if he sounds so desperate, maybe he will change.  In my case, I fell
back into the relationship 1 too many times (3 years) and finaley came to my
senses that changes were not going to happen.  So watch out this might be his
motives.  It is hard when you care and love someone very much, but you know
deep inside that person is not right for you.  I would watch for signs that
others have told you, but keep your distance, if he knows he is getting your
attention, the more he will keep scarying you with his emotions.  It is just
human nature I think for a lot of guys to react this way to break ups.  Sorry
guys!!!!

        I just wanted to add a few non-rave (well, ok, raving _is_
partially about being happy to be alive but anyways..) thoughts on the
suicide/depression thing.
        First is that Seasonal Affective Disorder may be a problem lately,
it's hellish being in montreal where i walk around smiling on overcast
snowy days to see everyone bummed out! Remember to get lots of full
spectrum sunlight if you have a feeling this is you :)
        Also, generally speaking, what i've learned about depression (after
being through it for most of my life is that the crucial thing about
depression is _knowing_ what it is like to be happy. If you don't have that
to measure your mood against, you think that you're 'normal' when (at least
with me) you were miserable. Suffering is not normal, being depressed is
not normal and while everything _is_ somewhat relative, you still have the
power to be as happy as you want. but you have to want to!
        best of luck with the situation, shawna,
                hugs,
                        brad

Since quite a few of you seem to be interested in finding good trance 
compilations on CD, I thought I make a list of the ones I have and recommend.
Here goes nothing:

Trance Nation 1-6+95. 2 unmixed CDs + 1 mixed CD. The only bad thing 
about these CDs is the low sound level. :) (and the second CD on #6 is 
just a tad bit too housy for me...it's still trance though.)

Rave Mission 1-5. 2 unmixed CDs. Volume 5 is a "jubilee box" and has an 
extra mixed CD. It's not only trance, some acid and rave as well.

RaverMeister 1-2. 2 unmixed CDs.

Dream Injection 1. 2 unmixed CDs.

Cosmic Cubes 1-2. 2 unmixed CDs.

HyperRave 1-4. 1 unmixed CD. Somewhat commercial trance (close to some 
euro even), but a good compilation.

TranceMental Music 1. 1 unmixed CD. Hardtrance from Cologne, Germany.

Nordic Rave 1. 2 unmixed CDs. The best of Scandinavian trance. Get it!


These are a few of the ones I have. They are mostly german trance and 
kick ass! If you want to know more, just let me know! =)

It's not as ambiguous as a cup of water. If we read the question closely we
can see that one group needs other people there in order to be there, the
other people being the ones who were there for the music before there were
enough people to attract the crowdlovers.

Oh, that's it, ruin a perfectly good catch phrase for the 90's <dripping

Mr. Darkness,

I sometimes wonder why you post so often. Is it because you *truly* have
something to say, or is it because you enjoy seeing your bright smiling
ASCII repetively conveyed for us to wade through?

I'm curious how you recieved the post you list below. I never created any
such post, nor do I appreciate having any such post relayed to the list
without my permission.  

Are you making things up? Is someone posting with my sig? Or is there
perhaps another Jonas on this list? 

To clear the air, I like House (yes, the thing you - and the rest of us -
live in). I might own a Trance record store, but I love House music. Kinda
crazy, I know, but I was always one for doing something different.

I feel my involvement with Frequency 8 (the store, not the parties) sets a
precedent for many who have become set within one genre of music. There's a
LOT of underground music out there. Whatever genre you prefer, I feel it'
all heading in the same direction - to facilitate the opening of our minds
and encouraging the seeking of a higher conciousness.

So be it House, Ambient, IDM, Trip Hop, Goa, Jungle, or whatever, it's all
good music. Just DIFFERENT - get it? Different strokes for differnt folks.
Who's to say what is better?   

I find it ironic for a community as open minded as ours, that we can be so
divisive as to our musical tastes. What a bunch of hypocrites.

Please advise and explain yourself at your earliest convenience.

later...


Jonas Judd

[ to those folks on SFRaves who are involved with last night's Jungle 
  evening at the Bahia ]

 My apologies for leaving early ( I was the guy in the black shirt with
the colorful KPFA face logo on it ). I just got an attack of dancefloor
shyness - I didn't feel like being out there with just a few folks or
nobody else. Almost everyone seemd to be talking and drinking with friends,
very little dance action by 11:15PM. 

 Maybe next time I'll try to get into some of those conversations! ( Not
my style , tho' ). The music sounded great - I must come back when there
is a crowd that starts dancing earlier!

I was there.  I played at that show.  That was Rig-a-Tony's record.  I
remember we were doing the ambient room when he came running in and grabbed
a record and ran back out, then I heard it.  I wasn't having a very good
night, and didn't get into the circle when it formed...but I watched, and it
was pretty beauitful. I remember the ambient room had tons-o-bleed through
of sound from the main room.  There was only a sheet of plastic seperating
them.  I could not hear what I was playing even with the monitor blasting in
my ear.  I was beat mixing some slow kinda dubby stuff and royal screwed it
up.  I couldn't even tell at first that it was messed up cuz I couldn't hear
it.  Then Tony looks up at me like "What the fuck are you doing", then I
hear "Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha...Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha"...coming from the music in the main
room.  It was the first time I heard the song "Don't Laugh".  It fueled my
misery to unprecedented hights.  

Well, the whole scene was alot different for me then...I didn't really feel
it like I do now.  Can't wait til Sat.

I'm afraid I only caught the last posts on this subject, regardig what
sounded like some advice on dealing with someone who mentioned suicide: I
would like to input:  BE CAREFUL, you're all in the right peter,  suicide is
real, and like aids or drug abuse it isn't going to go away when we turn our
backs.  Ian (Nutralight Visuals) Lillibridge was my best friend for over 10
years.  He commited suicide just over 3 months ago, much to the surprise of
myself, his girlfriend, and the entire sacramento scene.  I am not an expert,
but peters advice seems well said.  Perhaps have a mutual friend talk to him
and assess the situation. The only advice I can give is to do everything you
can, but be cautious of immersing yourself in the process.  Your friend is
the only one that can truly make a differnece in the outcome.  I can also
tell you that strangely enough some of the signs I was aloof to with my
friend's suicide were an increased level of creativity and spirit in his last
days, an unusual socialness.  And I guess some subtle references to suicide
methods were mentioned to his girlfriend, at this point I would consider the
situation very dangerous and not hesitate to have him/her hospitalized.  Take
care of yourself, and keep in touch.
Love & life,
Steveo

Gabber is related to "techno"
it typically moves over its victims at 200+ BPM
and says fuck and bitch a lot....

i love it!
the classic "gabber" (meaning the best example) is
from an artist by the name of Delta 9 and his
"Hate Tank" album on the Drop Bass Network label.

This is your brain on gabber...

	I think the BPM can be dropped to about 180+. And a lot of the 
samples have nothing to do with "bitch" and "fuck". Maybe my 
characterization is wrong, but this is what I took as gabber when I lived 
in Scotland:
	180+ BPM
	hard hitting kick drums
	has dark undercurrent (the strong, well defined kick of the kick drum
		helps with this).
	No divas

	Some current records like VDD Energize's Belgium Frites have no 
reference to any type of "obsenity" but it is hard and dark as hell. I 
have heard that the Kotzaak releases are the same and if Rebecca will 
surface in Oakland I can tell you from personal experience.
	There was this sound system called Sativa that did a fornightly 
club and the occasionly free festi (with a few other systems) that 
provided the environment where I came to appreciate the energy that 
gabber can produce. Imagine 200+ people crammed into a basement where 
everyone is shoulder to shoulder and there is a dripping off the ceiling 
cuz everyone is sweating but you don't notice the heat cuz the music and 
the people are both making you dance harder. And the harder you dance, 
the more energy there seems to come frm the music which makes you dancee 
harder which makes the people around you dance harder cuz they feel the 
energy coming off you and then you have to dance harder cuz their energy 
is filling you up to a point where you simply cannot not dance harder 
(you might think you are going to get very tired soon), but this energy 
just keeps going round and everyone keeps going til it ends and the 
Sativa drummers do their thing and everyone has this big smile on their 
face on the way out (into the freezing air of Edinburgh with steam still 
pouring out of the door you just came out of).

i apologize for the length and the messiness. comments are welcome.



aced themselves in oppositon to the integrity of the bounded nation-state.  	So-called "youth" cultures or "counter" cultures have always delighted in their rejection of and separation from dominant cultural discourses such as mass or popular culture.  While the separation of what I will call "underground" discourses, the catagory in which renegade parties or raves fall into, may be physical and ideological, they are tethered to popular culture by the media.  "The idea that authentic culture is somehow outside media and commerce is a resilient one...that grass-roots cultures resist and struggle with a colonizing mass-mediated corporate world." (Thorton, 176)  In this excellent article on "Moral Panic, the Media and British Rave Culture," Sarah Thorton amends Bordieu's framework and discusses the subcultural capital of the underground.  In particular, it is the economic indiscipline of youth, that are in the stage of life "exempt from the...accumulation of ecomonic capital."!
   The primary difference between s
ubcultural capital and economic capital is in how it ages; subcultural capital deteriorates with age, as it is specifically defined against popular or mass culture, which can be associated with older age groups.  Thorton claims it is not the police that are the antagonists of the underground, but the media, who threaten the very boundries of this discourse by "[continually threatening] to release their cultural knowledge to other social groups." (Thorton, 179).   If the cultural knowledge of the underground is, via the media released to other social groups or the mass media, it changes the subcultural capital and  in effect makes it not as underground or not as cool.  This may affect the raves themselves, forcing them to become more underground, and less accessible to those without a knowledge of how to get to them.	The police have an important role, as someone pointed out to me that it wouldn't be fun without the police, but from personal experience I believe it would be. !
  They form a huge part of the "oth
er" from which a space is taken and ultilized, and also more tightly binds the community against a common enemy; there is a shared sense of transgression, it is a terrorist act to claim space that does not belong to us, in the name of freedom to gather and dance.  Without the police to maintain the integrity of the bounded nation-state, there would be no social drama played out almost every night of the week in cities all across the countries- seemingly empty streets and warehouses from which a visceral throbbing eminates, and as as you get closer, if you look up to the high windows, you can see flashes of light and lasers.  There would be no breach of legality in noise level and drug use and people packed in tighter than cattle, their collective sweat dripping off the ceilings.  The police are highly symbolic as well as represent a very real potential for coming directly into conflict with nation state ideology. 	Nation state ideology, along with specific kinds of culture !
 form the boundry against which und
erground discourse itself is formed.  If the culture industry is truly a monolithic machine that spews out culture as easily as industry spits out tubes of toothpaste, then culture's role is to unwittingly subjugate the consumer back into capitalism, as if he strayed away in the first place.  Underground discourse tries very hard to break away from as well as spit in the face of capitalism and mass culture.  The culture industry works inside of the boundries of nation state ideology, and patrols its borders as well.  The content of art, or movies or any other type of "culture" may attempt to say something about the overweening culture machine, but the production, distribution and what materials produced it all were supplied and therefore controlled by the culture industry.  Underground discourse must participate in the system of prduction, but only so far.  Records and sound systems are bought, as are other items, but in many cases these parties are free or cost very little,!
  to cover only the cost of produci
ng the event and therefore,  in Marxist terms there is no surplus to be recycled back for the further production of capital- the cycle is broken.  	One kind of underground that has been very popular in the Bay Area the past five years has been the Full Moon Rave.  Held on the full moon, it aligns itself with another very ancient kind of underground discourse, the pagan.  These parties have been held at beaches up and down the Northern California coast and the ones I've attended have been held at Bonny Doon in Santa Cruz.  These parties are free and lately have had to start very late at night (1 or 2 a.m.) to avoid being shut down by the police.  "...beach.  Cove.  Cliffs. Pale green fields of brussel sprouts.   The pregnant moon over the ocean.  Royal blue. Dawn peeking yellow, orange, pink.  People searching for community."  (Kathy, personal communication)  Especially in Santa Cruz, this party brought together especially diverse elements of the population- there was a home!
 less guy stationed at the top of t
he beach threatening all who entered not to litter.  Wanna-be hippie kids with their dreads and nitrous balloons, the homeless and club kids, fashionably dressed with shiny shoes and stylish clothes.  They were all gathered around small fires, trying to keep warm and sharing water and dried apricots.	This was the essence of community.	In industrialized nations especially where passages through life are demarcated by aligning oneself within institutions that produce ideology, individualism can be signified by aligning oneself with a culture that defines itself aginst dominant or popular culture.  Underground culture believes that it struggles against mass media and the corporate world, that it represents an authentic, as opposed to popular culture.  Criticisims of mass culture as forms of entertainment claim that it merely serves to reinterpellate the consumer/worker into a system of production.   This rebellion against mass culture is a ideological as well as a physical reb!
 ellion.  It isn't illegal to gathe
r 500 people together at 11pm on a Saturday night in a sactioned spot to watch yet another cutsey Christmas tragicomedy that reinforces notions of what this culture relies on as "family", "religion" and gender roles, yet gather together 500 people, mostly young, to dance to techno, and suddenly you have an illegal situation requiring police interference.  		"The whole world is made to pass through the filter of the 	culture industry.  The old experience of the movie-goer, who 	sees the world ouside as an extension of the film he has just 	left...is now the producer's guildine.  The more intensely and 	flawlessly his techniques duplicate empirical objects, the 	easier it is today for the illusion to prevail that the outside  	world is the straightforward continuation of that presented on 	the screen." (Adorno & Horkheimer 1980)The culture industry serves to reflect commodity and worker culture and reinforces the roles that one plays in both.  Culture therefore patrols the!
  boundries of the nation-state, bu
t the nation-state patrols the boundries of culture- it is a cyclical interaction that involves finanical and ideological controls.  Ultimately, the state holds the power and authority that can be physically enforced.   	It is the looming threat of what the state can do to an individual that is on the minds of the organizers and ravers.  This knowledge binds all who are at an underground together, with the fact of them merely being there that threatens the integrity of the nation state.  Undergrounds threaten the ideology of the culture machine as well as the ideals that subsume human bodies to the maw of the nation.  They provide resistence against the cuture machine and break the cycle of production by providing commodities- the physical party and the subcultural capital without full participation in the system of production.  Victor Turner's notion of a social drama is useful as well to contextualize how the individual is actually breaking with a specific ideology and jo!
 ining another.	The template of Tu
rner's social drama is as follows:  breach, crisis, redressive and reintegration.  (Turner 34-35, 1987) The breach separates members of a group from everyday society, and takes place when one steps inside the space of a rave.  They are, in effect, are consciously choosing to accept the illegality of the space and simultaneiously rejecting the hegemony of governmental controls.  The crisis is the space of indeterminantcy or liminality- the rave itself.  Many raves go off without a hitch, but  many are shut down by the police and people are arrested.  I will discuss a particular case in a bit.  The space of liminality exists for the entire length of the rave.  There exists a palpable unknowing whether or not the police will show up.  The redressive part of social drama returns the participants back to the realm of society supposedly changed from their experiences, and reintegration is the ongoing recongnition that this particular "social group" will not be accetped and integra!
 ted into the society, because of i
ts illegal actions.  It is possible though, for the media to have some integrative effects by making undergrounds a part of mass culture.	  In one particular case, a personal experience on New Year's Eve 1994, the state did intervene, in the form of the police and the ABC (Alcohol Beverage Control), creating an actual "crisis" with redressive/reintegrative action still being played out.  	At four in the morning on New Year's day, in a warehouse in 	the SOMA district of San Francisco, the police and ABC arrived 	to break up on of the best parties I had ever been to. I had 	gotten there twelve hours earlier to help set up and the vibe 	of the place was so strong it had kept me going the whole 	time. There was a main room playing techno, a smaller disco 	area and an ambient room filled with bean bag chairs, and 	crowed with people. The party was the most diverse I had 	ever been to, mainly gay, and everyone was friendly.  I was 	curled up with some friends in the ambient roo!
 m when the 	lack of noise in the m
ain room drew our attention.  The lights 	had been turned on and the room was filled with several 	dozen cops and what we would find out later were ABC agents. 	The bliss had been suddenly and irrevocabley broken, and the 	vibe would soon turn violent.  The police rushed everyone out, 	but a long line formed to retrieve their things from the coat 	check. Suddenly, groups of police were wrestling party-goers 	to the ground.  Disbelieving the fierceness with which this 	party had turned ugly, I rushed to get my camera and 	starting snapping picturces of the police in action.  Soon I 	became a victim of that violence as I was grabbed from 	behind, my head ground into cement by a black boot and my 	camera was ripped from my hands.  Part of my New Year's 	Day was spent in jail, along with the eleven others who were 	arrested.  We are now in the process of sueing the City of 	San Francisco for the violence enacted upon us and the 	violations of our civil rights.In this case, unl!
 ike most raves, the warehouse was 
the residence of the party organizer and he had initially gone to the police and received what he thought where the necessary permits.  Another element to this party was that it was thrown and primarily attended by gay men,  and in San Francisco especially there is a long history of police violence against orgainized gay activies, themselves a marginalized group, bounded and othered by a patriarchial and homophobic discourse.  Although this party was not a rave, per se, it is a useful case to contextualize social drama.   The breach was entering what most partygoers (including the host himself) thought to be a legal party (which was an AIDS benefit) at which donations were encouraged.  Even thought the party was assumed to be legal, it was the sexual orientation of the parytgoers that engendered the breach, as they were all too familiar with police action in the past.  The crisis occured at moment the state, in the form of the police, entered the building, placing all those !
 inside at risk of being in conflic
t with state discourse, and an unlucky few became physically involved.  The redressive action started with the arrests and jailing of the "offenders".  The action of arresting and "processing" those who are found to be in conflict with state ideology carries a certain cultural currency and frees them changed- in the eyes of their fellow citizens and the state itself, which may require them to participate in the judicial system.  Ironically, the only way to undertake any redressive action, especially after you have been arrested is through their own bureaurocratic channels.  In this case we were lucky, the gay community was fed up with their marginalized status and lawyers took on the case pro bono.  The reintergration part of this particular social drama is involving suing the City of San Francisco.  With much political pressure, the Chief of Police has been required by the Mayor to subject some of the officers to discinplinary action.  This is an exceptional case, with an e!
 xtensive history that allowed it t
o go this far.  The media, in the forms of television, newspaper and radio have had a part, as have extensive networks of individual and concerned organizations, in making the public aware and making the nation state, in the form of the police and local government responsible for their actions.  Reintegration, according to Turner involves "reintegration of the disturbed social group, or of the recongition and legitimation of irreparable schism between the contending parties."  If the social drama runs its full course, the final phase "consists of actions restorative of peace" (Turner 35)  In this case, reintegration of the group is not possible as it is bounded by homophobia and the unacceptability of so called "alternative lifestyles" that essentially do not affirm the culture and ideology of the nation-state.  Restorative actions, which are currently tangled in the judicial process, the only legitimate form (to the state) of restorative action avaible,  just reinforces thi!
 s "irreparable schism" bewteen the
se bounded cultural entities.   	This example reinforces that the state, while composed of individuals always presents a monolithic facade, the police are a symbolic as well as a physical force.  That night they were wearing non-descript matching blue jackets over their uniforms.  There badges could not be seen and it was only the yellow SFPD emblazoned on the back of the jackets that signified they were part of the police force.  One of the attendants of the party kept yelling "Get their badge numbers. Get their badge numbers"  He was carried bodily and thrown into the same police wagon I was in.  That is what he got for brushing up against the state's boundry.   As part of the redressive action of this social drama, the Office of Citizen Complaints, themselves patroling the liminal space between legality and illegality- monitering the behavior of the police, was responsible for interviewing those that were involved.  Those interviewed got to view individual  pictures of p!
 olice officers and could point to 
them if they felt they were involved.  As a result of this, several officers will be subjected to disciplinary hearings.**badge numbers/faces= individual**	Because the breach with nation-state ideology is so easily made, it goes just as easily the other way, the breach is too easily realized and dealt with by the state.  Therefore, it must be acknowldeged that raving is not outside of culture.  It can, however, occupy a liminal space between legal and illegal and create a sacred space apart from, though not exclusive of production,  a space that is lacking in our culture for many people.  The space a rave occupies is physical and metaphorical- in many cases, a warehouse or a public beach becomes temporarily reclaimined and reappropriated from a secular and industrial space and transformed into a sacred one.  		"Undergrounds and renegades [parties] are inherently 	subversive gatherings.  They do not pay for the right/	permits to dance, they reclaim public land and  	parti!
 cipants often expenrience higher/i
llegal mind 	states." 						- The Little Red Rave BookThe leglity of the space is usually in question, at once taking the entire event and placing it into a liminal space, as according to the law, it is illegal and therefore subject to legal discourse in the form of police action.  There are variations on what is termed a "rave".  With names like "Roots", "The Gathering", "Friends and Family" and "Kundalini", they can the form of a large or small gathering and have dj's spin techno and ambient music.  Often the participants are engaged in a psychedelic mindset, from the music, drugs, vibe or some combination.  The production of a rave is not outside normal capitalistic modes of production, rather it seeks to use them and subvert them, in effect creating resisitence.  The principle difference between raves is those that seek to profit, normalizing capitalist modes of production within an underground discourse, and those that put on raves with the intention of creating comm!
 unity within that same discourse- 
production as play.  "Big raves and clubs do not pose the same threat....they create a heirarchy...[and] encourage divisions by having guest lists, fixed door prices...and overbearing security." (The Little Red Rave Book)  Both kinds of raves are usually put on by collectives composed of dj's, organizers and volunteers.  	There are three principle types of media that have a role in rave and greater underground culture- the internet, micromedia and print media.  The media serves a dual purpose, the first and most important to the subculture is communication, the other serves to parlay this so-called "scene" to the realm of mass culture which may have political outcomes.  The creation of a virtual community allows relationships to be maintained and parties to be planned.  There are mailing lists for events in the Bay Area and all over the world and there are forums for discussion of the planning and execution of raves and well as how well they went off.  It is an almost steri!
 le form of interaction compared to
 the quick and easy social interactions that take place at undergrounds, though it is necessary for the continuity of this community.  Micromedia are the flyers, often a genre of psycedelic artwork within themselves- they get posted on windshields of cars parked at parties and are available at suitably hip stores in major cities.  Print media which popularizes underground parties takes away some of their subcultural capital- they're no longer thought of as hip by the die-hard ravers, who either have stopped going for a while or are forced to make their parties less accessable and parlays them into mainstream youth culture.	A parallel can be drawn between the subsuming of human nature and individulism to the overweening culture of the nation state and the disappearance of the sacred, once occupying the place of opposition to the secular.  A blurring occurs because of the shift in what is considered "sacred" or "secular" and how they have become defined.  Some aspects of cult!
 ure, it can be argued, such as art
 and music have become utilized to create a respite from the secular, a sacred space that serves to remind us that there is more to life than work.  But if, as Adorno and Horkheimer argue, the products of culture we use to distance ourselves from everyday life and work institute us closer to them, then what is truly sacred space?  	In defining the rave as sacred, in opposition to the secular in culture, raving can be termed a ritual act or performance, or ritual play, according to Turner.  It is not so much that the actions one undertakes at a rave are ritualized, it is the mass experience of communitas, catharsis, and ecstasy- the shift away from what is regimented and secular.  The enactment of a rave is also a part of Victor Turner's notions of social drama fitting into his larger framework of play and performance.  The entire rave is a performance- a political and social one that demonstrates the ability of a collective to amass and transform secular space.  So why is i!
 t a sacred space and what are the 
components that would make this communitas?  	The secular world consists of specific events and interactions that differentiate it from the sacred.  There is work, buying and selling and carefully controlled interactions with others, a complex web of symbols that create and control society.  These actions all make explicit class distinctions as well as race and gender, and serve to separate people and create antagonistic relationships.  Sacred space is a healing space where people are brought together with differenent intentions and a common purpose, namely the creation of a community through music and dance.  "House culture and rave  culture are all about ecstatic expression and opening yourself up, and that's the attraction; I think that's what scares a lot of people, because it's so foreign." (The Cult of the DJ 68, 1994) The rave is a transformative performance that contradicts the separations of the social world.  It is a safe space of play in addition to political spa!
 ce.	It is important to not take f
or granted the roles our senses play in perceiveing and interepreting the world.  In the secular world, beyond our visual sense, they are rarely stimulated.  Control is key- control of our emotions and our impulses.  You could say that the secular world has been ritualized by work and how we interact socially to provide continuity and control. The sacred world makes a point of stimulating our senses to "awaken" us in other ways.  Raves stimulate the sense, rather, assault them.  Turner uses the term sensory code to denote the change the senses perceives in a performance or specific cultural space. (Turner 23) The room is usually hot, the music overbearingly lound, incense is burned and mixed with the smell of bodies.  Touching or hugging others is one of the final barriers of secular culture that is broken- these are the sensory codes of this particular space of performance and play.  Drug use is partially responsible and conducive to physical interactions that are not prece!
 ded by ritualisic encounters (in t
he secular world).  To embrace other people- hug and caress them and be caressed, this is one of the common practices of ecstatsy.  Entire groups of people, under the influence or not will spontaneouly form to cuddle and hug, a very physical acceptence into the social body.  The touch taboo of our society is broken- strangers are embraced and words are usually not necessary.  "What is your name" comes after, if at all, your personhood is the most important thing, the name is merely a marker.   	Dance and music and what most people would consider the most important elements of a rave and they stimlate the senses as well.  Dancing is a sacred, as opposed to secular act- it is the essential part of participating in the rave.  The way we move in secular space is conditioned by social norms and acceptablity and displays a capitalistic mindset- superfluous movement is unnecessary and unproductive, dance is ecstatic and sensual, "exuding gratitude and joy I dance.  When I dance I !
 am the interpreter." (Kathy, perso
nal communication)  It is also part of the collective performance of the rave.  For many people, a rave is the first place they learned to dance.  They felt comfortable enough in the atmosphere and driven by the rhythm to move and as some would argue, a collective surrender to a righteous vibe.  The DJ is very responsible for that vibe.  Why techno? Why is a single genre of music responsible for an entire underground discourse and all its parts?  As Patrick Farley describes it, "the music was a muscular, relentless, overpowering the lower chakras, a hard current into the human sex drive." (1991)  People describe not being able to stop dancing, being driven by the music.  Music which ironically sounds like machines.  He continues.  		"Mr. Floppy's crew pushed the music up to an impossibly 	higher level of intensity.  After non-stop for six hours, I 	believed myslef completely drained of energy but amazingly, 	found myslef sucked back onto the dance floor by an ineffable 	wh!
 irlpool of energy, surrendering my
 body and mind to that 	thundring beat.  Surely this was the same experience 	described by fire-walkers, Bacchanalians, Sufis and yogis 	throghout history, that moment whn the human body 	transforms into pure electricity." (Farley 1991)The beat is hypnotic and some claim that a mass trance engulfs overcomes the participants.  		"The Cult of the DJ" was part of a symposium on popular music and was a forum-style discussion by DJ's, music critics and others, that centered around the role and responsibilities of the dj and how he (very ususally a he) interacts with his crowd. Variously described as a collective experience, a community and a bodily experience, they all acknowledge that there is an electricity between the dancers and the DJ, they feed off of each others' energy. In this way the DJ is repsonsible, to an extent for what people feel .  "Part of the pleasure that the audience indulges in is giving up all of it's agency, becoming passive, becoming subject to the DJ's!
  will." (The Cult of the DJ 71)  T
hey build their reputations on good sets.  A good DJ is like a good lover, they can sense what you're feeling and they know how to work you to take you to higher levels.  DJ's are also "glorified consumers".  They "have access to records unavailable to other people, and they seen to be a part of an elite consumer club."  (The Cult of the DJ 72) To play their music, they must participate in some form of production, that is, they don't get their records for free, but in many cases they do play them for free which can be seen as resistence to the system of production.  	Dance, music with an unrelenting rhythm, sensory codes, and liminality- these are all part of the underground experience and compose the rituals which sucks the raver into a different space and plays out a social drama in which we all take part, actively or passively.  It is the pleasure that one experiences, the cartharis that you feel physically and knowing that you are ideologically breaking barriers that is!
  seductive about the underground. 
 There is a real sense of freedom and participation in that community that is together out of mutual desire to create joy and love.u

I caught a little of the new jungle party at Bahia last night - it
seems to be starting pretty strong, so check it out in the weeks to 
come.  Then I stopped by Roots/Black Diamond for their action - a 
decent crowd too.  

This weekend, the Groove Trip and Rain Dance parties seem to have the
biggest lineups; I'm not sure where they're supposed to be though.  I
don't know exactly what the Mixman thang is, but this weekend's party has
been scaled down from the original plan.

If anyone really wants to thank me for the calendar, you can send me
some Tom Waits tickets ;)...

hello all-

this saturday, i. matthew d. p. k. lanier, being of sound mind and body, am
turning 21!  i would love to usher in my newfound majority with a good rave,
and would love to celebrate it with sfravers.  

my question-  where are people going this saturday?  i would love to see as
many of you as possible, considering that i am a rather different person
than i was when i started raving, due to the wonderful people in this scene.

so, let me know where you're going!!!

also, send me some energy, for i just broke up with my girlfriend of 1 1/2
years, and am still in a state of shock.

but hey, i am now free!  FREE!  FREE!!!!!

peace, love, and birthdays-

matt l.

seismic is going to go off! i predict a rictor scale of 9.5, so hold on to
seats boys and girls.

line up: Sabastian from spiral tribe (junglist from the UK), DRC (the tribal
acid dominatrix), spun, and i think rubin and tracey but not sure about these
last two. 

location: 3rd wave dance studio at 24th and mission. 

check it or you'll be sorry.

i also know that full house is going on at miss pearl's jam house (i think
that's what it's called). so if you like deep house check this out.

hope to see you at seismic

Hello all,

Please visit http://www.travelpartners.com

Please enter the drawing!!!

My partner and I have a web development company.  We met (in the hot tub of the
now infamous "Blue House" of Santa Cruz) after a 92 Funky Tekno Tribe.

ANYWAY,
We were asked to build a web site for Travel Partners.  In exchange for
building the site we get to go to Belize (in May) as part of Team Travel for
free.

At the Travel Partners site people can enter to win a trip to Belize (in May)
with Team Travel.  This is for real, they're not selling anything (the prizes,
including the trip were donated by the sponsors)  We need more people to enter!
 So I'm asking for people to PLEASE enter and to please tell as many people as
possible to enter. I'd really love to go to Belize with a fellow raver!!!

I apologize for the blatant "commercial".  If you have any questions please
email me.

warmly
-anne

     Hi everyone, I throught I'd crawl out of the shadows for a easy request
(is there a difference between lurking and just not having anything to say?).
 Do any of you know where I could find some nice hard and fast house/trance
midi files?  If you could send 'em straight here, or suggest www/ftp sites
that they could be found I'd be much obliged.  Thanks in advance...

Hi Joshua-
	Well, I dunno...I haven't been to Toronto since I was ten and my 
parents made me watch "the changing of the guard", but I hear that 
Toronto is the Jungle capitol of North America.   I'd try to check out 
some of those Jungly beats.

have a good trip

dave.

Does anyone know what, if any, Freaky Chakra song has the sample "I live 
in a world of dreams" (which I heard during his live set at Chrysalis)?
I have Lowdown Motivator, but that sample is nowhere to be found.

Actually, now that I listen to Lowdown Motivator some more, I realize 
that the sample *is* there, on track 3, but it's not repeated over and 
over the way Freaky did during his live show.  hmmmmmmm...

I had forgotten to ask about this earlier.
Noticed how really *REALLY* good parties have had more and more people 
attending them? (Chrysalis and F&F are the first to come to mind.)
While at Chrysalis I asked somone if he thought maybe it was because more 
and more people want to attend a genuinely good party and want to support 
what the scene is all about. "Yes, that has to be it!" said he. "So maybe 
this is like a raver revolution - 
we are finally getting what we want!" I exclaimed in happiness. 
Later that morning I asked another really close friend the same 
question.  He said no - it was more like people coming because it is the 
next cool party to go to.  It kinda burst my bubble.  Now I ask you the 
same question:  Why *ARE* there more and more people coming out to these 
low profile, not-highly-promoted, really down to earth, no sugar and 
cream raves?  I would especially like to hear from those who are involved 
in these parties to speak up.  Is it a phase or a revolution - or neither?

love,
Amy

My take on Amy's question is:  It is my current theory that more and more
people are getting serious about the music.  I think a lot of people (myself
included), when they first get involved in this scene, are entranced by the
new experiences, the new music, the drugs, the people, etc...  Many don't
really have time to seriously look at the music, or for that matter, the
quality of the party.  As people go more often, however, they start to
become aware of the quality (or no quality) of an event, which imho, is
rooted in the music.  At a certain point, people are more interested in
basic parties that are really good, rather than flashy parties that are only
so-so.  

Like i said, this is just my current opinion, which may explain why more and
more people are going to low-brow, high quality events.  Renae

I caught a little of the new jungle party at Bahia last night - it
seems to be starting pretty strong, so check it out in the weeks to 
come.  Then I stopped by Roots/Black Diamond for their action - a 
decent crowd too.  

This weekend, the Groove Trip and Rain Dance parties seem to have the
biggest lineups; I'm not sure where they're supposed to be though.  I
don't know exactly what the Mixman thang is, but this weekend's party has
been scaled down from the original plan.

If anyone really wants to thank me for the calendar, you can send me
some Tom Waits tickets ;)...

to start the weekend off right and clear away some of the icicky vibes that 
have been wandering through sfraves, i thought a short passage from 
b.hoff's the tao of pooh would do us all some good.

"Let's  consider Emptiness in general for a moment.  What is it about a 
Taoist landscape painting that seems so refreshing to so many different 
kinds of people?  The Emptiness, the space that's not filled in.  What is 
it about fresh snow, clean air, pure water?  Or good music?  As Claude 
Debussy expressed it, "Music is the space between the notes"

"Wooh Baby!  Oooaowee BABY!  (Wanga wanga wanga.)  Baby, don't leave me!  
(Wanga wanga crash bang!)  Baby, don't LEAVE me!" (Click.)  Like silence 
after noise, or cool, clear water on a hot, stuffy day, EEmptiness cleans 
out the messy mind and charges up the batteries of spiritual energy."

hope to see some of you sfravers at the pacific party tonight or the sc 
party tomorrow.

peace*Jamie

Well, I sure feel like an ass.

Sorry Brian D., and everyone else for the bitter post. Not only was I in a
pissy mood, but for some reason I assumed I was the only Jonas on the list.
What's up with that?

That's what I get for not waiting a day before replying. Again, my
apologies. Lesson learned.

So hiya, Jonas Hanning (aka DJ ESkimo). Hope to meet you sometime soon.

later...

Jonas

Don't really know,  but I think it's because the DJ's are more willing to
put forth a little more variaty in music.   For instance, John Carol's set
at Crysilis was incredible.....For me,  smaller partys have top notch vibe,
better variaty of DJ's and not the SAME OLD mainstream DJ's all the time.
Also,  more Acid Trance....   Yay!!

 i personally go because i know there will be great people and a good

i think its a little of both...some go because they want to bring more 
energy to the small party, others go just because they hear its going to be 
really good..........
just my humble thoughts

>>  Why *ARE* there more and more people coming out to these 
>>low profile, not-highly-promoted, really down to earth, no sugar and 
>>cream raves?
>
 Here are my thoughts: :
>        After discovering and attending a few raves, I quickly found myself
at less attended, no frills, more intamate parties, mostly due to the
friendlier vibe and the better intentions of the partygoers. By better
intentions I mean the people were not so concerned about image ( how
you/they look, how well they/you look on the dance floor as instead of how
much fun they/you are having ). I found the clubs to be too much of a meat
market atmosphere, too much of a fashion show & the 2 massives I attended
were dissapointing. The group of friends I partied with also enjoyed the
intimate atmosphere at smaller parties, where we could actually find one
another. We would always end up seeing the same folks and actually
developing relationships, It felt like a family. So I think the higer
attendance at smaller  parties can be attributed to the fact that ravers do
grow up, and I think  grow out of the main stream raves to attend less
glamourous events that cater to the vibe and the people not the allmighty
dollar.                            
>     
>         I also think that we can thank the people that promote and produce
these smaller events for they do it with vary little thought to how much $
they are going to make and alot of thought and energy in just throwing a
good party. Sunset is a good example. They throw a FANTASTIC free party, for
wich they only ask a donation for, and do it every week all summer. Now that
is dedication, and good intentions. My hat goes off to the Pacific Crew and
all the hole in the wall promoters for what they do for our scene.

Is anyone goign to Groove Trip's from the Davis area that would like to 
have a car guest (or two or three?).  I might be getting a ride with 
DJ Jeyson (spining at 4), but he thinks he'll be going around 11 and I 
wanted to go earlier...  So if you are going and you have some room, why 
not give me a call? 754BELL
Peace and happy vibes!

birthday, and i want to go to a place with lots of friendly people 
(actually, that's always my priority for raves, but doubly so tonite.  
i'm leaning toward raindance or groove trip, but i'm still soliciting 
suggestions.

feel free to call or e-mail.  call the cellular number if the home 
number doesn't answer.

peace, love, and thanks-

I hope this isn't too far off-topic, though I've only been a lurker 
previously, I'm kinda a gypsy a heart, though I definetly relate to the rave
culture, while I'm gay I try not to be sexist...well don't mean to over 
doit in self promotion just guess I'll let this post be my introduction.

I recently purchased a 27' - '79 Dodge Swinger, "Georgie Boy" Executive style
in very good condition/low miles, and I'm looking for some fun things to 
do.  Short trips (Russian River, Santa Cruz, California Coast, Redwoods) as
well as longer trips like Palm Springs, Yosemite, Mardi Gras,Grand Canyon,
Baja,etc.  

I'm looking for young guys (college-age) that like to party, get wild, play
and have a good time, clothing-optional on all my trips as appropriate.  
With the 5000w generator we could do a mini-rave out in the desert!
If you or someone you know could snag a little sound that would be real cool.

Anyway, this is a not-for-profit adventure I'm proposing and I'm basically
looking to cover expenses (gas, site hookups as desired, food, etc.) so
if you have a little time off and this sounds like something that might
interest you than please drop me a line in private E-Mail and let's talk.

peace

Daniel

I've been following the music and the scene for quite a while also. Back
in my Manchester days where the dance/club culture flourished, the
hippie/tribal element was still in its infancy. There are many, many
people who thrive on this culture and while attitudes are as variant as
the people themselves there is often common treads the link our culture
globally. While most would say "the music", I think that the music has
changed and progressed, which is a  wonderful thing. I believe our
common link is our "open mind" attitude. This has allowed the scene to
grow, to bring people together. When we stop progressing, our minds will
close, and our culture will die. But this has happened before and new
cultures built from echoes of past cultures will emerge to start the
whole thing rolling again. I hope...

Be happy... JOB.

It was only 11:30 when I arrived and the line was huge - seemed like 
over 100 people waiting to get in.  Sean from Groove Trip told us all 
that they were already full to capacity and could not let anyone else 
inside.  I was at the end of the line, so I decided I didn't want to wait 
for who knows how long - so I came home.  Such a great party and only 20 
minutes away from my home - what a change *that* is!  I just feel bad for 
the others in that line who had come from farther away.  

But I am happy that Sacramento is putting on some good parties.  It's 
about time.  But as I write this, GT is only just beginning; so I hope 
for Sacramento's sake and for GT's sake that the party goes off!  Those 
on the list who made it in, please let us know how it was.

I'm gwan ta bed.

love,
Amy

And we were just about in, too.  Oh well, next time I guess.  Right as we 
were leaving, DJ Jeyson was arriving (this was about 1something) and the 
cops were politely telling everyone to go elsewhere ("GET WALKIN!") so it 
was an interesting experience.  I hope that those who were inside had a 
really goo time, though!

	When I speak of not wanting the authorities to think they're 
"winning" the War On Drugs (I think I used that term in a private email 
to Eric in response to a private message he sent me on this subject) it 
is not because my pride is such that I am unwilling to be a "loser" in 
this war.  I am less concerned with being "right" than with seeing the 
right results.
	The reason I don't want them to think they're "winning" is that 
this will allow them to justify the continuing persecution of non-violent 
drug users, and ensure that the violence surrounding the illegal drug 
trade continues well into the future.  
	The main force driving the growing public demand for an end to 
prohibition is not a sense that the Drug War is wrong, but a sense that the 
Drug War is *not working*.  Believe me, the Drug Warriors are eager for any 
successes they can point to at this point to justify the ongoing expenditure 
of vast amounts of yours and my money to pay for their crusade.  Personally 
I can't see any possible good arising from the continuation of this crusade.

Well, I was very confused, and a bit ticked off about the mixman thing
last night. 

I wanted to see Freaky Chakra and Bassbin Twins, so I went to the DNA
lounge. I paid $10 and walked into what looked like an office party
with Moria Carey playing. I should have left at that point, but I
proceeded to survey the premisis looking for signs of life. In the
back room , the VIP room, I found bunches of people with mixman
tee-shirts. It turns out the whole thing was some software package
release party, or just some demo of this mixman software. Bassbin
Twins were sitting around. They said they were supposed to spin, but
there were no turntables. I heard Doum (sp?, Mr Chakra) was there, but
clearly he was not going to be able to setup. I split around 1am
feeling like I do after a bad day at the shopping mall.

I knew that this mixman software thing was going to be there, but I
thought it would be on the side, and there would be real DJs and
Mr. Freaky. I can see why the United Systems event was canceled. This
looks like some marketing ass-holes clever idea for media attention.

There were even two TV stars there; Frazier and one of the acters from
Saturday Night Live. Very Weird!?!

The software was very un-interesting. It's a $40 PC package that has
two turntables on the screen ( very dumb ). It has 11 built-in sounds,
and you can play each from a different key "like you're a real DJ"
through your PC soundcard. There was no sound system, to speak of, in
the room.

I feel sorry for Bassbin twins and Freaky Chakra. I'm sure they were
equally confused. I can only hope that the mixman people didn't expect
them to "mix" on their cheesy little software game. That's my guess,
and if its correct, they should be banished to working the record
department at K-MART!

I met some others there like me who where confused and a bit
pissed. Some nice lads from Canada were very happy to find someone
else (me) who thought the scene was all wrong. One of the lads wanted
to interview Mr Chakra. I gave them my sfraves calender printout, and
went home.

I guess I was fooled by the mention of United Systems, or maybe I just
left too early. I suggest that if the "postponed" thing with United
Systems and mixman ever happens ( which I doubt ), that it be avoided
like the plague.

Hi everyone!

I'll probably be at MAD with my friend Paul tommorrow; haven't met any of
you (except Tom and Matt L.) yet, so come up and say hi! I'll be wearing my
big bloo stormtrooper shirt.

p.s. If there's anyone from the Berkeley area who might be able to fit two
in their car on they way home (in return for a share of the gasoline
expenditures of course), please speak up! BART stops running at midnite and
I'm not looking forward to sleeping at Carls Jr. :(

How are you?  I've been wondering some of the same things about these 
parties and have been thowing them for close to a year with my two 
partners David and John.  We believe firmly, that these events hold a 
spiritual value that can penetrate anyone if correct symbolisim, 
attitude,  music, and care are sincerely given.  So yes I believe that 
there is somewhat of a revolution going on from groups of party 
throwers that really take this seriously and are not motivated by big 
money.  We know that it takes money to make it happen but we also know 
that if you put back in continuiously with a level head it will grow in 

a positive direction.  These may just be the parties to go to for now 
however we are trying very hard to protect and at the same time feed 
the quality of these events.  It's a difficult balance to maintain, I 
believe it requires a family-like structure and honesty with the party 
throwers and goers.  A little trust can go a long way.  We want to see 
just how far.  What you believe and say creates a reality for others, 
so if you feel there is some sort of revolution going on - there 
probably is.  You with others that sense this are also giving and 
creating it, if others haven't figured it out do not doubt yourself but 

help them figure out and create it.  All is one.  Hope this message 
finds and leaves you in good spirits.   -Claire Korich

is it bad for you ?  i know it has nothing to do with raving, and probably
most of you have a negative opinion about it, but i just did it, and was 
wondering if i was doing my body a misfavor.  a roomy of mine had some, 
and after the superbowl, and drinking all day, he pulled out a rock and 
we all did it.  

it didnt really do much for me.  a little rush, but i dont feel a 
complusion to do more, and i thought it was supposed to be addictive as 
all hell.  

i think its a lame drug, and cant really understand how you can become a 
crack addict.  maybe that is all media hype.  maybe it is just my 
reaction to a particular drug.  

hope everyone had a great weekend !  i sure did !

bye all !

hugs to all !

i remember i posted some stuff about the celestine prophesy earlier, and 
amy and some others responded (i think immersive arts) right before an 
FnF, i think the halloween one. this seems to be a reoccuring theme on 
our minds, as it pops up from time to time. but we always wonder wether 
were idealists wanting a revolution and thus seeing one, or wether there 
really is something deeply profound happening with our consciousness and 
all of humanity. (this is about where ecto joins in on the conversation:) 
i think that if we choose to see it, then our own desire influences what 
we see, but then if this is true, that doesnt mean were just idealists. 
because even if we see something that isnt there and believe it is, then 
*we will still act accordingly* to our belief it is there. and this 
*action* is what sets it in motion. each one of us has a little power to 
influence our environment according to our perception of it. so now 
picture us gathering together in love and harmony, each creating with our 
own energy and perception of change and love, gaining momentum, because 
others want to see what were about. 
and they too see it, because were influencing their perception thru the 
vibe were creating, and their perception in turn does the same thing.
its like the gaia theories. or morphogenic feild resonance. what it comes 
down to is we all have that power, that inner light,and when we come 
toghether to share it something beautiful *does* occur. and in keeping an 
open mind, we accept others into our "family of light" (copyright:)
and grow. evolve. change.
so maybe it wasnt there to begin with, but just the fact that were 
thinking it *now* is *setting it in motion.* 

so dream out loud, friends!
	evolution of energy:) tom

BY YOUR COMMAND;

        Some people will tell you that it will rob you of your mind & soul.
Some, like me say, gee this was really anticlimatic, and never did it again.
Crack cocaine in general is a very addictive substance for most people,
especially if you develop a taste for it. I had to do that with cocaine,
before I waisted a lot of time & money on it. My advice to you is stay stay
from it, & football for that matter, they will both rot your brain; &
epecially if you like the Cowboys.

The DNA Lounge is majority-owned by Rob Schneider of SNL fame. His brother
John manages the club.

Daum (Freaky Chakra) was not there to preform live, rather to be a DJ. At
first it was unclear from the Mixman info-line and flyers that this was the
case.

I was also told that the DNA wanted to use their house DJ(s) for the
opening set(s) and then sometime later Daum and other 'real' DJs would then
spin. I was going to go check it out, but instead I came home and went to
sleep.

reply to myself, is that allowed :)

i've gotten a bunch of personal flames on posting this, that is was 
inapropriate, had nothing to do with raves, that the authorities monitor 
this list, etc.

so, apologies to all.

Liquid Groove was excellent! The vibe and energy was 
tremendous. It's too bad that they didn't have a bigger 
warehouse to get everyone in. They ended up sending many 
people home about 1am. The break-beats were so good, as I 
danced all night long. Non-stop! 

Oscure and Jesse on four turntables went off! Jon Howard was 
excellent as well. I have not seen a party like this in Sac 
ever! This is by far the biggest and best party here. I hope 
we can continue this vibe. 

Hope everyone else had fun as well. :)

peace,

Thank you thank you so much to everyone for the kind thoughts during 
my surgery and recovery. The support from you all was wonderful and 
truly helped lessen my anxiety.

The update: The doc says that I'm recovering speedily, more quickly 
than expected! I can see out of my right eye, I can read large type, 
and it aches quite a bit. The pupil is still HUGE, it's red and kinda 
swollen, lizard-like with the cut lashes, and everything looks like 
an over-exposed photo. Eventually my vision should be back to it's 
"normal" 20/40, I should be able to read fine print within two 
months, and the pain will gradually diminish. Of course, the lashes 
*will* grow back so I won't be a lizard-eye forever.


Thanks again to everyone for your kind and healing thoughts, your 
support and love. I don't think I can say anything to thank you all 
enough, but thank you!

Big hugs,  +++++
Alissa

I heard a song this weekend called "Born Slippy" by Underworld and it was
totally cool.  I couldn't stop dancing to it.  It's been a long time since a
song affected me so, so my question is, I am thinking of going and finding
the CD this song is on, but I would like someone's oppinion on the CD if they
have it.  So, anyone who has the Underworld album with "Born Slippy" on it
could you please tell me about?

Hello everyone. I know this is not rave related, but I'm posting this because
it's important and I can use some help.  A good friend of mine has 
recently been on a drug called crank, and he seems to be addicted. I know 
that he hasn't slept in 4 days, and he's been taking it the whole time, 
even to school and at work. He just had a bad breakup with his 
girlfriend, and is feeling very low about himself. Needless to say, I am 
very concerned, and I don't know anything about this drug. If anyone has 
information on this drug or any advice, please post..  

Thank you for your time - CM

I absolutely believe in that, Tom.
When directly relating it to these great parties that more and more 
people are attending, I can see 2 things happening:

1: The realization you talked about above - lots of people gathering 
together for love and hoarmony, etc. with partythrowers like Claire and 
co. keeping the greed for the almighty dollar nil.

2: Then I see these parties getting bigger and bigger (still staying 
"true" though) and those who are convinced that massives simply are not 
good parties to go to because of the reputation that massives have. Then 
we will go full circle again with the smaller no name renegades - just 
when we have the momentum going!  Can you imagine the energy a rave can 
have if it has the vibes of a Friends and Family but the size of the 
Gathering?!?!??  Who needs substances!

In any event, I am looking foward to how F&F, Gateway, Pacific, 
Frequency-8 and others change and grow this year. 

love love LOVE,

-----------------------------0---o-------------
We are very, very sorry that we could not accomodate all the good people that
showed up Saturday night.  We lost our original space and had to use a
smaller warehouse.  By 11PM we had nearly 1,000 people, already over max
capacity.  Aside from the fact that we needed to assure everybody a
reasonable amount of oxygen in there, we also had the firefolks and the popo
threatening to shut us down all night.  But we can promise that we'll do our
best make room for all of us in the future.  
Thanks-    Sean, Jason, Erin

P.S.  A really big thanks to all those who packed the energy in as tight as
the bodies, making it known that we're growin, in & outside of Sacramento.

Hope to meet some people too, but I regretably don't have a laminate yet..
seem to have missed all the parties that Wayne the laminate guy said he'd
be at... Will there be anyone at MAD or at Vision (the next party I'm going
to) who''l be able to provide a laminate... They're free, right?

So I guess all I can say is that I'll be wearing a stormtrooper shirt
unlike any other because I made it myself... that's MY distinguishing
feature. :)

Hi everyone,

I think the title of my message says it all. Did anyone go to Rain Dance on
Saturday Night? I wanted to attend but couldn't make it. What did I miss
out on?

Keep on smiling,

Actually, Doug, I think it's entirely appropriate.  SFRaves is a bunch of
different things to different people.  If the authorities monitor this list
then it's in your judgement wether or not to post.  If the suggestion is
that it's "off-topic", then how 'bout half the other posts here such as
"I've had a bad day and I need some energy" or "I'm looking for an ISP."
These aren't strictly rave-related, but then again, one doesn't need to be
on SFRaves long to see that it discusses many topics which may not be, in
the strict sense, rave-related.  In light of this, I think that your
question is welcome here; I'm sure you're not the only one of the hundreds
of readers here who would like to know the answer to your question.

Jake

Hello all,
I agree with Jake, just because his question wasn't about E or acid doesn't
mean that it isn't relevant. Doug, you should check out the hyperreal drug
archives for info.

Heya all,

	I went to RainDance this weekend, and had a good time. This was 
the first time I've seen the Acme warehouse open on all three levels.  It 
was a good thing, otherwise the whole place would have been way too 
crowded (a common problem at Acme).  Frankly, I'm getting a bit tired of 
the Acme warehouse and in particular of that evil, narrow staircase at 
the entrance... There simply isn't enough room for people to maneuver in 
that place, and the stairwell is too steep/narrow/dangerous to accomodate 
400+ people trying to get out in an emergency.  I have 
scary thoughts about what might happen in the event of a fire... <shudder>
	But, enough of that.  The party was really enjoyable, although 
not quite worth $15.  The crowd was different from my 'usual' 
gang.  There seemed to be many more youngsters (highschoolers) than I am 
used to.  Nonetheless, the vibe was pretty strong and everyone boogied 
hard.  I didn't see a single laminate, although I did see the 
indefatigable Cap'n Crunch boucing around.
	I spent most of the night on the ground floor, 
where Tracy spun a wicked set (as usual), and then some other guy I don't 
know came in between her and Garth.
	There was jungle spinning on the second floor, and some trancier 
house in the basement, although I can't be sure 'cuz I didn't spend much 
time in either of those locales.  The second floor turned into a big 
chill room early on, so the DJs responded in kind with mellower music.  
Some DJ I've never seen before, named Pollywog, was spinning there around 
3am.  She/he (sorry, I couldn't really tell...) had *really* cool hair and 
plastic gremlin ears (?!) and was spinning some gruvy shit.
	I left at 3:30am (early Sunday meeting), but overall had a swell 
time.  It was nice to hear some thumping deep house after a long sojourn 
of acid and trance.  (although I still prefer the latter!)
	I went home and slept through my meeting.  Feh.

		take care all,

			jon--Oven broiled, not deep fried like the others!

	you for got to add "to me" at the end.  well, you sort of do later.
	anyway.  i am a trap drummer of 15 years, and a "rave" musician
	(chill music and dance) and a dj.  dj's communicate with the crowd.
	when i spin, i don;t just play my records.  i agonize over the
	choices, "feel" when the crossfade should occur.  i get off on
	watching people in the crowd get off, watching them feel where
	the are and let me take somewhere.  i watch them intently.  i am
	most definately communicating meaning.  i want them to feel
	something specific with my craft.

	not to mention my live music.  human-controlled filter sweeping
	can send people into fucking outer space.  i have seen it, i have
	been the human on the one knob.  i have clicked a mouse between
	sequences with one hand, controlled a single filter with another
	while surrounded by people going completely apeshit wacko with
	dancing euphoria - a few joining in on didgeridoo or bongos.
	it's not always the medium.  many mediums can convey the message.
	it's like saying that you can only get the truest meaning of
	something if it is spoken in chinese, when in fact it is just
	another way of saying somthing.

	a drum machine obviously cannot play drums like a drummer. and
	people on teevee are not in the same room with you as you watch it.
	this is kind of a non-issue with me.  the music is different, a
	live drummer is not needed to pund out relentless, perfectly
	repeated beats to help induce trance states.  we are not trying
	to sound like drummers, we are trying to beat fucking fractional
	math into dancers heads to send them out farther, to distract
	their conciousness so they can finally forget about it and fly
	around outside their body for a while.  if you don't get off
	this way, hey, that's fine.  some people get off on jesus and
	feel the same effects.  whatever it takes.

	in the end, it is about what gets you off.  just be aware that
	there really are people composing this music, and the dj's and
	live artists are just as into setting up hardcore feedback loops
	between themselves and their audiences.  i mean, things have to
	be happening like that when you see a room with 200 people
	erupt into simultaneous screams when the music is *on* and the
	dj does a killer crossfade.  this happens.  i have seen it.
	in fact, someone not paying attention, walking in the room, might
	not notice it as much as when you feel it, because part of that
	screaming is a rush of energy that the group of focused individuals
	create around themselves.  i have seen this not just at raves...
	actually the most intense time i experienced this was at a hemp
	festival put on by the holy hemp sisters in santa cruz - my friend
	was hit by the rush so hard that it knocked him over.  without
	question, this happened at dead shows.  sufis, native american
	sundancers, jesus' yoga tricks on the cross, 3 hours of masturbation.
	whatever man.  it's about getting off.

	again, i assert that dj's and live techno artists have the
	same powers.  i have seen it.  granted, you are talking about
	the best experiences you have had, and have been fortunate to
	find your best experiences in the dead, who were quite adroit.
	i mean, you will find more "rave" parties that suck than dead
	shows.

	i have seen the same exact behaviors at good parties that i have
	seen at dead shows.  even spinners.  eben the same jokes, man!
	"why do deadheads/ravers dance like this? (wave hands in the
	air)  --  to keep the music out of their eyes!"

> THAT's why people flip for the dead,

	a dj is a musican.  you have not seen the right dj's, or
	watched them.  watch andre lucero spin a set, up close.
	someone like him who practices 4 hours a day would probably
	be rather offended at the narrowmindedness at which their
	art is being viewed in this sentence.  no offense, dan, just
	be careful.  people have *plenty* of mean, nasty shit to
	say about the dead, some of it sounds like this.  i could
	harp on the fact that bobby *never* sang harmonies on pitch.
	but you know what?  people *liked* it anyway.  so who cares.
	the feedback loops do not require acoustic, two-drummer rock
	bands to make them happen.  listen to qaawal (sp?) music -
	nurat fateh ali kahn.  listen to most *anything* that is done
	from the heart.  because it doesn't get you off does not mean
	that it is bogus.

	dj's, good ones, are artists of human soulful musical communication.
	different hardware, different software, same wetware.  ik.  sorry
	i got a little too /mondo2k/ on y'all there.  what you are talking
	about here is taste, nothing more.  and the misconception that
	drum machines are supposed to 'replace' drummers.

> Think about shamanism - where do they get to, how do they reach into the
> people in the room?

	not with the greatful dead, or guitars, or amplifiers, or bill
	graham, or turntables, or analog synthesizers.  they have their
	own way, just like you and i do.

> -dan

	that reminds me, we gotta jam sometime soon!  bring over your
	gear again!

I was really looking forward to Rain Dance since I hadn't heard Jeno and Garth
spin for a while -- but didn't get what I expected -- 

The main floor was SOOOO crowded, it was out of the question after about 1am
(but Tracy's set when I got there was right on) -- so I spent most of my time
upstairs and had the amazing experience of listing to Polywog, (yes a woman and
an awesome one) spin the most outrageous crazy mix of "don't ever think you can
predict what I'll spin next" stuff -- she played Close Encounters, which totally
put me over the top, since that's my metaphor for what raving is about.
Remember in Close Encounters, the people who were drawn to that mountain didn't
know why, didn't know what it was, and didn't know what they'd find there -- but
they had to be there, and be there together -- That's what raving is to me --
anyone who is drawn to be there belongs there -- and having her play that
awesome sequence where the mother ship not only communicates with us earthlings,
but takes off with that riff -- that was really awesome.  Then she'll happily
mix in off-beat rap, Rolling Stones, gospel, weird minimal tones -- anyway, if
you've never heard her spin, look for her and you'll hear something really
unique.

The energy there was really great and friendly, and I want to thank everyone I
met and saw there for their great spirit -- and thank everyone who appreciated
my white feather hat -- 

See you at Wicked!  Leslie : )

Is there anyone in Sacramento looking for a crate or two of practice vinyl.
 I've really got to liquidate the vinyl archives, and box #7 is up for
extermination.  I do stress that MOST of it, if not all of it sucks really,
really big twinkie.  But you never know, I was at Nicky & Steves (bolinas)
house party this weekend and Steve threw down some crazy shit that I remember
tossing in that box without flinching, some early 90's baby doll house, but
hey it sounded pretty good when Steve played it.  Hmmm, : }.  Most of it is
88-93 House & Rap, and a lot of records with funny looking girls with big
hair and too much jewelry on the covers.  Anyway first one to hunt me down
gets it, all I ask is the gift of one good new record with somthin happy
funky on it.
Steveo
P.S. it's not worth driving up from s.f., and definitely not worth me listing
what exactly is in it.

P.S.S. I'm also taking bids on my Barry Manilow Colection.

this morning, leslie, the wonderful prophetes of raving spoke-

>put me over the top, since that's my metaphor for what raving is about.
>Remember in Close Encounters, the people who were drawn to that mountain didn't
>know why, didn't know what it was, and didn't know what they'd find there

WOW!  i really like that explanation, and have had a similar experience, of
being drawn to a rave- it was too far away, too expensive, i was tired, but
I NEEDED TO GO ANYWAY AND I HAD NO CONTROL OVER THAT!

thanks for the inspiring words, leslie-

peace, love, and close encouners-

Doug,

crack is evil, stay away. I had a friend who got seriously addicted to it,
to the point of smoking it all the time, spending $500+ a week on it, lying
to all his friends and girlfriend, and finally attempting to kill himself.
He could not stop on his own, and was doing it behind a lot of people's
backs, when he'd said he had stopped.

It may not be addicting the first time, but I guarantee if you do it a few
more times (taking its seriously addictive properties lightly), you WILL
become a crackead. Your statements about how you don't really understand
how it could be so addictive exactly echo my friend's response the first
time he did it. It was this "I don't get it" response that caused him to
seriously underestimate the power of this substance. By the time he
realized what had happened, he was a hopeless addict. He is still battling
the addiction - he claims that he craves it daily - even though he hasn't
done it in over 6 months.

I don't mean to sound like a hard-line "drugs are bad" fanatic - but I've
seen firsthand the damage that crack can do. You don't want to go down this
road. I would STRONGLY urge you not to do it again, and to try to get your
friends to stop as well.

yes, i agree, STAY AWAY FROM IT.  crack (and crank) IMO are drugs that 
bring you to a lower level of consciousness and all you become aware of 
is that you are at a different level but you may not realize how low it 
is.  i also have had friends who succumbed to this and one of the saddest 
things i've ever seen was a friend of mine who was pregnant and addicted, 
lied, cheated and stole from those who cared about her and she just 
didn't even know that things were fucked up.

for the good news, you don't need it.  you are a beautiful and perfect 
spiritual being just the way you are! there are so many enlightning 
experiences ahead of you keep your mind pointed in the direction of 
higher consciousness like you already are by being on this list.  you 
will learn alot from the wonderful people here as i have and share your 
wisdom, too.  thanks for posting!

bright blessings,

Ahhh the joys of raving,
Two weeks ago I took a newbie friend to sythetic, they liked it, a lot.  Last
week she went to two parties by herself, and enjoyed them, a lot.  I was
speaking with her last night, and she made references to how sensitive she
was to the energies she encountered there, specifically the negative ones.  I
consider her wise, and she understands the reality of the different people
being there for different reasons.  After much consideration, I decided to go
into the "old school" speech, in a constructive manor, and not full bore of
course.  I was explaining rememberances of how earilier, almost every party
goer in any given venue was there for one common reason, defined
individually, yet the same in principal.  I explained the theory of Rick &
others of "creating the vibe" not finding it.  And reinforced the idea that
that central purpose is still very much alive, just a bit dispersed amongst
the crowds.  She shared with me how she felt that finding the right people
was neccessary for the creation to occur, I had to agree, and went off for a
while about the more underground events & the joys of being surrounded by a
single harmonizing energy.  We both brought up the issue of
elitism/seperatism as claimed by some, and after a while determined it was a
crock of shit.  Simply put, the strength and truth lies underground, and
there's really nothing wrong with that.

I've only been on sfraves for about a month, and love it.  I'm looking
forward t catching wind of the type of event I am speaking of, so I can
immerse my newbie sister and myself in the pure, undilluted energy, and give
her a really clear picture of exactly what it is we're working toward here!
 She thinks she's excited now?! 

Love & Life,
Steveo

Dang, that's a lot of people I should have said HI to...

Well, I really haven't met anyone from this list yet, except for the people
I already know anyway :(

I looked around for laminates, but I saw none and didn't recognize anyone.
Will go next week, and hopefully will meet some of you then...

I posted a short description of myself monday morning, but I guess no one
remembered/recognized me so I didn't get to put any faces to the names I
see everyday on this list. Next week I'll try to be a little more... uh...
distinct?

no real chance of doing it again, it was on of those things where you are 
in a situation where it is handed to you, you've been hanging out all day,
drinking, in a good mood, good vibe, so you trust and try it cause it is 
there.  the whole experience just made me curious as to how someone could
become addicted to it, but you kind of answered that.  first time, mild,
second time, it digs in deeper.  i guess maybe like any drug.  it always 
starts off seeming so controllable and benign and no big deal.  then, as 
you continue in, cause you think you are in control, bango, it subtely 
gets a hold on you.  

thanks for your post, it made me realize how it is with any drug.  and 
how careful you have to be.  i hope your friend gets over its hold it has 
on him.  each day should get easier, and staring it down should make him 
stronger.  

addiction.  hmmm.  what a topic.  how it subletly starts, how it grabs 
hold.  pick any drug.  its always the same.

just have to say, that i agree, totally, that you walk into an event, and you
are hit with an initial vibe, of the entirety of how the event is going 
off.  you take it all in, and sometimes it is negative.  but, if you hang 
with it, get back into yourself and close your eyes, that negative for me 
always crosses to positive, you pick it up, it picks you up, and you are 
there.  

but its funny how mostly for me, events start off negative, and then turn 
positive.  dont let that initial reaction scare you off !  it always 
turns positive if you turn in, then turn out.  of course, the music has a 
lot to do with it too !

smiles !

hope everyone is well !

actually, drugs can be split into two categories. Addictive and 
non-addictive. the addictive ones, such as crack, crank, heroin, alcohol, 
... can make you phisically dependant on the substance. however, some 
drugs dont cause any addiction whatsoever, such as psylocybin, LSD, 
marijuana, MDMA,...   unless ya count psychological addiction, but that 
has more to do with the person, 
your body wont go thru withdrawls if you stop taking the latter mentioned 
substances.

Having never tried crack, I was wondering exactly what it does to/for 
you? Is it just plainly phyisical where giving into the craving is the 
users reward?, kinda like cigerettes? If it is so bad why do so many 
people take it? why? why? why!

Happy Wenesday everybody... JOB.

Right on to that.  As for some other rave alternatives, I'll mention that I
danced myself to a frenzy at Gwar not too long ago (a frenzy being about
the only way you *can* dance to Gwar) and just about lost my mind to Sonic
Youth last summer.  But leaving all this, and indeed *everything*,
behind--beyond rave, rock, rap, the Dead, Burning Man, sex, drugs,
bungee-jumping naked from collapsing bridges, or whatever other paltry
thrills you may turn to for your occasional tot of ecstasy, that little
electric taste of The Edge--there is CRASH WORSHIP.  You want to talk about
temporary autonomous zones?  A Crash Worship show is, without exception or
reservation, the farthest remove from everyday reality, from normality,
from life itself as we know it, I've ever found.  A Crash Worship show is
not a place, not an event--it's an entity, a single seething fusion of
audience and performers that can grow to be invested with an awesome, even
terrifying, elemental force.  I've felt myself dissolved, become a single
swarming cell within the greater being, catalyzed by the power and
intensity of the performance.  Really, there are no words.  It's just WAY
OUT.

Hey there-

	When i was home (Boston, MA), for the holidays, I was going 
through a pile of newspapers that had been set aside for me, when I came 
across an intriguing article in the Boston Glone of September 4, 1995.  
It was entitled _For this disorder, music is a hallmark_. It goes on to 
describe a group of youngsters who go to a music camp in the Berkshires 
(mountains in Western MA), who have Williams Disorder, a "rare 
developmental disorder that results in an unusually complex distribution 
of abilities and disbalities."  The thing is that these people are 
considered learning disbaled, mildly retarded (I hate that word), and 
have limited motor control. But they also have this incredible 
response to music and incredible social interactions amongst themselves.
	One of the stories in the article is about the group talent 
show.   A seventeen year old boy plays his own composition on the piano, 
while the others look on.  All are "completely absorbed in the music, 
rocking to and fro."  When he finishes, the group "bursts into applause, 
the cheering becoming a spontaneous collective performance.  Everybody's 
having a great time.  One boy gets up, does a little jig, and turns to 
high five his (smiling) neighbor."  
	The "disorder" is caused by a deletion on chromosome 7, so 
researchers are intrigued by thinking about genes for musicality and 
sociality.   One researcher said "It's as though these kids have a sort 
of instant compassion, a biological empathy." 
	
	The parallels with E are obvious, I think.  Most of you have 
experienced the incredible connection with music and with other people 
when on E, and you know what I mean.   So, I'm wondering if some of the 
same things are happening to these people with Williams Disorder.  Does 
the partial deletion of chromosome 7 affect the same chemical balances 
in the body that ecstacy does?   

	Does anyone know anything more about williams syndrome, or does 
anyone have any thoughts about this?  

				Ponderous, -dave.

Anarch just made a post about what they are like, and it is not the first 
time I've heard of Crash Worship being mentioned on sfraves.  I am really 
curious about them now and would love to attend one of their shows.  Does 
anyone know how often they tour and when the next tour is expected?
How about a web page? Do they have one?
Growing curiouser and curiouser......

love,
Amy

Which is really too damn bad, because festivals involving fire, masquerade,
and ecstatic dancing are a longstanding human tradition.  It's sick that we
look on this as something alien, usually to be shunned.

Too far out for most places, unfortunately.  Last I heard they were in 
Brazil or some such, having run out of places to play in the US.  A friend
read an interview with them where they said they basically demanded half
their guarantee in advance knowing it was all they'd ever get...

Seriously, Anarch is right on.  If you really want to get in touch with 
the Beast, jump on in and let the sound dissolve your superego.  The demons
of your preconscious mind aren't nearly as evil as you've been led to 
believe.  Generally a few minutes of hard sweaty bump-and-grind with your
partially clothed neighbor will chase away any violent impulses you 
may have had.  Although given the nature of disease transmittal these 
days, you may have to restrain yourself from getting down and doing the
nasty with a stranger right there on the floor.  Seriously, it can 
be that sensual -- one particular CW show at the Square counts as the only
time I've ever deep-kissed someone I didn't already know very well.  And for 
those of you that know me, yes, that is _way_ out of character, but 
certainly not unpleasant for anyone involved >%^)

I guess one reason that those events make such a big impression on me
is that raves seem almost asexual in contrast.  I don't advocate a
meat-market atmosphere; I don't think I've ever "hit on" anyone in my
life.  I guess it's that despite being intensely physical, people seem
more into being wacky than sensual.  And before JSLee gets on me, yes,
I think many bodies look much better fully clothed, but I can
certainly appreciate the sight of healthy and fit humans gettin' down.
Sure, sometimes you're off in trance-land, your eyes are closed and
you're orbiting Jupiter and you're not interested in thinking about
your physical body, but sometimes it's kind of creepy seeing almost
everyone in the room off on their own world and not really seeing
what's around them.

For me, fast trance gets me the out-of-body experience, whereas the
more hiphop/breakbeat/two-and-four gets me down into my body.

Hello all,
Crash Worship is one of the best live experiences around. They haven't
played in the Bay area for a few months, so they should be around soon. If
I hear about a date, I'll post, 'cause I think everyone would dig them
alot. Very tribal, very ecstatic experience.
Love
Tim

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the first reasons I ever got involved with raves was precisely the
"anti-meatmarket" atmosphere.  I finally had found a place where my
personal space didn't get intruded on.  I could truly enjoy myself without
limitations.  I bonded with my friends and was able to explore feelings
and thoughts in a scene without seeing myself and others in a perpetual
mating game.  Raves really helped me see people outside of a sexual
perception.  However, I wouldn't say that raves are asexual.  They have a
lot of sexuality mixed up in them in different ways.  I find it to be very
positive and not in the least scary.  In fact, raves (along with many
other factors) caused me and some other friends to question our sexuality. 
This has enlightened my mind and is a part of me that I thoroughly
embrace.

Subject: Pacific Party and Spundae Review
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Last Friday, I finally went out after an absence of dancing for a few 
weeks.  Got a chance to check out Pacific's party in an Oakland warehouse.  
I got there around 12-12:30 am and got a chance to meet some new sfravers.  
Thanks Wayne for introducing them to me.  (Hi, Rikki, Shawna and two other 
friendly people whose names I've already spaced out on! :}  

The stripped down warehouse was divided in half by black plastic and some 
cloth backdrops for visuals.  One side had the projector and porta potties, 
the other had the dance area, chill space, and concessions.  Both sides had 
tall ceilings and each space was retangular.

It took a while for the crowd to warm up and the vibe to build.  There were 
alot of people standing around the "perimeter" of the dance area trying to 
get into the mood.  Initially the music was just too trippy for me but 
after socializing a bit, I finally got in the mood and moved towards the 
dance floor.  It didn't seem like things picked up (for me at least) until 
John Howard took the decks.  He was starting to work the crowd as more 
people got motivated to dance.  

Around that time, a friend told me that the police were here and the music 
was turned down some.  I wasn't really paying attention but someone said 
there were two security guards standing in front of the decks and 
periodically spoke to the dj...perhaps there were noise complaints.  So 
around 4:30am, my friends and I decided to bail out rather than see this 
thing through and spin some records chillin' at their house.  Anyone stay 
beyond this time and can tell me what happened?  I haven't seen any reviews 
on this yet?  It mustn't of been good 'cause alot of people were just 
getting into things when we left.

Saturday and Sunday rolled into a blur w/the weather, a relaxing hot tub & 
sauna, walks, talks, and much surrealism as we flowed in synch w/our 
energies.  By the evening of Sunday, we were ready to finally get out and 
dance since we didn't really do so on Friday so Spundae was the choice.  On 
a roll, four of us walked in to an already groovin' crowd.  Both the 
Teknotika (sp?) room and the "house" room had the synergies going off.  It 
was nice to walk into it and contribute our vibe.  Saw lots of old friends 
who I haven't bumped into for a while and though I haven't been to 
Spundae's in a while, I felt there was a good number of people in 
attendance as well as a diverse mix.  (Perhaps by Sunday, most of the egos 
are dropped and we're more accessible?  Got into lots of great 
conversations re: spirituality in raving.)  I felt quite comfortable and 
danced/chilled all night.

All in all, it was a great weekend for me.  I hope the rest of you had a 
good time and again, I'm curious to hear what happened at Pacific's party.

See you around!
Diane

I would like to thank everyone for their help.  I am just overwhelmed 
with the responses I received, and so touched that I cannot find the 
words to express my gratitude. It's nice to know that I am in the company 
of many warm and caring people, and to see this new electronic medium 
used in such a positive way to help others.  I am happy to report that my 
friend is seeking help with a counselor in trying to deal with his addiction.
He made an appointment even before I got a chance to suggest it, which 
indicates to me that he realizes the magnitude of his problem.  Once again
, thank you all.

James

Yes!  A while back, I mentioned to the group that when I go off, I open up 
and work through my chakras while dancing.  At Spundae, I ran into a newbie 
to the area and he expressed the same thing independently (w/o me 
mentioning my theories about raves, house music, etc.).  We spoke about how 
the driving bass and funky groove lines get people to move their hips, 
shake their booties and open up their lower chakras.  For me, I believe 
that this helps us get into our bodies enabling us to get beyond it to a 
trance state so we're able to work through to our heart chakras and 
ultimately to our crowns.  Basically I like to initially dance to house and 
3-4 hours later, get into a trance OBE state only to later land back by 
falling into an ambient groove.

I'd be curious to hear other people's versions of what makes them go off 
and where it takes them.  Do others of you feel that you need to get into 
your body before going off?  And lastly, what music does what to you.

Luv,
Diane

But I think government has helped a great deal... There is no perfect
government, so you can't compare the US government with all the smiley
people at your average rave. But you can compare the current state of our
government to societies where government is weaker or even nonexistent...
those societies function perfectly when everyone knows everyone else and
people can keep each other in check based on societal expectations and
norms, but when you're dealing with society on a larger scale, for example
the city of San Jose (not to mention something as monstrous as the entire
USA!) then there's no way people can keep each other in check and you're
going to have all kinds of bad elements creeping out and pretty soon the
people will develop some kind of government / law enforcement out of pure
necessity.


>hovever, on a smaller scale, i have never seen security, or any laws and
>rules, at FnF. hmmm.

Thing is, FnF is a "self-chosen" community... i.e. the people who go there
are all intent on just having a fun happy time and there aren't any
problems. However, when you try to apply this to a larger scale, like a
nation for example, you have to take into account criminals and poverty and
arrogance and greed and everything, and the only way to duplicate the
"self-chosen" community (like FnF's) would be to choose your citizens based
on what you want in your country. There are two prominent historical
examples of this:

Nazi Germany, where they decided to get rid of undesired elements of society.

The Red Scare of the 50's where a few self-righteous senators and
congressmen decided to intimidate and deport members of society whom they
believed did not share their view of how a proper America should function.

I would really love that, that would just tickle me pink, but I don't think
it's possible given the number of "bad apples" we have in our current
society... This world is just too overcrowded and it's causing all kinds of
problems and there's not much that can be done... the only country thus far
that has tried to deal with overcrowding is China, and they have taken the
authoritarian approach by limiting the number of babies a couple can have
to one!!

There's just so much to worry about in this world, it really makes me sad.
I'd like to see everyone live together peacefully, but I know deep down
that it'll never happen, so the best I (we) can do is to apply that kind of
joy to our immediate suroundings and being happy.

This conversation is really great... I love talking about this kind of
stuff... I think I'm going to post this to sfraves because I'm curious what
others on the list think about this topic.

Huh?

I gotta tell you, when I dance, I'm not OB, I don't feel any chakras (or any 
other terms not part of the general public's vocabulary).  On the other 
hand, I enjoy the hell out of dancing.  I'm a bit of a show-off, so there's 
that, but with the right music -- usually something with tons of really 
heavy, driving, ancient, tribal bass -- there's a feeling of power, of 
energy coursing through me.  In my mind, it's as though the other elements 
of the music are simply counterpoints to that booming; and then it's like 
something ancient, something that speaks to something eternal within.  I 
feel the blood of ancestors long dead come to life within me, and we are 
one, dancing infinite, moving to that beat, the puissant thrum beyond 
hearing of the earth's timeless magma heart...

Whoa...was I getting deep?...Sorry...  58-)

At the Martin Luther King Jr. Spundae, I could have danced all night to some 
of the things that got spun, and it was because of that energy.  But OBE?  
No, can't say that I have.  I don't suppose this requires or is aided by 
chemical assistance?

I would have to agree completely with KC.  As a guy, I really hated going to 
clubs, wanting to dance, only to sit around wishing I didn't have to ask a 
girl to dance with me.  Face it, in a "mainstream" club, a guy dancing by 
himself really stands out.  You have to play the game or sit in the corner 
with your beer.  I don't mind meeting people, but sometimes I just wanted to 
dance (really!), and  some of the women weren't real polite when they shot 
me down.  It sucked greatly.

With raves, I can dance 'til both butt cheeks fall clean off.  I can be 
myself.  The physical contact, ie. hugs, backrubs, handrubs, etc.,  that 
often occurs in chill rooms isn't sexual -- it's not asexual either 8-)  -- 
it's just *really* nice.  People are infinitely more approachable!

I went back to a mainstream club recently for a friend's birthday.  The 
whole time he was trying to talk me into asking someone to dance, knowing 
that in the past I always gauged how good a time I had by how much I got to 
dance.  I just smiled and told him I wasn't in the mood, then I'd turn the 
conversation to something else.  He's not into raves, and he just doesn't 
understand that I no longer see the need to stress myself out in the "old" 
scene when I can do all the dancing I want in the "new" scene.

Peas,

I totally agree that this is great; I can actually go and _talk_ to
people without this undercurrent of tension like "Does she think I'm 
hitting on her?" or "Is she hitting on me?" or whatever.  And since I 
like to talk, this is a big bonus.  I guess I'm verbally promiscuous >%^)

To me, it seems like the tough question is "Is it possible to be sensual 
without being obnoxious?"  Seems like the problem happens when people go
in looking for someone to take home and boink, pardon my directness, as 
opposed to just being part of the experience THEN AND THERE.  The first
is sensuality as advertisement: the second is for its own sake.  Sort of
the difference between walking around all day in one of those ripped muscle
T-shirts, and deciding that maybe the big floppy ski hat and long-sleeved 
sweatshirt are sub-optimal when it's 102+ degrees and the walls are 
dripping.  Coat checks are a _good_ thing.

I guess it's a comparative thing for me.  Given the really blatant energy
at events like Burning Man and Crash Worship, it's hard to find anything
that comes close.  I think the closest was at one of the Komotion F&Fs,
where someone had brought that huge roll of fluorescent string, and everyone
was winding it around the roof, the couches, themselves, throwing clumps of
it at each other, snaring their friends...when I mean "sensual" I mean 
"something that involves the senses", including the much-neglected touch 
and taste.  Sexual energy is only a part of sensuality.  Trancing out is 
great, but for me it seems to be the opposite, a journey deep into the 
bizarreness of my own mind.

Every time I see this discussion go by, a similar point is made.  It's
never that _I_ would ever do anything bad, you see, it's all those
_other_ people...

Who are all these "other" people that we're so scared of?  And how come
none of us is one?  Just who are we demonizing here?  I mean, if it's
not me, and not you, and not anyone I know personally, and ... well, 
who's left?  Who's the big bad wolf?

Are we really scared of what's within our own selves?  Or are we just 
scared of change?  Given that the human race is currently facing 
ecological collapse and consequent worldwide famine through overpopulation 
and stupidity, I like the thought of exploring alternatives.

Call me wacky...

	Didn't we just have a thread about why we need bouncers at raves?

	Personally, I think we need our own island.  This also just came up...  
of course, you can't get away from the *really* bad boys (the ones with the 
nukes, who hire governments to cover for them).

There is a web page, as someone noted, but at present there's no info there
about shows or tours.  That page has only been around a short while, and
the "upcoming performances" section has never been filled in at all.  They
used to play around the bay pretty frequently, every 3-4 months or so, but
the last local show I know of was this past May.  That was part of a tour
that finished midsummer, so hopefully they'll be back playing soon.  They
can be tough to keep track of...their shows go on with varying degrees of
underground-ness, so the level of advertising, promotion, etc can vary a
lot as well.  Assuming the web page gets updated regularly, it should be a
good source of info--it's run by their publisher, Charnel Music.  Asking on
rec.music.industrial can also get answers.

Well, I'm one.  For starters, If I knew that law-and-order wasn't
being enforced, I wouldn't be stopping at all the red lights.
Why?  Because I trust my own judgement over a bunch of
blind rules.  But do you?

> Call me wacky...

OK.  Just don't drive that way while I'm on the road.

Hi everyone!
	It has been a while since I have posted but I am still here! I 
just got some new albums I wanted to tell you about. skylab#1 on 
astralworks is the first new one I got and it is really nice clean and 
smooth ambient sounds, I put it up there as one of my favorite ambient 
albums since Global Chillage which is my all time favorite chill sounds.
Other new tunes are goldies timeless which is also an excellent work, Im 
not much of a junglist, and expected a rougher edge than this peice has 
but it has a pretty mellow groove and is nice to listen to. Other new 
works are U-ziq (In pine Effect) and Sven Vath (Accident in paradise) 
which I havent really had time to get to know so maybe I can say more 
about these later.

Good point... I hadn't thought of that...

I guess my response would be this:

Everyone has a little bit (or a lottle bit, depending :) of "bad" in
them... anarchy and greed are natural tendencies, IMO. The degree to which
people supress their bad tendencies is what makes society run smoothly.
Everyone has the potential to be a bad apple (I know there are a lot of
laws and social conventions that I would break if given the chance), and if
there were no *real* consequences (i.e. imprisonment or other forms of
punishment imposed by a legal government) then I think a lot more people
would be coaxed or nudged into letting their anarchistic tendencies show.

Everyone's nice at a rave, but those only last a few hours and then
everyone gets tired and cranky and unpleasant.

I think I am cautious of what's deep within people (including myself)
because I believe that deep down, we're really (in the words of Kurt
Vonnegut) just apes who can read write and do a little math, and given the
chance to practice anarchy freely we'll do what the apes do: band together
in tight little groups (gangs, frats, etc. :) and fuck each other up over
food and territory. Contrary to what many people think, I believe that to
be charitable (like at a rave for example) is to supress one's selfish
instincts and to perform the hardest thing imaginable which is to let go of
aggression and greed and to spread a little love...

Actually, you just pushed one of my buttons, by referring to anarchy as
something intrinsically evil and bad, just like the 10 o'clock news or
any random newspaper always do.

What is anarchy, anyway?  A situation in which there is no government, 
i.e. no organization that coerces behavior by threat of force.  (This,
btw, is all a government is and all it can do.  Whether coercing some 
people is _good_ is the argument, not whether that is what a government
does.)

That's not really saying much, is it?  The real question is: what would
YOU do if there were no government?  You have more freedom, and with it
more responsibility.  No traffic tickets, but no traffic laws either.
Nono of your money is confiscated ("income tax"), but you get no 
government services either.  Your parties are never busted (!) but you
can't call the police if things get out of hand.  You can dig up the 
street and plant flowers, but your neighbors can physically restrain you
from doing so.  You can smoke all the dope you want, and it's cheap, 
but...hmm.  No downside there.  Chevron can pollute the bay all it
wants, and eco-guerrillas can blow up their offices.  The going gets
weird, and the weird turn pro.

As opposed to what we're doing now, which is band together in BIG groups and
fuck each other up over food and territory?

Ask any native North or South American, or Ainu, or Irian Jayan, or
Tainos (all dead -- oh, well), or Tibetans, or any other tribal people
about how well big governments treat you.  Or for government
vs. government, W.W. I and II, Korean War, Vietnam, Gulf War, Nazi
Germany, or Mexico (natives in the Yucatan), or Cambodians, or
Serbians, or the entire Middle East, ... the list goes on.  These are
_governments_ killing people.  "Civilized" nations, dig?  And there
are hundreds more wars going on right now, I'm just working off the
top of my head.

I'll take the danger from tight little groups over the danger of big
scary groups any day.

We might feel safe because we happen to live in a stable time in
American history, but check out our natural resources (rapidly
depleting), national debt (rapidly increasing), and population (still
growing).  Our government is about the _least_ scummy of those in
existence, and it's rapidly heading towards fascism (drug seizure
laws, anti-"porn" laws, etc.)

I don't think of it as being unselfish at all.  If I know that I will
be seeing people over and over, it is in my best interests to treat
them with love and respect unless and until they mess with me.  If I
am known as an open and honest person, I will be treated better than
if I am known as a liar or other undesirable.  The only reason
dishonesty works is because in a huge population you can keep moving
and not have to always face the people you've lied to.  I don't like
having to constantly worry about keeping my lies consistent, and all
the other worry that goes with maintaining fronts.  That takes my time
and energy.  Therefore, I choose the occasional problem of dealing
with someone who has messed with me over the constant problem of
maintaining my front.

So I'm nice for selfish reasons.  Sorry if that ruins it for anyone,
but I like to think that it's more genuine that way, since I'm basing
my attitude on sound judgement rather than faith in some religion or
principles.  Faith comes and goes, but reason will always be there for
you if you need it.

Someone tackle me!  I'm being way too talkative today.

i think that the degree to which people surpress their dark side is what 
causes hatred, greed, fear...

and perhaps when were free to really be ourselves, without worrying about 
convention, who do i need to impress, how should i be acting,... 
and acting on intuition, then we may 
find positive ways to release our tendencies, like dancing our asses of, 
being creative, (maybe something about crash worship has something to do 
with it). but really letting go, and being free!
this society says that pure indulgement is sinful, or evil. and many may 
be forced to surpress such tendencies, not finding outlets for their 
anger or love, and all that what we try to surpress, this "dark side" 
will eventually manifest itself, positively or negatively.
perhaps were not ready yet to be so, but the day is coming. humanity wont 
put up with this stagnant rat race weve created for ourselves. we *must* 
evolve, it is our nature. if it wasnt, we wouldnt be here in virtual 
space discussing this. 
and maybe raving is 
this positive outlet, to indulge for a night, to feel free to let go.
i know how beautiful and carefree i feel after dancing all nite, or 
spinning a great set, or "whatever gets [me] off."

i find raving is everything but supression. its about leting go, going 
off, being myself, and the spreading love thing kinda comes naturally
when im at that state of consciousness (really in touch with myself - not 
neccesarily substance induced, either). when im surpressing my "dark

mike, has anyone ever considered your art "dark"?

I think you forgot that it isn't anyone who looks like us either.

The thing with it is, that where a definition for "bad apple" is applied,
there forms a separation from those segments of society that are thought to
be making things worse (the "us vs. them" mentality). As things get
progressively worse, more people are needed for the "them" category to
rationalize the "downward" trend, eventually swallowing everyone, while the
"us"'s intensify their identity (e.g. go "hardcore") as an equilibrium
maintaining reaction (see Newton's 2nd). This is a suicidal mindset whose
logical conclusion involves antisocial alienation and identity crisis, as
the idea that the self no longer belongs to the "good" side creeps into the
picture.

I am reminded of a quote:

"Few blame themselves until they have exhausted all other possibilities." 
-Anonymous

While the reasoning of this quote is weak where it seems to encourage low
self-esteem and the impracticality of pursuing _all_ possibilities, it
illustrates the concept that anyone can be responsible for the states of the
world and society. Whether and how you deal with this possibility is, of
course, up to you.

Thinking about it, I have to agree.  When I go to a really good rave, 
and I find myself on the dance floor dancing my ass off, or really 
connecting with a beautiful person, I realize while i'm in the middle 
of doing it that something is missing, and of course that something is 
all the stuff I've been taught all my life by society etc.  Worrying 
about what other people think, nameless fears, unhappiness with myself 
resulting from other people telling me what I should be, 
self-consciousness, angry bitter thoughts, & all that artificial junk 
that we just weren't born with, but was instilled in us as the years 
pass.  And I actually feel emptier when this happens, cause I just let 
it all go, and I feel a lot lighter!  So I think letting go is exactly 
what happens.  Leaves a lot more vacant space for the 
music/love/contentment/peace to fill!  And it makes just a little bit 
more of a better person after the fact, just a little closer to who I 
ultimately want to be.

Hello 

I thought Pacific was pretty good, I really liked the space a lot.  To me
there was not many people though.  I liked the music but it wasn't that loud
most of the time.  I started dancing early and it seemed as more and more
young people showed up, I started noticing quite a few girls (with their
friends) just standing smack in the middle of the dance area, pretty much
oblivious to the music, having little chats, with bursts of laughs
occasionally.  That was kind of weird.  It was kind of an awkward feeling.
 At some points it was total dancing energy and at other times it turned into
a lot of people standing in the middle chatting.  I think that it probably
had to do with the music becoming more and more like background music.  That
is when I noticed myself taking lots of breaks sitting on the floor and then
had zero energy and left at about 3:30-4..ish.  
Saturday night, Acme wharehouse has a very good reputation for having a good
space.  I think the Pacific party had a better space.  I prefer one big space
with a few good DJ's then, a few broken up spaces that are not to big and
very crowded.  I was there to hear Garth and others on the 1st floor, but
because that was packed all the way to the door, I was forced to chill on the
2nd floor for most of the night listening to Pollywog, whom I thought was
good to chill out to, but I really wanted to get down to Jeno and Garth on
the 1st floor.  When I tried going down there a couple of times, I always
ended next to some muscle guy in a wife beater tank (no offense).  Which I
felt like if I wasn't watching the guys every move I was going to get a fat
elbow, smack in my face.  So back upstairs I went.  I left approx the same
time as the night before for basicly loosing my energy, chillin for too long.
 I am happy I have met one Sfraver so far, Leslie. I need to meet more of
you.  It doesn't seem to be that to many people are into wearing their
laminates, so maybe someone should think of something else.  Any suggestions?
 I think some people think laminates are corny and that is why you don't see
them out much.

Apparently no one here knows why the Full Moons stopped being thrown at
Candlestick Park (as they were every month of yore): violence from the party
goers, e.g. some who showed up decided to kick some ass. Another time, a
ranger got shot.
