Subject: [sfraves] Tantra

I was worried about it - but it was awesome.  I realized something last
night - some parties are about the music, some are about the people.  While
the music was AWESOME, this one was about the love.

It was sort of biorhythmic for me.  I always see some friends at whatever
party/club I hit.  Sort of rhytmically, though never in sync.  Last night
was a massive convergence of the upswing of almost everyone I ever
hang with.  A massive high point with everyone cresting together at the same
time and place.  Almost all my best friends, the boys and girls I have the
luck to call my friends, the people I love, were there last night (with a
very few exceptions).  Like I said, the music was great, but I spent the
vast majority of the night just sitting and talking with whatever friend
happened to walk by.  And there were plenty of those.

I'm not sure the rest of the year can follow through on the precedent set
last night, but I'm sure going to try.

Thanks to everyone for a great start to the new year.  I'm a lucky guy.

Tim

their names, whether they be actual western spellings
or purely phonetic sounds for everything that they
have done for me in my life or for simply just

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Shared Room Available

Hi SFR
I have room available in my apartment for anyone that would be interested. 
The rent of $350/month is all the expenses you would need to pay, with the 
exception of Long Distance. That 350 will get you rent, electricity, water, 
DirecTV satellite service, high-speed broadband cable internet access, and 
unlimited Local phone calls. Your room comes with a huge walk-in closet 
that's bigger than some college dorm rooms, more than plenty for 2 people. 
The common areas are completely furnished-couch, dining table, entertainment 
center, and coffee table. I am looking for a respectable, clean male (no 
drugs or alcohol within the apartment) to share the room and apartment with 
myself, my 19 year-old brother, and my two adorable cats. We are very 
respectful of one's privacy and are very easy to get along with. It is a 
month to month lease with NO DEPOSIT! The complex is located in a very nice 
and safe area, right across the street from Del Mar high school. I am hoping 
for a mid-January move-in but I am flexible on that. If interested, you may 
contact me at 408-294-3908 or email me at rtahir22@hotmail.com

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Best Piercing / tattoo places in Berkeley or SF

Heya
I know that this has been a thread before but i can't find it in my old emails, so, my
apologies... but, since things may possibly have changed anyway since the last thread:

Where's the best place to get a body piercing [nipple], and the best place to get a
tattoo [not sure where or what yet] in either Berkeley or San Francisco?
I live about 2 blocks from the Amoeba on Telegraph, so Berkeley might be preferable,
but SF would be easy to get to if they're decidedly better.

oh yes - verrrrry nice...  cheers to everyone who made it happen.  i love
it when everyone i've ever met at a party reassembles in the same place
and bit by bit throughout the night i run into them.  nice atmosphere,
nice people, good music...  but damn, they kept they high energy tracks
going almost until dawn - those djs have no mercy!

Subject: [sfraves] Forget number games, how was your new years?

Not sure about the rest of you, but I'm more interested in how everyone's
new years adventures turned out.

Planet New Year, Tantra, Otherworld, XTort, The Backbeat and a flurry of
other parties, yet no details? ("oh-my-f%cking-god" is not details) Did
they all kick your ass or something?

Myself, I was booked out of town for some unknown party in Sonora. Great
music, great venue, great setup, small crowd....but damn did the
belligerent drunks come out in force and attempt to trash the place.
Thank God for Sonora's finest.

Anyway, my nye adventures were pretty uneventful, what about the rest of
you? We want stories!

As you read this you must say to your self why? Ask your self the question 
"why when you read this"

here is a website that i think most of you people will like or even get a 
kick out of it. <A HREF="http://www.shmater.com/lifestylechangesfortherichandfamous16.html">
http://www.shmater.com/lifestylechangesfortherichandfamous16.html</A>

Well, anyway on to this. 


Why is it that most of the "Rich & Famous " get to have evething they want 
and also if they screw up in life they can bail them self out with just 
pocket money *MILLOINS OF $$*  Why is it that people in are life favor the 
rich "Rich & Famous " more? i am not caping or making fun of them. but the 
life style of having money and the life styles we all live from them is 
totally different  no one can say it better than the band "GOOD CHARLOTTE - 
Rich & Famous*


Take a good look at this site. <A HREF="http://www.shmater.com/lifestylechangesfortherichandfamous16.html">

Subject: [sfraves] Planet New Year - story in SFChronicle

Hello SFR community,

I was just contacted by a staff writer for the SF Chronicle doing a
story on Planet New Year.

He's looking to talk to anyone that was there, that might have information
or perspective to help balance out the story. Surprisingly (or not), there
were a couple OD's + possibly other tragic events, he has info from
police, coroners, and companies, but wants to talk to the rave community
to get their feedback.

If you're so inclined here's his contact info:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Planet New Year - story in SFChronicle

Im sorry but i do not agree with anyone that contacts the news to talk about
what went on. The news is notorious for taking an interview and cuting
things to get the story they want. We are having enough problems keeping the
scene alive. All this is going to do is make it harder and harder to bring
it back.

Please think about the consiquences of your actions befor you make them.

So you'd rather get the distorted exaggerations and half-truths of just the
authorities and corporate entities?  :)   No way, dude, at least we should
get our exaggerations and lies-by-omission in to the Man, too!

If we take that stance, then look forward to a cover story tomorow with
your boilerplate "raves are bad, people died" content.

I spoke to this guy on the phone for a while, and while I am no expert in
in gauging media-type, it sounded to me he had plenty of damning info
already, and was looking for perspectives from our camp.

So, if you have an intelligent, coherent contribution I would encourage
you to call this guy.

or you can see the one that's already on their website, headline: "FATAL NEW 
YEAR'S RAVE."  with the note that drugs "probably" were involved in two 
deaths and seven hospitalizations.  even if "pro-rave" comments get twisted, 
could the result be *worse* than that?

who has no comment on PNY, since i stayed home NYE.

Right, it's much better to let the media make their *own* inferences as
to what happened... Or better yet, allow them to reach conclusions based
solely on the (presumed) experiences of law enforcement officials and/or
anti-drug proponents, who are more than willing to be interviewed When
Things Go Wrong at Raves.

> We are having enough problems keeping the scene alive. All this is

Give me a friggin' break. What's keeping the "scene" from "coming back"
is the collective idiocy of giddy teens, greedy promoters, puritanistic
"rave experts" and anti-drug proponents alike. Honest ravers remaining
tight-lipped about the goings-on of underground events only helps to
fuel media speculation, resulting in the public's ever-distorting
perception of raves as drug-fueled sex orgies, or whatever.

Now, I could see why you wouldn't agree with a bunch of pre-teen candy
kids being interviewed after their first rave. But I would hope you
agree that there are enough intelligent, insightful people in the
community willing to participate in an interview, if nothing else but
for the sake of defending the already long-tarnished image of our
community as the public sees it. The enemies of EDM seek to discredit us
by pointing to OD's and arrests as proof that we're all evil people. Why
would you neglect an opportunity to prove them otherwise?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Planet New Year - story in SFChronicle

I do agree that there are plenty of ravers out there that are intelligent to
make a positive impression on things but I highly doubt that those are the
people that they are trying to contact or even wanting to use. I love the
scene and would love to have people on the news or even do "live interviews"
so they can not be cut to voice the lighter side of the scene but due to the
circumstances at have I don't believe that's what they are looking for.

Since the subject is up, I've actually been wondering about this for quite a
while (at least as long as I've known about the domain squatters at that other
site)

Why DOESN'T Brian slap those SOBs down and take the name back???

I don't know ALL the details, and I know it take some time (Dancesafe's
recovery of Dancesafe.com STILL isn't final (It still redirects to those eztest
wankers...)) But there IS a process for taking your domain back from these sort
of people.  And domain name squatters are barely an evolutionary step above
spammers, after all.

Is it just not Brian's style or something?

I'm fairly certain that most registrars won't spend too much time dealing
with domain squatting cases unless you can prove bad faith AND show
evidence that the name is yours, i.e. legally trademarked.

Besides, sharing names is sort-of the /point/ of having separate TLD's for
commercial, non-profit, military, educational, governmental or network
uses. Seems like sfraves.com is being pretty clearly used for commercial
purposes. ;)

Compare and contrast: gnu.net, gnu.org, and gnu.com.


>Is it just not Brian's style or something?

It is my understanding that Brian was the original owner of McDonalds.com,
and attempted to give it to the company but was turned down until they
figured out what the web was. Could be a small-scale urban legend, though.

Also, for us to "slap down" VORG would entail the use of the same legal
rationale that allowed etoys.com to slap down etoy.com, and I'm pretty
sure that allowing party merchandise to be sold online is ultimately the
greater good. (or lesser evil, depending on whether you like the shirts)

And the answer to the Dancesafe.com dispute is..


*drum roll*

Litigation.

Domain dispute, already in progress.

Barring any unforseen circumstances, we hopefully should have it back within
the month.

PS: If Brian needs some info on how to go about it.. let him know to contact
us/me, we might have some insights for him.

Subject: [sfraves] Tantra: The art of love 

--=====================_5971354==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Some define "tantra" as the spiritual art of love, connecting spirit with 
body.  The party Tantra at the SomArts Gallery on NYE was just that for me 
and many others this NYE.

A year ago the SFLNC attempted to throw this benefit party at SomArts but 
they couldn't obtain the permits.  This year Jimmy Wood and others worked 
on behalf of SomArts and had its entertainment permit re-instated, and 
these same lovely people along with the aid of many community members threw 
this awesome party.

For me, that evening was a reaffirmation of my faith in our community and 
its future.  I have been avoiding clubs and large parties lately, 
preferring to reconnect with the intimate family vibe I have been avidly 
seeking this past year.  We have made a strong effort to reestablish this 
vibe at the Moksha parties:  old school some call it.  Intentionally 
crafted events with a spiritual connection that seek to attract respectful 
and loving dancers.

Tantra was not a small, underground event.  I'd guess they had well over a 
thousand peeps in there.  And it was permitted.  I was pleasantly surprised 
to see the first all ages party going past 2 AM in San Francisco in quite 
some time.  It is quite difficult to manage an intimate, caring vibe at a 
large party but these people succeeded big time.

For those of you who have never been to SomArts, this venue is a dream come 
true:  spacious warehouse with multiple dance areas and outside space for 
the smokers.  Tantra productions used every inch of this vast space 
beautifully.  The genre-defined dance areas included the Psytrance Temple, 
devoted to goa trance;  the Bass Chamber with jungle, breaks and the 
like;  the Underworld serving up driving house, techno and breaks; and a 
very proper chill room.  I was delighted to see they brought all these 
genres and there adherents together in one loving place.  We have danced 
apart for too long, and it is time for the tribes to unite IMHO.

Vibe was definitely old school.  Visually, the underlying theme of tantra 
and related spirituality was carried through in each dance area with some 
truly magnificent altars as well as banners and other visual art.  There 
was even live oil projection in the psytrance room.  This art originated in 
the sixties, and involves the use of colored oils on glass projected with 
an overhead.  Still very effective.  The overall production here was very 
high value, with much attention paid to details.  Vibe, though, is not 
merely a function of the decorative arts, though it is supported by 
them.  Vibe arises from, I believe, a "contract" between the producer and 
the guests --  and this, by necessity, involves "promotion,"  that is, the 
delivery of a focused message that attracts dancers who are loving and 
respectful, delivered by people who have a reputation for creating safe, 
happy spaces for guests who are treated like family.  I never saw the 
small, four-color flier until the night of the party:  it had a dancing 
Shiva on the front.  The only notification I received was one email from 
John Wood and some info through SFLNC.  That was enough to assure me that 
Tantra was the place I would be on NYE.  I would have preferred a party 
with a bit more house, but I was aiming for vibe and I got what I expected 
from the promoters:  a thousand person event with love in such abundance 
that I'm still high on it all.

I talked with John Wood as he was leaving around 3 AM:  poor guy had to 
work the next morning.  Told him that his event was more evidence in my 
mind that this community is far from moribund, as some of the jaded 
believe.  Tantra had much of the positive, joyful, soul-connecting energy 
that rave parties had back in the early nineties.  With the same diversity, 
acceptance, respect, personal creativity and peace that I grew to 
passionately love in our tribe.

Further, the people who came to Tantra danced.  All night long.  So 
energizing, a party with dancers.  I confess my feet hurt severely at the 
end of the night, but my heart had touched so many others on those dance 
floors and our collective spirits were liberated from the self-centered 
darkness to freedom in the light.  That's what it's all about.

And yes, the amenities were those one expects at family parties.  Water for 
a dollar donation to SFLNC.  Chai teas (I liked the peach flavor).  Free 
fruit -- nothing like an orange at four in the morning when you've been 
sweating on the dance floor.  And plenty of toilets:)  Security:  no 
Draconian check at the door, and nearly invisible inside.

Deaths: 0.  People sent to the hospital: 0.  Folks lying about on the 
floor:  a mere handful.

I spent most of the evening dancing in the dark, "underworld" room where 
the house and techno resided.  But I sampled all of it and, since I am also 
a psytrance fan, spent the rest of my dance time with those in that light, 
energy-filled space.

Lots of old friends at this party.  I was really surprised to see Android5 
there -- he returned to SF from Detroit to be at this party.  Before he 
left town there it was a rare party where we didn't dance together.  So 
good having him at this party.

Tantra exemplifies the very best this community has to offer.  As for the 
other shit that went down in this town that night, let me restate what I 
have said before:  Coolworld has nothing to do with the rave community.  A 
couple of years ago a spokesperson for Coolworld issued a press release 
condemning raves as events that were destroying the dance 
community.  Coolworld events were not raves but music and dance 
festivals.  Fine.  I was satisfied with that then, and let's make sure that 
this distinction is made now.  Our community was never "mass market."  We 
were always about respect for ourselves and others, and providing familial 
love and care at our events which, for the most part, were and are given 
for the love of the music and dance and as vehicles to raise monies for 
good causes including protecting the rights of dancers.

I'm grateful to the Tantra crew for bringing me into the new year with such 
an awesome family party.  Let's have many more of them this new year.  Our 
community is strong and loving and we can and will withstand the oppression 
and commercialization.

A happy new year of music and dance to all of you, sfravers.

Much love,

Apollo

Aside from the WEEPs, would someone care to explain how 
this is not a perfect descriptor of house or techno, in 
addition to trance?

This is already turning into another trance-bashing 
session... for my own education, I'd like to hear the 
house and techno adherents explain how their respective 
genres exceed trance in variety and creativity.

Don't interpret this request as snarky.  I'm genuinely 
curious.

Subject: [sfraves] Chris/Andy/ANYONE: Why Is Trance Inferior to House/Techno/Etc.?

Yeah, I'm posting this again, under a more descriptive 
subject line, because I honestly want it answered.

I feel many of the slings and arrows that are lobbed at 
trance -- it's repetitive, devoid of creativity, it 
doesn't go anywhere -- can be easily and forcefully thrown 
right back at most other EDM genres: house, techno, 
jungle.

So much of the criticism I've seen of trance isn't 
convincing: "it's cheesy," "e-tards listen to it," "it 
SUCKS!"  Sure there's plenty of bad trance.  There's 
plenty of crap in any music genre.  I've heard plenty of 
bad house, boring techno, and interminable jungle.  But I 
can't condemn any of them because when produced and mixed 
well, they're as good for dancing or listening to as good 
trance.

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM... ;-)

> oh man - i love that one. and that other one that goes

> BOOM chick BOOM chick BOOM chick BOOM chick WEEP WEEP 
> WEEP WEEP... awwww shit!


Aside from the WEEPs, would someone care to explain how 
this is not a perfect descriptor of house or techno, in 
addition to trance?

This is already turning into another trance-bashing 
session... for my own education, I'd like to hear the 
house and techno adherents explain how their respective 
genres exceed trance in variety and creativity.

Don't interpret this request as snarky. I'm genuinely 
curious.

nope.  that up there describes house or techno just about as well as
trance.  don't get me wrong, i ain't bashing trance...  just making fun.

i hang out with a lot of musicians and whenever this conversation
starts: "oh man, trance (or house, or techno, 99% of the world can't
tell the difference you know) is so boring and repetetive - i just tune
out when i hear BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM" i have to remind them that this stuff
is what a theorist would call "functional dance music."  by the same
token, i'm sure there were plenty of 19th century viennese hipsters saying
stuff like "oh man, waltzes are so boring and repetetive.  whenever i hear
BOOM chick chick BOOM chick chick i just tune out."

personally, i like a good drum n' bass mashup or maybe a little
braindance...  but the four on the floor stylee definitely is the great
equalizer.  anyway can dance and fucking go off to such a simple
framework, and music-makers are freed up by that simplicity to do all
kinds of interesting things on top of it.

I went to the otherworld party.

The decorations were by far the best I have ever seen in there.  The main
room had a little pond and tons of greenery.  And there was a variety show
room that looked like it was straight out of a tv or movie set.  Nice
work!

The music in the main room was superior, and largely generated live.  I
think there were only 2 dj's all night.  In the other rooms there was tons
of diverse stuff, comedy, spoken word, hip hop, and some wacked out
music(s).

I played a live set in the main room which was going great until matter
accidentally pulled the power to my computer, and we had a few minutes of
silence before the pounding beats started again.

Matter and JP (plateshifter) played a live techy trancy set, which was
great despite some subtle sync issues.

Jack Clang played a solid (as always) techy set all live, then 396 and
Aneurysm played live madness with 396 scratching over it.  Insanity.

Dj Yap pounded a great hard techno Dj set.  Then there was a male/female
duo that played techy poppy stuff, with vocals...

At the very end mixmaster morris played cds.

I had a great time, always great to see the OW cru and friends.

It's not.

The problem is, we live in an area (and time) whose mass-market rave
industry marketing machine is currently focusing its energies on trance.
Therefore, a larger volume of crappier trance gets produced and played
here & now than any other genre, so it's the most salient example of low
quality that we have.

If 92.7 (party!), mars, mystre and the rest of the f-8 hangers-on were
flogging techno or house, and trance was produced in the caring hands of
producers who gave a fuck instead of appeasing the marketing behemoth,
then maybe you wouldn't hear about how trance is bad.

BTW, headline in today's chron: dance party turns tragic!

<perspective flammability=low>

Personally I feel that trance was a highly creative and evolving music
genre from 92-95 (ish).  Somewhere around there it became /popular/ and
many duplicates and cross genres started emerging, generally with a very
low creative quotient.

In the Bay area, at a certain point the "goa" style (hum and
vibrate fingers against your lips) aquired the term trance, and the
original trance that started it, lost it's identity.

Now I'm not saying that there is NO creative trance out there.  For sure
there is, there are still artists that push the limits of trance induction
and make beautiful challenging tracks.  BUT, they are rare in the overall
sea of 92.7 ocean of crap pop 'trance'

Now I do realize that the lowest common denominator is just that, the
worst possible music that people can tolerate.  Still it boggles my mind
that people can still listen to (or ignore as the case may be) pop
anything.  Blech.

</perspective>

Hmmm.  I personally don't care for MOST trance.  There
are a FEW exceptions..very few actually!  As far as
trance not going anywhere - thats not really true, and
thats half the problem...it goes too damn far (to a
point it's just friggin' silly).  As a "DJ", I like to
be able to mix freely and express myself through the
mix, rather than let the song play while holding my
hands up in a prayer like pose!  The type of tunes I
like to play are songs that almost require quick
mixing and creativity with the mixer and decks.  Most
of the big trance dj's aren't dj's...they're guys (or
girls) standing there playing records...theres a
difference!  Come watch me (or any other hard working
techno dj) play and you'll see that I'm (we're) busy
the entire time (workin that shit!).  No time for
bullshit poses or dance moves and more time for
seriously rocking those peeps with your creativity and
not someones elses...

This is very true!  I agree 100%.  But you have to
understand that most of the trance that is played here
at the parties is complete shite!  Horribly mixed and
defunkt of any thought...unfortunatly thats what most
people know as being trance around here (thanks mars,
mystre, dyloot, tom slik and the rest of the garbage
posse).  Anyway, I hope that this helped a
little...and please remember that these are MY
feelings about it...just an opinion!

tech,

chris

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Chris/Andy/ANYONE: Why Is Trance Inferior to House/Techno/Etc.?

i have to jump in here and insert my two cents.  well...it may end up being more than just two.
why does everyone have to follow everyone around like goddamn sheep and jump on the "trance sucks" bandwagon all the time? now, i haven't been too active in the scene, i must admit, but i have been raving since 96 (not that long, i know) and i've witnessed a strange phenomenon...there comes a point in most ravers' careers when they feel the need to say, "trance sucks, candie ravers suck, i'll never wear my candie again."  and other such denouncements.  in fact, i've seen people who were candy just months before actually look people in the eye and say, "i've never been a candie raver"  bull shit!  i have the pictures to prove it.  
what's that all about?  imo, that's just old fashioned elitism and snobbery entering yet again into a subculture.  and, raving as  a culture should be one of the last vestiges of society where this sort of snobbery exists.  
almost all of us were turned on by candie at first....turned on by trance even more.  why do we have to denounce those precious and beautiful aspects of the scene, just to feel or appear like a more "old school", refined and intelligent raver?  when i hear people say things like "trance sucks"  i just see them as narrow minded.  
this is not to say that they're aren't some real sucky trance songs out there...but to devalue the whole genre??   it's music people, and music is an art.  respect it.
sophia
ps....besides, i know when you "trance-haters" are all alone, you put in that mars and mystere, or whatever else....and dance.  i know you do, just as sure as you are afraid to don all your old school candy.  be yourself, and forget what everyone else says is cool, or right to believe.

I am, like, soooooo busted!  I may as well come out of the cheese closet and
show off my Paul Oakenfold ticket stubs, my 30 different MP3 remixes of that
Four Non-Blondes song, and the glowstick that I froze so I can forever
remember that night I spent jumping from side to side to that fist-pumping
DJ while I wore a vapo-rub mask. Oh shit, did my pants just get bigger???

I'll Start.

My name is Dominic Son.  I've been living in the Bay all my life.  I believe 
Dreams come true, so i got into the music industry when i was 17.  Making 
electronic pop songs at first, i went to my first homebase rave in 1997 by 
the ghost tribe crew, and said to myself, "I MUST BE HERE, THIS IS WHERE I 
SHOULD BE!" 
So I started making techno music.  I performed it live with the Asian scene 
and they ate it up.  Coolworld saw the market and they booked me for their 
New Year thing in 99. 

I love electronic music with passion.  When i say electronic, i mean ALL 
forms.  As long as there is a synthesizer, i'm all for it.  It's in my blood, 
it's the reason why i'm on this list, cause i know this is the one thing we 
all share.  

I thought by introducing everyone, we keep it real, and we get an idea of 
where all of us are coming from.  

Next?

Hi!  My name is Omid.  I'm a double-sagittarius, and I enjoy long walks on
the beach, romantic dinners, and making fun of CaNdY RaVeRz WhO TyPe LiKe
DiZ.

I, too, like just about all forms of electronic music, as long as it's done
well. Which probably means that I don't like any of my own, as I like making
music, but just don't do it well. That's why you will never hear it.  If
only more people would admit to their musical shortcomings... :)

My stage name is Omi-San, reflecting my half Japanese heritage, as well as
my innate elitism. I primarily spin house, but I always try to mix in
whatever the hell else I can, because sticking to one genre is, IMO, boring.
And I like to impose my tastes on anyone who'll listen. Willingly or not. :P
If you want your ears to hurt, check out www.radio1328.com

I was born in Iran (my other half, which makes me very popular with
government types), spent some time in London, and then spent the rest of my
time supposedly growing up in the South Bay.. until I left for Hell-A for a
while, cultivating my 'tude and intolerance for others. I've been back here
for a couple of years now but am dying to go somewhere else, as I have some
sort of life ADD or ADHD.

Been on and off SFR for just over 5 years now, but have only met maybe 4
people from it. (See "intolerance for others" above.)

Anyway, this year, I'm looking forward to not meeting more of you at my
nearly non-existent gigs, as I feel far more comfortable hiding behind my
digital soapbox ;)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] A New Year, Let's Re-Introduce Everyone On the List That Posts.


My name is Ryan (Rayn)McCormick,

I was born and raised mormon but started veering away from the LDS
religion when I was about 16 when I started thinking for myself and
noticed too many inconsistencies in organized religion.  I've spent half
my life in California (Redding, Sacramento, Novato and Redwood City) and
half in Utah (Provo, Murray, Holladay, West Valley, Taylorsville, Salt
Lake.)   As you can see I've moved a lot.  I'm on about my 18th or 19th
residence now.  I believe this has led me to be a very shy person as
I've constantly been having to be new places and meet new people.  You
may see me at parties, but most likely I won't talk to you first.. I'll
just be off in some back corner dancing.  Once the ice is broken though
my shyness disappears quickly.

When I was 17 I was looking at the Colorado Institute of Art in Denver
when my brother took me to my first rave.  He'd been trying to take me
for years but my parents wouldn't have it when he came to Salt Lake to
visit and went to Playschool parties.  I believe it was a birthday
party/rave in a skating rink for Hipp-E's mom.  Like most people's first
party, it changed my life.  I went home and as soon as I turned 18 moved
out of my house and started raving like it was the end of the world.  I
never really got into the drugs at parties because of how important they
were to me and I didn't want to be a statistic and bring down the scene.
I didn't even know about E until the year I moved out of Utah to
California.  Had never been offered a pill, didn't even know what it
looked like.

Upon moving out here and being 21, I found it easier to go to clubs than
to drive to parties far away only to find out they've been shut down.
I've slowly been getting more and more jaded over the years, but at the
same time, a lot of the small clubs have the same feelings as a good
rave.  Lately though I've been fiending for the old days so my new years
resolution is to hit clubs as little as possible and start going to what
made me fall in love with the music in the first place.  Also with my
friends we're trying to get a small recording studio/record label off
the ground but since I work so much my creativity is lacking in both
trying to set up the business aspects as well as recording music and
doing my photography.  This is all changing this year as well as I've
decided that what I love is more important than what I do for money to
keep a roof over my head.

New Years was really important to me this year in the fact that even
though I've been partying since '95, I finally got to help be a part of
setting up a party with my friend in Utah.  This two week vacation I'm
coming back off of has shown me that I still have a love for life that
is suppressed for my need to pay rent.  Expect to see me out and about
more this year, my jadedness is starting to fade.  

-Rayn

 Planet New Year 03 brings in the New Year with thousands cheering!

 

 A capacity crowd brought in the New Year at the Cow Palace with Stellar performances by Paul Van Dyk, Planet B, Christopher Lawrence, Donald Glaude, Wish FM, DJ Dan and many others.  Complete recap, video & pictures will be available soon on our web-site @ www.coolworld.com

 

 Coolworld would like to extend its condolences & blessings to the families & friends of 2 individuals who passed away on New Years Day.  One of the two men was an up & coming DJ from Rohnert Park, Ca., and the other young man was from Stockton, Ca.  They will both be missed!  

 

 Coolworld wants to thank all the people, the Cow Palace, the City of Daly City, the Daly City police department, CSS, Volume services & all the other groups, artists, & individuals that helped to make this years festival happen.  

 

PLANET NEW YEAR 2003- RECAP

 

 Coolworld would like to thank the capacity crowd who attended this years Planet New Year @ The Cow Palace, making it a huge success!  PNY03 gave refuge to all music lovers and united people from all walks of life, religions, cultures, and creeds!  Making the Planet New Year celebration one of the most diverse multi cultural events in America! We had an array of performance artists who traveled across the Planet to entertain and perform @ this years massive festival!

 

 The Coolworld Mothership arena was full by 7:15pm with music lovers from everywhere wanting to catch Superstar DJ Paul Van Dyks first California festival appearance ever.  PVD opened the show with an amazing set, and took the crowd on an incredible musical journey that left them begging for moreHis set was so intense, that he decided to thrill the crowd with a special 30 minute encore that was well accepted and we thank him for this!  Next up, Frank Nitty & Ghost from Housenation, kept the crowd moving & Wish FM changed it up with a special Drum N Bass set that was both melodic & hard.  Americas favorite DJ,  DJ Dan took the stage @ 10:15 to a capacity coliseum crowd and took the event into full gear.  

 

 Upcoming Electronic Rock group Planet B hit the stage next & the crowd erupted into a adrenalin filled frenzy as the magnetic & charismatic group rocked the crowd with there unique & original all live sound.  Planet B took the crowd into the New Year with a techno rock cover of the Beatles, Come Together& closed with a New Years Countdown & fireworks ceremony that was nothing less then amazing.  Donald Glaude kept the New Year spirit bangn with his unique style of performance & turntablism & Christopher Lawrence closed the Mothership arena with such an incredible set that left the crowd cheering the whole way out.  Other arenas, featured stellar sets by DJ Craze, who always impresses, DJ Huey, Mystre, Tom Slik, Dyloot, St. John and many others.  

 

 Coolworld would also like to thank everyone for coming together peacefully and keeping PNY03 positive & friendly atmosphere for all.  We cant thank you enough for this

 

 Again, Coolworld would like to extend its condolences to the families & friends of 2 individuals  who passed away on New Years Day. They will both be missed.

 

  Please be on the look out for Coolworlds upcoming events, as we are right around the corner from the Winter Music Conferences most anticipated event; "The Ultra Music Festival"! Last years festival gave refuge to over 30,000 music revelers! This years festival is going to be even bigger as Coolworld & D'Vox Magazine are set to attract over 40,000 faithfuls!

 

 Coming up in April, Coolworld's "Spring Gathering" music & arts festival will showcase an array of artist and producers from around the nation and will be centrally located right here in the bay Area!

 

HAPPY NEW YEAR From COOLWORLD!

excellant idea, dominic.  
alright...i'm sophia, very lurker-ish, read-every day, post-once-every few-months sfraver.  i started going to raves, what to me seems sooo long ago, that in fact....i can't even name some/most of the parties i've been too.  or, er...maybe it's all the ecstacy i've ingested.  somehow...the memory's gone.  oh well, who needs a memory?
no really, the first party i went to was tiny!  it was in that little record shop on telegraph.  it was funny, actually because the fire dept. came and the crew made most of us go upstairs into the tiny little room above the stairs while they looked around.  it felt so secret...so exciting!  
i took ecstacy for the first time that night....and later in that same small room, i lay on the floor staring up at the "sky" the crew had created on the ceiling, when...what came out of the speakers...pink floyd!?  holy shit....it was a beauitiful, rolling perfect moment.  one of very few that remain as precious memories.
i still love to go to parties....i still like to take e once in awhile.  but neither my time or money will allow me to with the frequency i once did.  hanging out here on sfraves allows me to party vicariously through all of you.  
sophia
ps.  i don't even think i've met any of u...that will need to change.

Thanx for the introduction, Omid!

By the way, his name means "hope" in Persian-Farsi :) 
Nice name!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PNY03 Aftermath & Re-cap...

Dear Coolworld,

  I would like to thank you for that letter thanking
all your attendees and that oh so brief side note of
the two men that died at your party. At least you
chose to recognize it, although it was to a meager
degree.

  You can give all the sympathies you want and the
deaths will never directly be targeted at you,
however, please be aware that in a large way they
indeed should be.

  Dancesafe,  a nonprofit, harm reduction organization
promoting health and safety within the rave community,
as we understand was NOT permitted by any means at
your party. Your Production Crew, being a popular host
of these 'massive raves' is fully aware that there are
drugs like ecstacy present. It is only fact that many
of these pills are unsafe and harmful if not DEADLY to
its user. 

  But what can we expect from a large Production crew
who is solely there for profit? Of course you will
choose to be ignorant of these facts and take that
large risk to do what is 'politically correct' and not
allow this controversial yet postive group into your
parties. And look what it cost you? THE LOSS OF TWO
LIVES, who just maybe, otherwise wouldnt have been
lost if pill testing facilities were accesible. The
fact remains that there is little you can do to stop
drug use.

  I hope you actually choose to take these recent
events and do more than pretend to care abouth them by
offering less than a few words of your, "sympathies."

  On a side note, you are a disgrace to rave culture.
You take what is something meaningful and blow it up,
leaving little left of what the real culture in
reality was. I hope that being the influential group
you are, you will choose to do something more positive
and pay back the true culture you borrowed your ideas
from. We don't stand for money-making, or bright laser
beams, we're a community built solely on four things; 
peace, love, unity, and RESPECT. Please, don't kill
it.

Thank you.
Sincerely,

Abby
somone who truly cares

Damn, and all this time I thought the song by the same name on the new
Thievery Corporation album was about ME.  ;)  Thanks for the clarification.

I was in the middle of the strip in Las Vegas for the midnight countdown. It
was my first time in Vegas, and OMG I had such a blast! I went with my
neighbors and their friend, and the four of us drove there on Tues, partied
all night long, then drove back yesterday. I had fun meeting and talking to
people from all over and dancing wherever I found music playing. Good Times!

Happy New Year everyone!

Happy  :-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Planet New Year - story in SFChronicle


Matt Stannard of the San Francisco Chronicle is one of the good guys.

I got jammed up around the time i first subbed to SFRaves, this was when I
was working temp at the Stanford Human Genome Center right around the time
the first draft of the human genome was sequenced, over a hit of e i got
busted with, and had to do a few weeks county time in San Mateo County Jail
in Redwood City, as a result.

This was prior to Prop 36.

Apollo and some others might remember some of my posts on this.

While I was in I met this guy who was like 4' 11', 120 lbs, smaller than my
g/f at the time, who had 38, 38 count 'em, 38, petty, misdemeanor priors,
because, well, he was a homeless, mental health case who should never have
been in the streets, and especially not in jail, but in a hospital,
receiving proper care for life.

Instead he lived in the streets and kept getting busted over the smallest of
shit.

Welcome to San Mateo County, the richest spot on earth, where being poor and
sick is the worst crime you can commit.

When i met him, he had some weird chafing  stuff going on on his arms, and
guys were avoiding him like the plague,  I'm curious as hell, by nature, so
i approached him to find out what was what.

His command of english was weak as well, but eventually got it out of him
and a few other guys who knew his story.

Turns out the flaking on his arms was from having his casts recently removed
by the doctors.

The reason why this guy was wearing casts was that he sassed back to a nurse
when she tried to get him to take his medication.

4 linebacker guards, each twice the size of me, rushed in on her say so and
broke both his arms for that.

Not only that, but they turned around and charged him with his *first* ever
felony for assault.

I called Matt when I got out, and he did what he could, they lawyered up on
him pretty good, and sealed records, but somehow realized that this might
not play in the court of public opinion and lowered the charge to a
misdemeanor, thanks to Matt's efforts.

So, there is trust there for him on my part.

I just left him a message to thank him for that, again.

I also asked that somehow, some counter-point gets worked into this
discussion.

I'll bet that there were more than two alcohol related traffic deaths, not
to mention, fights, emergency room visits, etc this past holiday period and
they aren't getting splashed over the Front Page, never mind that it's just
as tragic for the family and friends affected by that, yet two people die at
a rave this weekend and I get to hear about it here on the East Coast on a
local list because the story has been picked up and gone National?

Stop the press.

Matt, please, this is going to be a major ongoing story for the forseeable
future, and  a writer than can work some sense of rational perspective into
it will be a great asset.

Yes, we have drugs in this subculture and yes the attitudes towards them
don't carry the same emotional and moral freight as previous generations.

Yes, we stay up all dancing.

Yes, we see no need to constantly have apologize for this, never mind get
our parties busted and go to jail and have our Congress try to shut us down.

Yes, we are OK, productive members of our society, Matt, we wouldn't be
having this conversation if it weren't for the for the founder of this list,
he's a chief architect of a primary piece of software that makes the World
Wide Web run.

We're good people and we're tired of getting busted over nothing, and we
don't want to get mad about it, yet, but we would like someone to tell our
side of the story in a way that people can understand.

So, if it's all the same, we'd love it if you can help us out a little bit
and use your skills to add some balance to this otherwise hysterical
conversation.

Thank you.

Hope everyone had a great Nu Yrs, mine was pretty amazing, despite staying
in.

Regards,

nic

Hello SFR community,

I was just contacted by a staff writer for the SF Chronicle doing a
story on Planet New Year.

He's looking to talk to anyone that was there, that might have information
or perspective to help balance out the story. Surprisingly (or not), there
were a couple OD's + possibly other tragic events, he has info from
police, coroners, and companies, but wants to talk to the rave community
to get their feedback.

If you're so inclined here's his contact info:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BS Alert ! ! ! A New Year, Let's Re-Introduce Everyone On the List That Posts.

okay, this is a prime example of bs.  "aura delivery system" ?  all my sfraves email spools up in
the bulk mail folder of my hotmail account and i read it whenever i'm bored and looking for
interesting arguments to curtail with actual reasoning or initiate the hitler rule on.  for instance
there was one thread on the genuineness of delia's *ahem* boobies... that one was easy to prove ;)

Abby, i can appreciate your response and we take note of your concerns.
I've responded below to your comments;
 
 Abby <abbysweets154@yahoo.com> wrote:
Dear Coolworld,

I would like to thank you for that letter thanking
all your attendees and that oh so brief side note of
the two men that died at your party. At least you
chose to recognize it, although it was to a meager
degree.

 

--> I would imagine that your perception is your own reality and since you cannot hear someones tone of voice and you cannot see our faces i would expect that you at the very least would give Coolworld the benefit of the doubt when we say that we are extremly sadened by the loss of these two young men. Coolworld is just the name of our company, but the people behind the brand are all human beings who are sympathtic to any death anywhere at anytime.



You can give all the sympathies you want and the
deaths will never directly be targeted at you,
however, please be aware that in a large way they
indeed should be.

 

---> You've already made the decision in your head that we are to blame for these tragic events. So trying to discuss this with your narrow views is going to be difficult, with all respect...



Dancesafe, a nonprofit, harm reduction organization
promoting health and safety within the rave community,
as we understand was NOT permitted by any means at
your party. Your Production Crew, being a popular host
of these 'massive raves' is fully aware that there are
drugs like ecstacy present. It is only fact that many
of these pills are unsafe and harmful if not DEADLY to
its user. 


 

---> Dance safe was told that they could not come and test pills because simply put; it's illegal. You cannot have people testing pills and giving them back to people. It's technically against the law. So we welcome any organization to bring liteature to educate people on dangers of usage, etc. To our knowledge members of dancesafe were present passing out condoms.

 


But what can we expect from a large Production crew
who is solely there for profit? Of course you will
choose to be ignorant of these facts and take that
large risk to do what is 'politically correct' and not
allow this controversial yet postive group into your
parties. And look what it cost you? THE LOSS OF TWO
LIVES, who just maybe, otherwise wouldnt have been
lost if pill testing facilities were accesible. The
fact remains that there is little you can do to stop
drug use.

 

---> Abby, your making a ton of assumptions and actually have no facts. Your saying that because dance safe wasnt present that these two people died. Thats incorrect. Although dance safe performs a service that many people feel is important it doesnt stop people from using Drugs. It also doesnt mean that everyone is going to utlize dancesafe. Your also assuming this person took bad drugs. Ever stop to think that this person may have took the same stuff that many of your friends or aquantances may have taken also. Drugs can be dangerous and you take the risk everytime you use them. Fact is, we dont even know if this guy took exstacy.....we dont know what he took? or when he took what ever he took. What if this consumption occured before he entered the venue....is that are fault too?

 



I hope you actually choose to take these recent
events and do more than pretend to care abouth them by
offering less than a few words of your, "sympathies."

 

--> Again, your making an asumption that we dont care. YOUR WRONG. Were devistated. We just had a kick ass event with alomost NO problems all night long. All city officials, Cow Palace staff, security, and police have all agreed that this years festivities were the smoothest on record. Then, we are hit with a hail storm of information that we are still trying to clarify.

 



On a side note, you are a disgrace to rave culture.
You take what is something meaningful and blow it up,
leaving little left of what the real culture in
reality was. I hope that being the influential group
you are, you will choose to do something more positive
and pay back the true culture you borrowed your ideas
from. We don't stand for money-making, or bright laser
beams, we're a community built solely on four things; 
peace, love, unity, and RESPECT. Please, don't kill
it.

 

--> Addy, you are trully mis-informed. Hopefully with a little time your views will open up and realize that not one organization can be blamed for the downfall of your personal scene. It's easy to point figures and say were the greedy evil. It's harder to do research and discover your wrong. Coolworld is comprised of artist, dj's, and performers who love the very essence of this culture and the people with in it. We dont throw small parties in vacant warehouses like you prefer. We host large multi cultural gatherings with a variety of artist from all accrss the globe in legal venues. Different strokes for different folks. 

 

---> We do not want to get into a huge battle over massive vs. underground. Greedy vs. non proffit, shady, blah, blah, blah....it's all old and this list has seen it's fair share of massive promoter hatred. 

---> Lets wait to see what the facts are and see what actually happend....so that we can react with FACTUAL data rather then EMOTIONAL data. Right now information is still coming in and it's unclear of exactly what happened and when.

respect,

Coolworld

 

 

 



Thank you.
Sincerely,

Abby
somone who truly cares

I wasn't aware that there was a CORRECT way to party.  I didn't realize that 
there was a certain type of MUSIC that was good.  I didn't realize that some 
of the people who have poured their hearts and souls out for our Bay Area 
Scene were in fact money hungry talentless sell out bastards.

I want to thank you finally showing me the light.  From now on I will only 
play plastikman and squarepusher tunes.  From now on when I go to a party I 
will just stand there with my budweiser and critque every move the DJ makes.  
I will shop at GAP and Eddie Bauer for all my cloths.  I will make it a 
mission to talk sh*t about every trance dj alive.

Subject: ATP: [sfraves] A New Year, Let's Re-Introduce Everyone On the List That Posts.

.hmm introductions.

I am a 23 year old [ virgo ] graphic designer located on the Peninsula. Many 
who do know also realize that my name is not Jack Triumph; It is simply an 
alter-ego that I like to become when I get to rock the decks. I am Jason 
when I design; I am Jack when I spin. It is my release. Since I don't 
partake in many chemical alterings, this is my high. I started dj'ing 2 
years ago because the music I wanted to hear was not easily accessible. I 
could only get it on vinyl, so the next step is obvious. I have lost my 
faith completely in rock/rap/hip hop/pop/whatever. Sorry, but, that is how 
it is. Everything seems minuscule compared to the "electronic" format.

While I am not as well known as say mighty Chris Jackson, ;), I hope that 
2003 will be a better year for me to gain exposure. I work extremely long 
hours as a designer, so I don't really get a chance to go to a lot of 
undergrounds, gatherings, etc. I have been telling myself that I want to go 
to secret society for months now, but, hey what are you going to do. This 
really limits my chances to network with people and acquire new gigs. And 
with the my nasty vinyl buying habit, in 2 years I have purchased over 500 
records, that also cuts my budget down for going out. But, I try my hardest 
every time I play and in everything I do. Anyone who does know me will tell 
you that if I am into something, I am all the way.

Some who have read my posts in the past, it is not hard to figure out I am 
about as right-wing conservative as you can get. Does that make me a nazi? 
no. And if you think so, that is probably because you aren't intelligent 
enough to think for yourself. To me racism = affirmative action. I mean 
c'mon giving people opportunities because they aren't white male 
heterosexuals? And yes I can be bitter. I lost out to many a scholarship 
because I am exactly that. And no, my "rich" white parents couldn't afford 
to send me.

So, sorry to rant, happy to be hear; Progressive heads hit me up. I want to 
know where you all are at in 2003. I think it is going to be a good year for 
the dark, dirty beats.

Anyone want to get together to spin some vinyl and have some pints, hit me 
back, I have a great home setup.

I am an attorney in the Central Valley and my first
rave was in 94 when I got the privilege to check out
Psychic TV.  
The best party that I have been to in a while...that
is a difficult one.  I dug the Replicate camp out in
June in the Mendocino National forest the Trust folks
put on and some of the Sac DnB parties of 1998 & 99(a
rock climbing gym, ring bells to anyone?)
I don't party as much as I used to.  But I go every
once in a while and enjoy good vibes just as much as
the next guy. 
Kind of a lurker..but hey, who isn't. IM-- nagabrain

I'm not a member of Dancesafe so I may be incorrect in my 
following statement, but I was under the impression that 
their practice was to take a pill, scratch a bit off onto 
a plate, hand the pill back, and THEN test the pill.  I 
believe Dancesafe adheres to this practice without 
exception, because it IS illegal to give a pill back to 
someone when you KNOW it is a narcotic.  However, at the 
time the Dancesafe tester is handling the pill, they 
technically do not know if it is a narcotic or not... 
indeed it may not be, as many of their public test results 
show that some pills are just massive caffeine bombs.

Dancesafe's testing services should not be restricted from 
any event.  If promoters are afraid of the liability 
Dancesafe's presence may bring on, perhaps they should 
consider the greater ethical liability of prohibiting them 
from providing their harm reduction service.

always puts in too much effort, but there's no result.

*takes a deep breath*. Okay. Once again, I need to stand up for all the 
responsible teen ravers out there *many* of which are candy ravers. If you 
would have checked your facts, the two people that died at PNY were nineteen 
and twenty-three, *both* adults. And there are plenty of other incidents of 
drug "overdoses" that involved adults, not "giddy preteen candy kids" as you 
so quickly blamed. I'm so fucking sick of this, I'm sorry. I really resent 
what you said and all the others through the years on this list who have made 
narrow-minded, stereotypical, holier-than-thou "because I'm an adult and I 
don't wear candy" judgments on teenage ravers. You have a bit of growing up 
to do yourself if you are so quick to point the finger at teenagers alone for 
the rate of drug overdoses in the scene. 

Though yes, I might agree that someone attending their first rave might in 
some cases be a poor representation of the scene and therefore unfit to 
participate in an interview, I strongly disagree at your once again 
stereotypical comment about teenage candy ravers and the risk it would run to 
our scene's image if they were to be interviewed. I know that in my nearly 
four years on this list from age fourteen to eighteen I have received 
numerous e-mails in response to my posts thanking me for my insight, 
congratulating me on my intelligence and commenting on my excellent 
perception of the scene. And yes, I WAS A TEENAGE CANDY RAVER. 

Yes, there are probably a greater number of people who have been in the scene 
for many years able to more poignantly sum up rave culture and point out the 
positive aspects of it, but there are also many young candy ravers who could 
do the same or even shed a better, less jaded and less JUDGMENTAL light on 
the subject. I certainly would not want you to represent our scene in an 
interview. You, yourself would only be contributing further to the image the 
media has painted of a business fueled by naive drug obsessed teenagers. How 
productive would your above comments really be? 

What about pointing out the break down of community values? When was the last 
time you took a moment to educate a younger raver, take them to these 
underground parties you speak of and show them what the full spectrum of the 
rave scene has to offer? I'm tired of people pointing their righteous fingers 
at teenagers and then sitting back and doing nothing. How about we stop 
arguing about who is to blame and start DOING something about it? As I've 
always said, when you point a finger, three point back at you. Take a look at 
how you're helping to find a solution. And no, continuing to go to your 
parties of choice and dancing till dawn is not as productive as you think. 
Yes, you may be supporting honest promoters and sending out a positive 
message that way, but what good does that do if those teenagers you speak of 
never see it? Never hear your message? To me, that's just turning a blind eye 
away from the problem and hoping it will go away.

heart,
Alida

What does "soul" mean?  Emotion?  Good trance has it.

>there's no funk.

Sometimes there is.  And funk does not always a good dance 
record make.

>it's not sexy.

Sometimes it is.  Delerium's "Silence" can be seen as 
sexy... not Peaches or Miss Kittin sexy, but it works.

>it's immature.

I have to agree with that one, but good trance can be 
appreciated outside the teen bracket... I'm several years 
out of the bracket myself.

>it's too cartoonish.

Gotta agree with that too, but again good trance can 
conjure up "Princess Mononoke" rather than "SpongeBob 
Squarepants".

>there's too much predictability.

Often true.  Also true of most other genres.

>it's dull and uncolorful.

Eh?  Again, also true of most other genres.  If anything 
trance gets TOO colorful.  Drum arrangements in trance can 
get dull, but good melodies and basslines can make up for 
it.  IMHO trance is one of the least dull genres out 
there... on the other hand I wish happy hardcore were a 
HELL of a lot duller.

>trance always puts in too much effort, but there's no 
>result.

???

>trance is simply wasted vinyl. it's just weak. fuck trance. 

And back to the unhelpful critique.  Thanks for the good 
points though.

I'm pretty sure shawn was referring to the expected respondent to Terry's
post / the S.F. Chron guy, not to the type of people who tend to overdose
at parties.

Chill the fuck out, giddy teenage candy ravers everywhere! ;)

being involved with both dancesafe and law enforcement i'm gonna step in and 
support you on this one. nothing dancesafe does is illegal. it walks a very 
fine line, but does not break any penal codes or health and safety codes so 
is not technically illegal.

promoters, i have found, don't like the publicity that dancesafe brings. its 
like they think that by having us there they are admitting that they know 
there is drug use there. and its easier to "apologize" for a death than to 
admit you know there is a possibility that something illegal is going on at 
their party.

just my 2 cents.

"We await the day with relish that somebody dares to make a dance record
that consists of nothing more than an electronically programmed bass drum
beat that continues playing the fours monotonously for eight minutes.
Then, when somebody else brings one out using exactly the same bass drum
sound and at the same beats per minute (B.P.M.), we will all be able to
tell which is the best, which inspires the dance floor to fill the
fastest, which has the most sex and the most soul. There is no doubt, one
will be better than the other.  What we are basically saying is, if you
have anything in you, anything unique, what others might term as
originality, it will come through whatever the component parts used in
your future Number One are made up from."

 Although you make a technical point and it may seem perfectly legal and make all the sense in the world, when it comes to getting permits and permission to host a music festivals at a legal venues....pill testing isnt usually an option for the promoter. 
There is NO Legal Venue that we know of that can capacity over 10,000 people that allows pill testing. 
Dance safe has always been welcome to distribute liteature and they have at many of our events. 
I think it's important to realize that there are still risk and there are still dangers when consuming pure drugs. To say testing a pill is enough to prevent drug over doses is narrow minded. 
As for us taking a greater responsiblity for our patrons and there safety....I would inform you that Coolworld made Everyone with out exception take everything out of their pockets when searched and did not allow any bags or backpacks into the event. 
In addition Coolworld does not support or condone drug use period. We are not in the business of making it easier or safer for people to do drugs. Plain and simple. We dont want any illegal substances inside any of our events. 
I hope this clarifies are position on usage and testing. 
Again, since you cannot hear us and you can only read this, please do not think that we do not care about these recent occurences. Out tone is humble, and we are simply trying to investigate the matter and hopefully prevent this from happening again. 
Respect, 
Coolworld

I'm not a member of Dancesafe so I may be incorrect in my 
following statement, but I was under the impression that 
their practice was to take a pill, scratch a bit off onto 
a plate, hand the pill back, and THEN test the pill. I 
believe Dancesafe adheres to this practice without 
exception, because it IS illegal to give a pill back to 
someone when you KNOW it is a narcotic. However, at the 
time the Dancesafe tester is handling the pill, they 
technically do not know if it is a narcotic or not... 
indeed it may not be, as many of their public test results 
show that some pills are just massive caffeine bombs.

Dancesafe's testing services should not be restricted from 
any event. If promoters are afraid of the liability 
Dancesafe's presence may bring on, perhaps they should 
consider the greater ethical liability of prohibiting them 
from providing their harm reduction service.

Thank you for the thoughtful reply...

I was not aware of this.  Such venue owners bear heavy 
responsibility.

I completely agree.  If anything good comes out of these 
untimely deaths, I hope it's that they wake up young 
party-goers that they are neither immortal nor impervious 
to drugs' hazardous effects, whether they be pure or 
adulterated.

I'm not counting on it though.  :(

Security catches the big things -- guns, knives, a bag of 
2,000 pills, a giant bong -- but until they start 
crotch-fondling and anal-probing, those little pills will 
ALWAYS get in.  Security is necessary but will never be 
wholly effective.

Thanks again.  And I don't doubt your sorrow in this 
matter.

Alida, again....do not be so haste and quick to judgment. Dance safe has always been allowed to pass out pamphlets. Thats a no brainer. No harm no foul. 
However, Regardless of any interview you may see or hear, pill testing is widely not acceptable by police agencies, venues, etc. 
It presents a clear conflict of interest to all parties involved. Also, dance safe does not guarantee or prevent people from over dosing. Thats hypothetical and not something that you can present hard statistics for. 
Coolworld has never banned any organization from spreading educational material regarding any cause. Are doors are open for any prevention or eco conscious outfits who would like to represent there cause in our forum. 
I caution everyone not to jump to conclusions as facts are still unclear and have yet to be fully released. 
Respect, 
Coolworld

I was not questioning this, nor did I ever jump to say that the lack of pill 
testing is responsible for the deaths. It just seemed strange to me that 
DanceSafe says they were restricted to only passing out condoms while you say 
they were free to pass out their literature. I would just like to know who is 
telling the truth since there seem to be inconsistencies. Is it because it 
was the police that prevented them from passing pamphlets out, not you, that 
is to blame for this conflict of recollection?

        In regards to all this "Fuck Trance" bullshit on the list... I would 
just like to say if you dont like Trance, then ignore the topic... dont waste 
YOUR time by responding to what others are interested in and what you are 
not... There's just too much junk mail circulating and I would like to pass 
thru all the bullshit emails... 

Shit, if you like HOUSE music, and there's a HOUSE music topic in the email, 
respond to it... and if you don't like HOUSE music, just delete the email.... 


If you like D&B, and there's a D&B related email, respond to it... and if you 
don't like D&B, delete the email...

If you like TRANCE and there's a TRANCE related topic, respond to it... and 
if you don't like TRANCE, delete the email... 

It's so simple!!!


In the end, it's all just opinions, right??? 
Besides, opinions are like assholes, everyone has 'em... and half of the 
time, it stinks...

Just cut the bullshit because everyone on the list will appreciate it,
Lucky Nguyen.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PNY03 Aftermath & Re-cap...

Coming from the legal/business side of your event I can't even imagine the
hoops that must be jumped through to make the event occur. With the raves
being scrutinized by law enforcement, media and the public anything that can
be taken as condoning drug use will be misinterpreted by anyone outside the
scene. It's all about the rules of the *real world* which in this case is
law enforcement, the city, the venue owner and probably most key, the
insurance company for the event. There is the view that by pill testing the
promoter is openly accepting drug use at their event. This puts the venue
owner at legal and financial risk should someone get stupid, overdose/mix,
and have an incident that results in a later lawsuit. I don't like Dancesafe
not being able to keep those that choose to take a substance safer and more
educated yet that's how it has to be at a 10,000 person mini-massive.
Ignorance to raving has passed and taken on the form of sensationalism in
the public eye.

Events like Tantra this past week help undo some of the negetivity that is
generated at large events. But what really helps are when promoters like
Coolworld actively state they don't condone drug useage at their parties and
make an effort to curb it. They have to with so many people and so much
liability. In a sense it's just a game of odds. More people increases the
odds that someone is going to do something stupid at an event. Raving and
ravers need to talk about what goes on at parties and downplay drug useage
and focus on what they're really there for. I go for friends and music.

When I had pictures from the Excite party printed in Jane the reporter
pressed about drug useage at the party. I kept telling her that there was
none and people were just drinking. I likened it to a house party in an
office complex with a handful of people smoking weed. The article ended up
saying *...the drugs of choice were alcohol and marijauna...* which kinda
sounded bad, but not as bad as mentioning ecstacy or something like
ketamine. Divert attention and keep things focused. The world will get bored
of watching us closely in time...

Alida, again....do not be so haste and quick to judgment. Dance safe has
always been allowed to pass out pamphlets. Thats a no brainer. No harm no
foul.
However, Regardless of any interview you may see or hear, pill testing is
widely not acceptable by police agencies, venues, etc.
It presents a clear conflict of interest to all parties involved. Also,
dance safe does not guarantee or prevent people from over dosing. Thats
hypothetical and not something that you can present hard statistics for.
Coolworld has never banned any organization from spreading educational
material regarding any cause. Are doors are open for any prevention or eco
conscious outfits who would like to represent there cause in our forum.
I caution everyone not to jump to conclusions as facts are still unclear and
have yet to be fully released.
Respect,
Coolworld

To our knowledge members of dancesafe were present passing out condoms.

>From the article written in the Chronicle, also featured at
http://www.sfgate.com, about the event:

"But increasing concerns among promoters about liability for drug use has
led many to bar DanceSafe from their events, Llenes said. Such was the case
at the Cow Palace party.
"We weren't allowed to bring any of our literature. We weren't allowed to
bring our testing material," he said. "All we could do is pass out condoms."

Hmm.. something is a tad inconsitent here. So what's the truth? Because I
find it hard to believe that it is also illegal to pass out educational
pamphlets. And considering you have also already been pointed out as wrong
in regards to Dance Safe's method of pill testing being illegal...

So why is it that they were also not allowed to pass out their literature,
Coolworld? Is the media perhaps right and you are in fact lying to us to
protect your image as concerned, caring promoters?

heart,
Alida

 Abby <abbysweets154@yahoo.com> wrote:Dear Coolworld,

I would like to thank you for that letter thanking
all your attendees and that oh so brief side note of
the two men that died at your party. At least you
chose to recognize it, although it was to a meager
degree.

You can give all the sympathies you want and the
deaths will never directly be targeted at you,
however, please be aware that in a large way they
indeed should be.

Dancesafe, a nonprofit, harm reduction organization
promoting health and safety within the rave community,
as we understand was NOT permitted by any means at
your party. Your Production Crew, being a popular host
of these 'massive raves' is fully aware that there are
drugs like ecstacy present. It is only fact that many
of these pills are unsafe and harmful if not DEADLY to
its user. 

But what can we expect from a large Production crew
who is solely there for profit? Of course you will
choose to be ignorant of these facts and take that
large risk to do what is 'politically correct' and not
allow this controversial yet postive group into your
parties. And look what it cost you? THE LOSS OF TWO
LIVES, who just maybe, otherwise wouldnt have been
lost if pill testing facilities were accesible. The
fact remains that there is little you can do to stop
drug use.

I hope you actually choose to take these recent
events and do more than pretend to care abouth them by
offering less than a few words of your, "sympathies."

On a side note, you are a disgrace to rave culture.
You take what is something meaningful and blow it up,
leaving little left of what the real culture in
reality was. I hope that being the influential group
you are, you will choose to do something more positive
and pay back the true culture you borrowed your ideas
from. We don't stand for money-making, or bright laser
beams, we're a community built solely on four things; 
peace, love, unity, and RESPECT. Please, don't kill
it.

Thank you.
Sincerely,

Abby
somone who truly cares

Who fucking cares?! They don't want hippie scums at their event! That's the one good thing they're doing! too bad their music lineups are a fucking joke! They could really be promoting some quality acts. maybe those acts refuse to play a cheesefest more like.

I was not questioning this, nor did I ever jump to say that the lack of pill 
testing is responsible for the deaths. It just seemed strange to me that 
DanceSafe says they were restricted to only passing out condoms while you say 
they were free to pass out their literature. I would just like to know who is 
telling the truth since there seem to be inconsistencies. Is it because it 
was the police that prevented them from passing pamphlets out, not you, that 
is to blame for this conflict of recollection?

 I need to add myself to the roster sometime ( I haven't decided on a
picture yet - too vain! ).

 For history's sake, here's the SFRaves White Pages :

 http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/sf/people/

 and my old bio :

 http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/sf/people/lching.htm

 Can't say there's much to update since I wrote that stuff in the
mid-90's, except that I got married to a wonderful gal who doesn't
like raves ( or any even with large crowds ) but doesnt mind if I
go. Luckily for her and our marriage, like many who've been in
this scene for over a few years, I don't go out as much as I did .

 I mentioned in my old bio that I had hurt my back - it reoccurs,
in fact just this week, so we avoided all the big parties and just
went to a good little intimate house party.

 Oh, and there's a picture of me on this page :

 Happy 2003!

Aw heck, why not? Here's where I'm coming from...

I grew up in Connecticut during the 80's, only child of single mom. She
taught me all about what she considered the classics: from Pink Floyd to
Donna Summer, Hendrix and the Eagles, Elvis Costello and James Brown,
Bowie and the Talking Heads, Bob Marley and the Wailers. As I grew
older, she accepted my changing musical tastes because she remembered
what it was like for her in the 70's. I vividly remember playing with
Legos while listening to Funk Master Flex on Hot97. As the sound
changed, and acts like Kriss Kross became popular, I turned my attention
back towards rock, just in time to catch the explosion of grunge.
Flannel shirts, ripped jeans: I dreamed of living in Seattle.

Then one day, I heard Nine Inch Nails' "Pretty Hate Machine" from start
to finish, and fell in love with dark, moody electronic music. From
there, I went on to listen mostly to industrial: Skinny Puppy, Front
Line Assembly, and Front 242. My interest in Bill Leeb lead me to the
ambient works of Delerium. In '95, I heard a track by Aphex Twin on a
NIN remix EP, and was introduced to IDM: RDJ and his crew of mad
scientists; Meat Beat Manifesto; Future Sound of London and Oribtal; The
Prodigy.

Eventually I found myself living in Florida, having already moved from
CT to Nebraska, then to Georgia... all during my 3 1/2 years in high
school. I never really had time to make many friends, so I worked odd
jobs on weekends, and spent every dime I made on music (only to have
all my CD's stolen, *twice* -- I've since vowed never to keep a large
collection of music in my car, or take it travelling... thank you MP3's
and the iPod!).

At one point I even fell in with the punk crowd, and for a while found
myself at shows nearly every weekend, rocking out to the likes of Less
than Jake, AFI, NOFX, et al. I still enjoyed the darker side of rock,
then embodied by Marilyn Manson and Nick Cave. But EDM eventually won me
back. When everything that wasn't pop generally became labelled as
"electronica", it was easy to get exposed to many different types of
music: the Bristol trip-hop sound (Portishead, Tricky, Smith and
Mighty); poppy techno (Underworld, Fluke); even trance (I really dug
Juno Reactor for a bit). Fatboy Slim and the Chemical Brothers were at
one time my favorite acts. Then Massive Attack led me to Tracey Thorn,
and her involvement with Ben Watt in Everything But the Girl. Yet I
still had never heard the term "house" used in a musical context.

I graduated early from high school and took a scholarship at the
University of Central Florida as a computer science major. Two semesters
in, I spat in the face of the Florida educational system and packed up
for San Francisco. After a short stint at the Academy of Art (I was
already doing web design on the side, but I had to enroll somewhere if
my mom was to support my move), I took a job at a small web startup,
where I found myself working alongside Mike Migurski, who turned me on
to sfraves. At the same time, I started dating a cocktail waitress (with
a penchant for Jeno and Mark Farina) who worked at the Hi-Fi Lounge,
where I met the venerable Jesse Martinez and Dwight Johnson, who
formally introduced me to house music.

Little did I know, I also worked in the midst of a relatively popular
breaks DJ, Sheri Mosley (AKA Madame Mercury). Shortly before she quit to
persue a full-time music career, she convinced our boss to purchase
turntables and a pair of Mackie monitors for the office. I started
buying random records, and spent nearly every day after work teaching
myself to DJ. On weekends, I trainspotted at the Hi-Fi, and gleaned from
my mentors how (and where) to find decent vinyl.  Eventually, I
purchased the pair of Technics 1200's that I continue to use today.

My musical tastes fluctuated when I first started DJ'ing: from banging
vocal house, to 2-step, to dark drum and bass, to downtempo and hip-hop.
House, however, seems to have captured my heart because it brings
together so many other sounds: disco, jazz, dub, funk, techno... It just
seems "right" to me. I'm just thrilled to be in the bay area right now,
with so much talent focused on creating really good music.

A short time after I subscribed, Apollo announced on sfraves his
intentions for creating a new collective. Having already read the
entirety of this House 101 series, I giddily replied to his request for
interested members. The Moksha Tribe met for the first time at an
informal house party, where some 20-odd strangers DJ'd and socialized.
There, I met many of the people that would eventually become my best
friends, a talented, intelligent, and passionate group of like-minded
folks with the desire to change the world through music and dance.
Aboriginal was a truly life-altering experience for me.

Nowadays, I don't really go out much, and that's something I'm going to
work on for the new year. Because when I do, I am simply dumbfounded by
the dedication of the community in the bay area. Nowhere else have I
encountered such a genuine passion for music and dance. I only hope that
one day I'll be able to repay the scene... be it by continuing to throw
kick-ass parties with the Moksha Tribe, playing quality music for anyone
willing to listen, or perhaps even making some myself. :)

Hey all, this is George Cochrane.  I play in the live-ish house duo
dj2- ya mighta seen us at the SFR 10-year party.  I run a tiny record
label called newstylesound.  We're about to release our second 12"
single.  I play bass and drums most of the time, but also play enough
keyboard to get parts down and I like to sing.  

I'm an experienced recording engineer and a fledgeling dj- I love love
love to spin funky, deep house, and scratch 70s synthesized classical
records on top.  I buy afro-cuban-influenced house records as fast as I
can find them.  Every time I try spinning a new genre, it's like
playing a new video game.  If I had the money to record shop like I
really want to, I'd have a house full of 12s!  :)

I love music an awful, awful lot, really most of it.  There are a few
genres I'm less into but you may be into them so I won't list them. 
I've been in a billion bands but these days find it more rewarding to
work up music by myself and with friends in the studio.  I find nothing
more fun or engaging than musical collaboration- even just relaxed,
smoky nights of knob twiddling and laughs.  

I plan to make music for the rest of my life.  In fact, I'd better,
because I start to go completely apesh*t when I'm unable to for more
than a day or so.  

I love this area, and the people I meet, the parties I go to, the
clubs, the djs, fellow producers and musicians..  It's just all so
good, so positive.  It all ebbs and flows, people come into the scene,
and exit it, and come back.  If you look at it too hard it looks
drama-prone but really we're all just a bunch of sensitive saps.  We
need to take ourselves less seriously and our future more seriously. 
This nye death stuff is very scary.  Here's a new years resolution for
the bay area- NO MORE MONEY-DRIVEN MEGA MASSIVES.  

Just my opinion.

Anyhow, that's me, I'm at newstylesound on AIM, feel free to say hey. 
There is a shedload of music of mine up at www.djorigami.com.

Cheers,
George C.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A New Year, Let's Re-Introduce Everyone On the List That Posts.

My name is Happy. I am fairly new to "the scene" compared to all the
oldskoolers here, but I've been a raver all my life and just didn't know it.
I am a very positive, optomistic and upbeat person. I try to give back to
the scene by educating the cynics and the "pre-teen candy ravers" about the
simple things like the value of hugging for hugging's sake, and the joy of
giving away things like toys and candy to total strangers. I try to follow
the golden rule and help those in need. I will never be a jaded raver
because I look to Apollo as my example of how you can be happy and positive
throught your life, even when many would say that you are too old to do the
things you do. 2002 was a great year for me. It was when I joined this list
and became a part of this wonderful family. I look forward to the new year
and wish you all health, happiness and success in all your endeavours.

Love,

Happy  :-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PNY03 Aftermath & Re-cap...

I find it amusring that coolworld will come on SFRaves and try to spread
bold-faced lies about DanceSafe, when it's no secret that more than a few
current and ex volunteers read and post, and one currently active DS volunteer
IS a pretty regular SFRaver.

I've been a volunteer with DanceSafe for just over a year and a half now.  And
both Alida and Carter are correct.  Pill testing is legal.  It's controversial,
yes.  But it *IS* legal.  Coolworld was flat out 100% lieing when they said
otherwise.

Carter is correct.  No volunteer at a DanceSafe table is EVER knowingly in
possetion of a controlled substance.  The testing procedure, to which ALL
chapters and volunteers MUST adhere, explicitly states that the pill is
scraped, returned to the raver, and then and ONLY then is the test performed. 
The test destroys the sample.  Thus we never knowingly posses ANY drug, real or
fake.  ALL chapters and volunteers MUST adhere to this procedure, the whole
point of which is to avoid breaking the law and shield us from liability.  If
anyone fails to do so, they are expelled from the organization.

Do you really think that we could exist as an incorperated organization (a
fully certified 501(c)3 non=profit even) if we hadn't consulted with legal
council about this point?

If pill testing were "illegal", as coolworld claims, then why were we
pill-testing out in the open, in full view of the public, and with the full
support of the committee AND the district attorney during ALL of Pride
(including the circuit party) this year?  What about at the Castro and Folsom
fairs, again in full view of the public and any patrolling police.  What about
at the innumerable other raves where pill testing was allowed.  None of this is
in dispute.  At Pride, the committee even advretised the pill testing service
for us in the Pride 2002 guide book, and gave us a choice spot in the parade
(yeah... my goofy ass was on TV...)!

FACT:  DanceSafe has never been alowed to pill-test at a coolworld event
because COOLWORLD refuses to allow it.  The buck stops there, nowhere else.

So long as I've been involved with the organization, DanceSafe has only been
allowed into ONE coolworld party, that being LAST year's PNY.  And even THEN it
was only due to the incessant and heroic efforts of one of our LOCAL promoters,
with whom coolworld had partnered that time around.

I was one of the volunteers working that one, actually.  Though you may not
have seen us.  Coolworld stuck us in an obscure corner of one of the secondary
rooms.  End even though we were there, all sorts of ridiculous restrictions
were placed on us.  For example, we were only allowed to distribute durex brand
condoms (one of our volunteers had to sort through ALL of our free condoms,
picking out and discarding all of the non-durex ones).  And pill testing, and
even sales of testing kits, was strictly verboten.

Personally, that experience was the final straw for me (granted, with their
unbroken recored of lies, deciet, and exploitation I didn't exactly have a
positive view of them, even going into that one), guaranteeing that I will
never ever set foot in a coolworld "event" for ANY reason. They just don't care
about anything except extracting every last possible dollar from the rave
scene. And if someone has to die for them to get that dollar, so be it.

It's important to note that this IS my personal opinion tho, not chapter
policy.  DS is there for ALL ravers, even those who support coolworld's
actions. And the SF chapter will be wherever there are ravers, *IF* the
promoters ask and/or allow us.


cya,
john

Woo hoo! Go John! Thank you for clarifying some things and shedding some=20
light on the awful truth.

Know your local promoters!

And I'm sorry, I just don't agree with the business argument people are=20
saying. If being able to throw your events means consequently adding more=20
fuel to the media fire while also compromising an incredible health benefit=20
available to some people who are going to take drugs whether you scorn it or=
=20
not is ridiculous. If the scene was so important to you you would look at=20
what your events are adding to the overall picture. Just curious, not even t=
o=20
imply anything, how many OD's/hospital visits etc have happened at Coolworld=
=20
events total? Anyone know?

heart,
Alida

IMO,

They don't need to be lying to us.  To have Dancesafe present at an event 
is acknowledging that their will be drugs there.  If DS isn't allowed, and 
searches are made, and security hired, Coolworld can claim that they tried 
to prevent drugs from entering the event.  Letting DS into the event is 
admitting that their screening process isn't perfect, which sets them up 
for liability.

ps I'm not stoked about Coolworld, and I'm never happy to hear of any death.

Hmmm well ok here it goes...
I'm The Hopeles Wonder, known as Drew to most of my friends and co =
workers.  I am floundering in a meaningles exsistance working for Lithia =
Ford of Concord selling new Fords and assorted used cars (if anyone =
needs a car there is a raver discount! :-)  ).  I aspire to someday be a =
good DJ.  For now though I go crazy in the confines of my house.  I spin =
progressive and psy trance.  Not a big funky music fan at all.  Some D&B =
every once in awhile really hits the spot and I get a kick out of Breaks =
most of the time (except for that NuSkool stuff).  I'm 20 years old and =
living back with my mom after living and starving on my own for a little =
over a year.  I joined the list in October after moving up here from the =
Central Coast where I ran (and continue to run) the raver calendar there =
(http://www.ccraves.org).  My day to day activities as the depressed =
anti superhero can be tracked and influenced through my website: =
http://www.fozzee.net/drewby/ (my life is an interactive web =
experience.... oh what a loser I really am).  Anyway.... thats about me.

Drew the Hopeles Wonder

OMFG!! These guys are still doing this?

When I started as a freshman at UCLA in '92, a bunch of people in my dorm
fell victim to this scam.. Of course, back then, a pair of these "overstock"
speakers was $150 - that's inflation for ya!  Admittedly, the speakers did
sound pretty damn good, but after about a month or so, the coils would start
going bad.  I didn't feel TOO bad for the suckers that fell for it - college
freshmen who have that kinda money to burn on stuff sold out of white vans
don't have much of my sympathy! It took every bit of willpower not to spend
what few extra bucks I had on legitimately sold items... ;)

Whoops, I didnt mean to hit ^X.

About 3 years ago, two guys in a white van tried to scam a friend and I
with the same speakers, but we didnt fall for it. 2 years later the same
guys tried to scam my friend and his friend at a different location...  I
cant believe they are still running this scam aswell.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Chris/Andy/ANYONE: Why Is Trance Inferior to
 House/Techno/Etc.?


I'm not asking anybody to blindly follow me or opinions...

It's not "inferior", I just rarely hear creative trance, or wickedly mixed
trance, or trance that doesn't shop off a shelf of cliches in the
production or the mixing.

There are some good trance DJs in the bay area, but the pyramid is
completely upside down, and many of our local "big names" seriously
fucking suck.

We're welcome to our preferences.  I'm not trying to sway anybody cause
it's me saying it or because it's "cool" or whatever, I'm trying to sway
if what I say makes sense to you.

I happen to think the only honest way a DJ can play other people's records
and approach being an artist is by dropping what they are feeling and
going somewhere with it.  To me, that means crossing genres, having fun
with the mixer, playing a set that is based on what they're getting back
from the crowd right there and then (not just some set they worked out at
home).. and I don't hear that from most trance Djs, particularly the
biggest names of the area.

Big-buck raves not all the rage to veterans
New Year's chaos proves dangers of excess, they say

James Sullivan, Chronicle Pop Culture Critic   Saturday, January 4, 2003

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



San Francisco -- Two deaths at a New Year's Eve dance at the Cow Palace 
have drawn into sharp focus the generation gap between old raves and the 
newer mega-events.

The rave scene was created largely in the Bay Area by a network of devoted 
revelers who merged the psychedelic and cyber eras. As raves have gone 
commercial -- in sports arenas and civic auditoriums, with vendors, ATMs 
and $5 bottles of water -- some old-schoolers have returned to the 
underground, holding rave-style parties in private residences and galleries.

The suspected overdose deaths of Peter Hoang, 19, of Stockton and Michael 
James Uveges, 23, also known as DJ Mikey Vegas, of Rohnert Park have 
heightened concerns over huge dance parties such as the New Year's Eve 
event at the Cow Palace.

The vice mayor of Daly City pledged Friday to tighten restrictions on 
future events, while defenders said such measures would drive raves back 
underground, where there are no institutionalized health and safety 
precautions.

But many veteran ravers have already returned to the underground, or at 
least to a smaller scale. They say the enormous, chaotic arena bashes -- 
10, 400 attended promoter's Coolworld's Planet New Year 2003 at the Cow 
Palace -- are a far cry from the eccentric, intimate happenings they first 
envisioned.


LOWER-KEY EVENTS PREFERRED

Grant Davis, 35, a Salt Lake City native who manages the Dimension 7 video 
gallery and serves as treasurer of the San Francisco Late Night Coalition, 
moved to the Bay Area a decade ago to take part in the burgeoning, wildly 
creative rave scene. The size and mall-style atmosphere of today's large 
dance events hold little attraction for him.

"I honestly can't say I've been to a big event like that in a number of 
years."

His generation of ravers, he said, prefers their gatherings a little lower- 
key these days. "People my age don't need it to be so flashy, so loud."

As raves, first held in remote fields and abandoned warehouses, have gone 
mainstream in recent years, they have attracted a younger clientele.

That mainstreaming is precisely the turnoff for Sunshine Jones, whose 
raving dates back to the '80s. For him, there is little connection between 
the early clandestine dance parties and the huge aboveground events of today.

" 'Rave' as a concept was 10 years ago," said Jones, who runs a San 
Francisco record company, Imperial Dub Records, with his wife, Moonbeam. 
The New Year's Eve event at the Cow Palace "was just a big event," he said. 
"It wasn't a rave."

Many elements of raves -- the sternum-thumping beats, the visual stimuli -- 
remain in place from the early days. But for some of the old-schoolers, the 
organizing principle of "plur" (peace, love, unity, respect) has become 
just another selling point.

Once the events become "that pop or commercial," said Davis, "the whole 
'plur' thing becomes a commodity item, to sell the event. It definitely 
doesn't have that kind of idealism anymore."


DRUG CONNOTATIONS IN 'RAVE'

The term "rave" itself is becoming outdated. Promoters and venue operators 
are downplaying the word, which has taken on drug-related connotations over 
the years.

Michael Wegher, general manager of the Cow Palace, said he wouldn't 
categorize the New Year's Eve event as a rave at all. "It was booked as a 
youth festival. This was a mainstream event."

Barry Synoground is general manager of the DNA Lounge, the 11th Street 
nightclub in San Francisco that hosts many state-of-the-art events with 
disc jockeys.

"There's a big difference between going to a dance party where you feel a 
great connection to everyone -- and yeah, maybe a few people are high, but 
they're not causing problems -- as opposed to (an event with) a huge number 
of younger people experimenting with drugs and a new culture. It's not as 
enjoyable to people who have been going out a long time."

But if there is a growing generation gap among ravers, drug use is not 
necessarily the issue. Many dance enthusiasts of all ages argue that drug 
abuse is no more prevalent in their scene than it is in many other social 
contexts. The scene, they say, has always celebrated the euphoria of high- 
energy music and the welcoming diversity of the "tribal gatherings."

"Anyone who has been to a 49ers or Raiders game lately can tell you that 
there are more fights, injuries and ejections there than at any rave," said 
Tomas Palermo, editor of San Francisco's XLR8R Magazine, which covers the 
dance scene.


CANCELLATIONS BRING LAWSUITS

Promoter Coolworld, which declined comment, has hosted past events marred 
by busy paramedics and multiple arrests, primarily for the sale of 
marijuana and ecstasy. The promoter is suing Santa Clara County for 
canceling events booked into the County Fairgrounds in summer 2000, 
according to Deputy County Counsel Gregory Sebastinelli.

In canceling the shows, the county cited the "predictable and widespread 
use of illegal drugs by crowds, including thousands of juveniles" at 
earlier Coolworld events. The New Year's Eve event at the Cow Palace was 
open to all ages.

Representatives of one safety advocacy group, DanceSafe, say they are 
increasingly forbidden to set up booths at commercial events by promoters 
mindful of any suggestion that there might be drugs on the premises.

Instead of prohibiting events, authorities should concentrate on enhancing 
safeguards, argued John Wood, legal analyst for the San Francisco Late 
Night Coalition.

"There's a chain reaction that occurs. Rather than intelligent policy, it 
leads to authorities trying to take away people's rights to gather.

"I don't feel that it's in the interest of the city to do that, because 
then people are gathering in unpermitted parties. They don't go home. They 
don't stop trying to have a good time. And if they're going to do drugs, 
they're going to do them."

Amazing... A neutral report on the state of affairs from a viewpoint that
most of us share. Proof that the media isn't the dark empire all the time
like some would make it out to be.

Hi there, guys...

        I was really worried about this article, especially after
all of our discussions and remembering all of the trouble that came
about with ppl from the scene trusting 20/20, ABC and other such
major media outlets in the past.  Personally, I thought that this
was one of the most fair articles that I've read in a long time,
with outstanding quotes from our scene being featured quite
prominently.

    It did not focus on the drug-rave connection; rather it made
great inroads at dispelling that relationship myth and showing how
it is not any different than the drug/alcohol relationship at any
other large event.  Barry's quote and Thomas Palermo's quote are
some of the best one's printed by others in our scene in a long
time.  Sunshine Jones' quote also pointed out a very important
distinction that needed to be told to the general public between
what we now consider "raves" and large, mainstream dance parties.
Makes me proud of our scene here in SF.

    The absolute tragedy of the two deaths, however, bears a heavy
cloud on all of this optimism.  Take care...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PNY03 Aftermath & Re-cap...


I think the issue is that promoters think it's easier to walk the party
line, which is there won't be any drugs here.  That's impossible, it's
writing a check they simply cannot cash... a gamble that this year
resulted in at least two deaths.  Adding security and on hand medical
staff is expensive, but it *increases* your probablity of getting a
permit.  Having DanceSafe at your event is free, but reduces the
probability of landing those same permits.  The issue is more municipal
government (the entities that handle permit approval) and less the
promoters themselves.

Reality is that drugs get in.  Despite searches, metal detectors, no
backpack rules, etc... "good kids" get their grubby little paws on drugs.
When good kids take good drugs, well, that's considered an issue to most
(myself included, I hate hearing about the stuff like 15 year old girls
brought in for hospital visits, it's sick).  But when good kids take bad
drugs, a second issue arises, one that can result in far more problems,
hospital visits, permanent health damage and death.

DanceSafe works in this reality based realm, in a harm reduction capacity.
We know that there is a risk associated with the judicious use of MDMA.
But it's nothing compared to the risks associated with ingestion of PMA,
DXM, and other substances used in "street E".

A cursory glance at the eyes of many people at nightclubs, raves and
"music festivals" will tell you the truth.

The same way that handing out condoms passes a certain vibe of "it's ok to
have sex", drug testing passes out a vibe of "it's ok to use drugs"... but
remember that in both cases the punishment for failing these safety checks
can be severe illness and death.  It's not what we want our kids doing,
but isn't it worth reducing the risks of such behavior if it is a
widespread issue?  Chances are an urban youth *will* be exposed to drug
use, sex, gangs and other elements.  The best way to protect them is
through a multi layer strategy of information, morality, harm reduction
and communication.  Refusing to admit that those things exist, and
blanketly stating that "drugs are bad don't take them" results in what we
have here.  I'd like to think that none of those kids thought they were
signing up for anything worse than a night of pretty lights and hanging
out with friends to pounding music, but now it's a different situation.
They died.  The end.

To anybody who thinks they are somehow better than those two guys, ask
yourself if you have every taken untested E, and ask yourself what kind of
deal you'd be making with your creator as you saw the lights going dim and
realized you might have taken something that was killing you.  Or your
friend.  Or your brother.  Or just some kid who bumped into you earlier
that night and smiled as he turned around to apologize.

It's not Coolworld's policy, it's a city-county-state policy thing.  It's
hard to get permits together for a large event, but the fact is that
policies that Coolworld agreed to because of permit pressures might have
made the difference between 2 deaths and a couple people out $20 and
feeling like suckers.

Is promoting morality more important than preserving life?

Being a veteran of 12 + years in the scene  I agree with most of this except the psychedelic part is mainly a hippie spin. If anything it was a virtual reality/computers and techno/technology thing with synthetic dance beats and sounds. the rest is a hippie spin that i'm not a part of nor did i present that in my events. buzzwords like plur was never used with us. sf is that way though, you go to l.a. and the hippie stuff is non existant. other than that i agree that these aren't even raves. true raves died in 93 imo. please don't get mad that's just how i saw it.

Big-buck raves not all the rage to veterans
New Year's chaos proves dangers of excess, they say

James Sullivan, Chronicle Pop Culture Critic Saturday, January 4, 2003

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



San Francisco -- Two deaths at a New Year's Eve dance at the Cow Palace 
have drawn into sharp focus the generation gap between old raves and the 
newer mega-events.

The rave scene was created largely in the Bay Area by a network of devoted 
revelers who merged the psychedelic and cyber eras. As raves have gone 
commercial -- in sports arenas and civic auditoriums, with vendors, ATMs 
and $5 bottles of water -- some old-schoolers have returned to the 
underground, holding rave-style parties in private residences and galleries.

The suspected overdose deaths of Peter Hoang, 19, of Stockton and Michael 
James Uveges, 23, also known as DJ Mikey Vegas, of Rohnert Park have 
heightened concerns over huge dance parties such as the New Year's Eve 
event at the Cow Palace.

The vice mayor of Daly City pledged Friday to tighten restrictions on 
future events, while defenders said such measures would drive raves back 
underground, where there are no institutionalized health and safety 
precautions.

But many veteran ravers have already returned to the underground, or at 
least to a smaller scale. They say the enormous, chaotic arena bashes -- 
10, 400 attended promoter's Coolworld's Planet New Year 2003 at the Cow 
Palace -- are a far cry from the eccentric, intimate happenings they first 
envisioned.


LOWER-KEY EVENTS PREFERRED

Grant Davis, 35, a Salt Lake City native who manages the Dimension 7 video 
gallery and serves as treasurer of the San Francisco Late Night Coalition, 
moved to the Bay Area a decade ago to take part in the burgeoning, wildly 
creative rave scene. The size and mall-style atmosphere of today's large 
dance events hold little attraction for him.

"I honestly can't say I've been to a big event like that in a number of 
years."

His generation of ravers, he said, prefers their gatherings a little lower- 
key these days. "People my age don't need it to be so flashy, so loud."

As raves, first held in remote fields and abandoned warehouses, have gone 
mainstream in recent years, they have attracted a younger clientele.

That mainstreaming is precisely the turnoff for Sunshine Jones, whose 
raving dates back to the '80s. For him, there is little connection between 
the early clandestine dance parties and the huge aboveground events of today.

" 'Rave' as a concept was 10 years ago," said Jones, who runs a San 
Francisco record company, Imperial Dub Records, with his wife, Moonbeam. 
The New Year's Eve event at the Cow Palace "was just a big event," he said. 
"It wasn't a rave."

Many elements of raves -- the sternum-thumping beats, the visual stimuli -- 
remain in place from the early days. But for some of the old-schoolers, the 
organizing principle of "plur" (peace, love, unity, respect) has become 
just another selling point.

Once the events become "that pop or commercial," said Davis, "the whole 
'plur' thing becomes a commodity item, to sell the event. It definitely 
doesn't have that kind of idealism anymore."


DRUG CONNOTATIONS IN 'RAVE'

The term "rave" itself is becoming outdated. Promoters and venue operators 
are downplaying the word, which has taken on drug-related connotations over 
the years.

Michael Wegher, general manager of the Cow Palace, said he wouldn't 
categorize the New Year's Eve event as a rave at all. "It was booked as a 
youth festival. This was a mainstream event."

Barry Synoground is general manager of the DNA Lounge, the 11th Street 
nightclub in San Francisco that hosts many state-of-the-art events with 
disc jockeys.

"There's a big difference between going to a dance party where you feel a 
great connection to everyone -- and yeah, maybe a few people are high, but 
they're not causing problems -- as opposed to (an event with) a huge number 
of younger people experimenting with drugs and a new culture. It's not as 
enjoyable to people who have been going out a long time."

But if there is a growing generation gap among ravers, drug use is not 
necessarily the issue. Many dance enthusiasts of all ages argue that drug 
abuse is no more prevalent in their scene than it is in many other social 
contexts. The scene, they say, has always celebrated the euphoria of high- 
energy music and the welcoming diversity of the "tribal gatherings."

"Anyone who has been to a 49ers or Raiders game lately can tell you that 
there are more fights, injuries and ejections there than at any rave," said 
Tomas Palermo, editor of San Francisco's XLR8R Magazine, which covers the 
dance scene.


CANCELLATIONS BRING LAWSUITS

Promoter Coolworld, which declined comment, has hosted past events marred 
by busy paramedics and multiple arrests, primarily for the sale of 
marijuana and ecstasy. The promoter is suing Santa Clara County for 
canceling events booked into the County Fairgrounds in summer 2000, 
according to Deputy County Counsel Gregory Sebastinelli.

In canceling the shows, the county cited the "predictable and widespread 
use of illegal drugs by crowds, including thousands of juveniles" at 
earlier Coolworld events. The New Year's Eve event at the Cow Palace was 
open to all ages.

Representatives of one safety advocacy group, DanceSafe, say they are 
increasingly forbidden to set up booths at commercial events by promoters 
mindful of any suggestion that there might be drugs on the premises.

Instead of prohibiting events, authorities should concentrate on enhancing 
safeguards, argued John Wood, legal analyst for the San Francisco Late 
Night Coalition.

"There's a chain reaction that occurs. Rather than intelligent policy, it 
leads to authorities trying to take away people's rights to gather.

"I don't feel that it's in the interest of the city to do that, because 
then people are gathering in unpermitted parties. They don't go home. They 
don't stop trying to have a good time. And if they're going to do drugs, 
they're going to do them."

I was initially fearful when I opened the paper this morning and found the 
article on the front page.  I agree, however, that this journalism was the 
most objective I've seen on the subject in some time.

I came into raving through the Wicked FMRs ten years ago.  Wonder what I 
would have thought of the community if my entry point was the commercial 
massives.  There are many houses in the general dance community,  and I 
believe philosophically that it's good for everyone, young and old, to 
dance.  I wish, however, that pre-college age kids had better options than 
large commercial dance festivals.  I came to raving after nearly twenty 
years in club culture and raving for me was an energizing and 
transformative experience -- a welcome break from the booze and booty 
focus.  Things changed when the FMRs went from a couple hundred on the 
beach to thousands.  I doubt I would have become the radical devotee of the 
raving scene that I am if my first party was a 10,000 person event.

I do see the massives as a possible entry point for many into the more 
intimate, underground parties.  There will always be those who become bored 
and/or disenchanted with the commercial scene and find their way to the 
underground driven by curiosity and their passion for the music and 
dance.  That's why I believe in keeping the ug all ages.  We should welcome 
those who diligently search for more.

Massives are mass market EDM, and that is fine and American.  But to throw 
massives one must adhere to majority beliefs about drug use which eschews 
harm reduction for abstinence and operates, as in the sexual arena, on 
beliefs that are dangerously unrealistic.  When problems occur, as they 
will, all of the dance community suffers.  This is a larger societal issue 
of course, but the blame falls in our laps.  Harm reduction and treatment 
programs for abuse are rational approaches to this issue but we, 
unfortunately, don't live in a reasonable society.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PNY03 Aftermath & Re-cap...

I don't get it?  Why must we always criticize coolworld after every damn 
rave/festival they throw?  We all know that the same stuff is going to 
happen each and every rave/festival they throw.  This event oh so sadly 
ended in death.  Which is VERY unfortunate.  Trust me I am no way shape or 
form associated with/wanting to be associated with coolworld.  I am just 
dissapointed in some of you.  You guys constantly say that you are in it for 
the "scene", the "scene" this, the "scene" that, I am protecting the scene 
blah blah blah....Why is it that you always criticize the massive promoters? 
  All they are trying to do is host an event that WE(yes, you and i SFRaves) 
can go to and dance our asses off to some great music.  Sure coolworld's 
events are more on a larger scale, but who else brings out that kind of 
talent?  Obviously none of the smaller collectives/promoters don't.  Why?  I 
don't know.  When you get 10,000+ people under one roof havok will evolve.  
It's just like high school.  Try and fuse the freshmans and the seniors 
together.  It won't work.
Coolworld in reality doesn't throw "raves", but throw massive music 
festivals.  These festivals solely rotate around "electronica/techno" music. 
  Look at woodstock, look at up in smoke tour, look at all the massive 
promoters who throw the same type of event, but different genre of music.  
Why, why, why must we always critique promoters in the rave scene.  Ridicule 
them for stuff they can not control.  Ridicule them for not allowing "dance 
safe" into their event. blah blah blah.  People it really is getting old.  I 
know half of you don't even go to "massive festivals" simply because of what 
goes on at these type of events.  The people that do go on the other hand 
don't criticize smaller collectives for throwing parties.  Do they?


thanks for reading.....


peace,
Aaron

Ha...I'm beyond quibbling with terms these days.  They are only meaningful 
when one is under attack:)  I throw non-profit, unpermitted parties for the 
love of it.  Call them undergrounds, call them "saves"...no matter.  Point 
is, the motivation is not commercial but, rather, to create free spaces 
where people can celebrate life through EDM and dance.  Hippies, techno 
rebels, candy kids, virtual reality freaks, insurance salesmen, and 
everyone else is welcome if they wish to dance in a respectful, peaceful 
environment.  The term PLUR wasn't around at the time of the Wicked or 
Moonshine FMRs, but the vibe they represented were IMHO.  Hell, all this is 
evolutionary...

My new years resolution is to actually go on a date.  Maybe ;)   That and
also to realize that work isin't as important as my happiness and
creativity.  Time to actually spend alot of time in the studio.

Subject: [sfraves] compound records going out of business

as seen on the groundscore message board:

"Compound Records San Francisco will be closing its doors for business on
Friday Jan 24. Unfortunately, the economy and scene are not conducive to us
continuing to operate at this time. We.d like to thank everyone for their
support during the last four years and ask that you keep watching us for
bigger and better projects coming soon. From now until Jan 24 everything in
our inventory will be 60% off (12.s, EPs, LPs, CDs). This means all 12"
singles are $3.99!! We also just finished taking inventory so our online
stock is now completely accurate. Questions and comments may be directed to
info@compoundrecords.com. 

Thanks once again, 
Compound Records"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PNY03 Aftermath & Re-cap...

You make some good points, and I'm not speaking for everybody here, but 
it would seem as though the current situation is a little bit different. 
 Yes bad things happen at all large scale events, regardless of their 
purpose.  Its just a fact of life when masses of people get together, 
shit happens.  

However, I don't see the media portraying rock concerts, hip hop shows 
or sporting events in the same light that they shine on the EDM scene. 
 The simple fact of the matter is that the massive promoters have 
hijacked something and turned it into something it was never meant to 
be, nor capable of being, and the result has been a nonstop train of 
disasters.  When bad things happen at a big rock show, you don't see 
senators up on their podiums thumping their fists and condeming all rock 
shows, big and small alike, as being death traps and drug havens that 
they must rid the world of.  

The reason massive promoters in the EDM scene get criticism when shit 
goes wrong at their events, while other massive promoters of other 
entertainment media don't get criticised, is probably an answer to a 
question that nobody will fully be able to answer, but trying to 
analogize the situation isn't going to make things any easier to 
explain.  Massives are not raves, yet the 'rave' scene is who ends up 
dealing with their disasters.  I personally am tired of going through 
hell to get a permit for a party, just because some druggies died at a 
kewlworld event, and I'm sure a lot of other people are too.  I 
personally don't think that there is anything inherently wrong with a 
kewlworld type event (hell I've even played at one) but as long as 
stupid people do stupid things at their shows and WE (as in 
real/ug/[your word here] ravers) get the finger pointed at us, people 
will bitch.  Crticicism of koolworld might not exactly be waranted, as 
they aren't the ones that got fucked up and died, but then again 
criticism of the 'rave' scene by the media/authorities isn't waranted 
either, as these deaths didn't even happen at a 'rave'....

As far as massive-attendees criticizing smaller collectives, what 
possibly could they have bad to say about them?  Other than they haven't 
been lucky enough to attend one of their events, I can't imagine anybody 
having anything bad to say about a smallish/UG type party or the crews 
that put them on.  Certainly they aren't going to be complaining about 
how there are deaths now days at every little UG, because that doesn't 
happen.  But for some strange reason it does seem to happen at every big 
show these days...

Keep it Wet & Hard...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Reintroduce ourselves

yeah, yeah, me too...
    I have been partying (raving) for about four years and my first party 
was a Harmony Massive at the 2nd and Jackson venue in Oaktown.  Does anybody 
else remember that party b/c it was off the chain!  I went with DJ 
Drag'nfly, Terry, Shanebo, and bunch of other cool ass cats.  It was the 
moment I stopped ditching school and doing massive amounts of 
self-destructing narcotics.  Raves and the rave community has absolutely 
changed my life for the better.  Some love me and some hate me, and believe 
you me, there are those who do both at the same time.  I go to school at 
SFSU and I turn 21 in a month and a half.  I hope y'all will come out and 
celebrate with a brotha.  Anyway, I guess I'll thrown down a little more 
about me now:  I love electronica.  I started listening to trance, moved 
onto a house phase, and now I am adicted to Jungle, Trance, and House.  I go 
to school at SFSU and I am currently single (wink, wink).  Dancing is my 
drug and love is my philosophy.  Email me if you want to meet up and party 
as a cohesive unit.  Lots of love and little pinch on the butt.  -Trendy 
Mormon Boy, aka Malacai, aka Joe.

>Hippies, techno rebels, candy kids, virtual reality freaks,

Perhaps i'm being anal but words are important to me. 'rebels' reffered to 'house rebels' which was not a "big" part of the rave scene in it's glory days. Techno was the dominant force which pushed it. Now i'm not even into techno anymore so bash away. The point is that these things likes house rebels, candy kids and that sort of crap is what really started to happen when the scene was deteriorating. That''s what we witnessed anyway.  Things get too big, a bandwagon happens. The virtual reality aspect leaves and you're left with "play dough" tables, candy beads and people looking just wearing pants down to their ankles, you know the scene has been over already. I'm not stuck in the past, oh no, but those are facts that happend. 

>insurance salesmen, and everyone else is welcome if they wish to dance in a respectful, peaceful environment.  The term PLUR wasn't around at the time of the Wicked or Moonshine FMRs, but the vibe they represented were IMHO.  Hell, all this is evolutionary...

 

personally i'd like to see a little more reality put back into them but unfortunatly i can only work on myself and not the majority of promoters.

i thought i knew where i was going
i thought i knew where it was
then i started to get tired
then i realized i need a buzz
i looked at the map, before coffee
i found that i might get lost
i wanted to write an excuse note
then i thought, maybe not
maybe i will not wear latex
maybe i will not be late
maybe i might arrive early
but i doubt it at any rate
i just hope that i won't get in trouble
i just hope that i won't fall asleep
and i hope that if i don't make it
that you won't get pissed by my cheap poem, follower:)

John, i can see by your tone of your email that your out to make a point and your point is that Coolworld is a bunch of liers and we shouldnt be believed right?
I can also tell that you PERSONALLY do not like Coolworld so anything you say or feel is going to be slightly biased.
So in short, I answered your concerns below.

I find it amusring that coolworld will come on SFRaves and try to spread
bold-faced lies about DanceSafe, when it's no secret that more than a few
current and ex volunteers read and post, and one currently active DS volunteer
IS a pretty regular SFRaver.

 

---CW---> Coolworld is not spreading bold faced lies and were also very aware that their are members from all parts of the community, not just dance safe. This list is pretty old and i would imagine there is a little of everyone on this forum.



I've been a volunteer with DanceSafe for just over a year and a half now. And
both Alida and Carter are correct. Pill testing is legal. It's controversial,
yes. But it *IS* legal. Coolworld was flat out 100% lieing when they said
otherwise.

 

---CW--> Thats an incorrect statement. Hands Down. You should do more research so that you can furnish actual legality rather then what "you've been told". Again, Coolworld doesnt have to Flat out lie, simply because Coolworld managment has had a tremendous amount of police interaction and has a pretty good understanding of whats legal vs liable vs. moral.



Carter is correct. No volunteer at a DanceSafe table is EVER knowingly in
possetion of a controlled substance. The testing procedure, to which ALL
chapters and volunteers MUST adhere, explicitly states that the pill is
scraped, returned to the raver, and then and ONLY then is the test performed. 
The test destroys the sample. Thus we never knowingly posses ANY drug, real or
fake. ALL chapters and volunteers MUST adhere to this procedure, the whole
point of which is to avoid breaking the law and shield us from liability. If
anyone fails to do so, they are expelled from the organization.

 

---CW--> Although you make a technical statement, the fact of the matter is that law enforcement views that as one of the same thing. Your best bet is to stop calling Coolworld a bunch of liers and Call the DALY CITY Police department yourselves. Then call the cow palace. The you can report back to sfraves and tell us what they told you.



Do you really think that we could exist as an incorperated organization (a
fully certified 501(c)3 non=profit even) if we hadn't consulted with legal
council about this point?

 

---CW--> your existance is based on harm reduction and Coolworld supports that. We offer Dance Safe a Space @ any of our events to had out liteature.



If pill testing were "illegal", as coolworld claims, then why were we
pill-testing out in the open, in full view of the public, and with the full
support of the committee AND the district attorney during ALL of Pride
(including the circuit party) this year? What about at the Castro and Folsom
fairs, again in full view of the public and any patrolling police. What about
at the innumerable other raves where pill testing was allowed. None of this is
in dispute. At Pride, the committee even advretised the pill testing service
for us in the Pride 2002 guide book, and gave us a choice spot in the parade
(yeah... my goofy ass was on TV...)!

 

---CW--> I'm not sure what your circumstances were at pride as Coolworld was not apart of that festivity. I can assure you that we are not allowed to have pill testing at the cow palace, which is a whole other animal.



FACT: DanceSafe has never been alowed to pill-test at a coolworld event
because COOLWORLD refuses to allow it. The buck stops there, nowhere else.

So long as I've been involved with the organization, DanceSafe has only been
allowed into ONE coolworld party, that being LAST year's PNY. And even THEN it
was only due to the incessant and heroic efforts of one of our LOCAL promoters,
with whom coolworld had partnered that time around.

I was one of the volunteers working that one, actually. Though you may not
have seen us. Coolworld stuck us in an obscure corner of one of the secondary
rooms. End even though we were there, all sorts of ridiculous restrictions
were placed on us. For example, we were only allowed to distribute durex brand
condoms (one of our volunteers had to sort through ALL of our free condoms,
picking out and discarding all of the non-durex ones). And pill testing, and
even sales of testing kits, was strictly verboten.

Personally, that experience was the final straw for me (granted, with their
unbroken recored of lies, deciet, and exploitation I didn't exactly have a
positive view of them, even going into that one), guaranteeing that I will
never ever set foot in a coolworld "event" for ANY reason. They just don't care
about anything except extracting every last possible dollar from the rave
scene. And if someone has to die for them to get that dollar, so be it.

It's important to note that this IS my personal opinion tho, not chapter
policy. DS is there for ALL ravers, even those who support coolworld's
actions. And the SF chapter will be wherever there are ravers, *IF* the
promoters ask and/or allow us.

 

---CW--> John, maybe you shouldnt be so quick to judge Coolworld since you really dont know any of the local codes and you have no idea of what were able to perform at the cow palace. Your whole email was based on the liitle bit of knowledge you have and your own personal biased opinions of Coolworld. Even going as far as saying we stuck you in a "Far obscure corner of the building" as if Coolworld has something against dance safe. Please john, thats ridiculous....we have nothing against Dance Safe.

 

--CW--> I would ask people not to distort the facts. Which at this moment there are still very little facts known other then these two young men died of a drug overdose (and that still has to be determined by the toxicology reports). 

 

--CW--> What if these two people died from something else? like GHB? or another drug? then what will you say? Everyone seems to be ASSUMING that these guys died from exstacy which we dont even know? How can we debate what dance safe could of tested if we dont even know what they took? Again, theres ACTUAL DATE and EMOTIONAL DATA. Dont be so quick to judge until you have the facts.

 

respect,

COOLWORLD

Subject: [sfraves] Suggested compromise, if Dance Safe can't conduct pill testing 

--part1_154.19ebc0a9.2b4a35cf_boundary

Hello, I just wanted to suggest that, if Dance Safe is prohibited from 
testing pills at parties, perhaps they could offer some different type of 
literature to distribute. I do feel that they should be able to conduct pill 
testing, but if the venue prohibits it, maybe a new kind of flyer would help 
a little. 

Here's what I'm thinking: in addition to the glossy, informational flyers 
that they distribute, how about a photocopied "cheat sheet" describing the 
pills that have been in recent circulation? Of course there would have to be 
an appropriate disclaimer saying use is not condoned, and there is no 
guarantee that people won't issue counterfeit versions, BUT at least there 
would be a chance to tell people, "Please stay away from the [red / yellow / 
blue] 'whatevers' -- they're a mix of MDA and ketamine and don't even contain 
any MDMA."
Tell the parents, this isn't very different from Wavy Gravy at Woodstock, 
warning the kids that there was a lot of bad brown acid around. "And if 
you're going to take it, just have half a tab."  
I think that if the word gets around that a certain pill is bad, it stops 
showing up. That's what happened a few years back when those DXM Green 
Triangles were around. Dance Safe publicized how bad they were, and they went 
away. 

So, if it just isn't possible to have testing at  a party, I think Dance Safe 
should at least be able to give out info saying which are the bad pills. They 
could show people color printouts and then partiers could just see for 
themselves, without the potential legal issues of actual testing. Maybe a 
whiteboard, like they had at the Megga Buzz campout, that described what was 
around and whether it was bunk.

I hope my ideas have some potential for increasing public health & safety 
without increasing anybody's liability.

[As Cool World points out, we don't even know if pills have anything to do 
with the two unfortunate deaths at Planet NY. I've heard ER doctors say that 
complications due to e alone are fairly rare; GHB and/or alcohol are often 
involved, though. On New Year's Eve, I would not be surprised if people mix 
alcohol with drugs.  Please be safe, everyone.]

Look, you've obviously repeated your little "pill testing is illegal" lie
enough times that even you believe it.  But that doesn't make it true.

Frankly, I don't care what you think the cops say.  I actually HAVE talked to a
LAWYER on the issue, and been informed that, yes, it IS legal for me to test
someone's pill via the DanceSafe procedure.  You know the difference between a
cop and a lawyer, yes?  One is a knuckle-dragger mostly concerned with beating
non-white people over the head, and believes that the "law" is whatever strikes
its whimsey that day.  The other is a professional who spends the better part
of a decade learning the actual LAW inside and out, and is rigorously tested on
the facts before being allowed by the Bar Asscoiation before being allowed to
practice.

And yes, when I did consult, I WAS told that what I was doing was legal and
that the chances that I'd EVER be prosecuted were so miniscule that I could
mostly ignore them.  And that if anybody ever DID try to prosecute, any
competent defence attorney could get any charges dropped almost instantly.  I
see no reason at all why said advice wouldn't apply to EVERY DanceSafe
volunteer.

So, either my old lawyer (who can be censured, disbarred, or even prosecuted if
proven to have given deceptive council) is a liar; or you (who has no
accountability, and a record as the most exploitave promoter in the scene, with
a years-long string of lies) is.  I wonder whom?

As for Pride, even WE were concerned that pill-testing might not go over so
well.  But we were invited by the Pride committee with the specific request
that pill-testing be done.  When we voiced our concerns, the committee brought
the issue to the districe attorney, Terence Hallinan (you know... the guy who
would be prosecuting any DanceSafe volunteer if pill-testing WERE, as you
claim, illegal.  Mr. Hallinan, at the behest of the Pride committee, actually
took the step of contacting US, and assuring us that pill-testing *IS* legal,
that the government fully supports harm reduction, and that none of us, NOR
anyone who came to have their pills tested, would be prosecuted.  We had this
in a written statemwnt that we posted at the booth for all to see.

So, I can take the word of both my old lawyer AND the district attorney; or I
can believe coolworld.  Hmmmm...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] PNY03 Aftermath & Re-cap...

Well... you may have a point that I shouldn't have injected so much of my
personal opinion into my first post on that topic.   But deliberately spreading
falsehood and lies is one of the most loathesome and contemptable things I can
think of.  And coolworld was trying to tarnish the reputation, by lieing about
us, of an organization of which I am quite fond, and which I believe does very
positive and helpful work.

Fact is:  I caught coolworld in a lie, and I called them on it.

And if you go through the archives of SFRaves, you'll find me doing the very
same thing on a variety of topics, from stuff drug related (like heroin in
pills) to technical issues (what sort of kernel Mac OS X is built upon).  Whan
I've caught people spreading lies on topics with which I am familiar, I've
slapped them down.

Sometimes, yes, maybe I've been too harsh.  On at least a couple of occasions I
was so harsh that I felt bad about it and apologised later.  But seperating out
the emotions, I still don't think that any apology was really called for. 
Maybe it's just a pet peeve of mine.  It's hard as hell for me to hold a grudge
and take most things personallt.  And a lot of things are easy for me to
forgive.  But lies and deciet are not among them.

I'll go ahead and quit posting on the PNY topics.  If coolworld wants to have
the last word they're welcome to it.  All I ask now, is that people check the
facts before believing any more lies that they try to spread.  Everything I
have said wrt/ DanceSafe is fully public information that you could get either
from our public websites, or by having observed the booths (especially the one
at Pride) in the past.


cya,
john

Look, you've obviously repeated your little "pill testing is illegal" lie<BR>

<BR>
Frankly, I don't care what you think the cops say.&nbsp; I actually HAVE talked to a<BR>
LAWYER on the issue, and been informed that, yes, it IS legal for me to test<BR>
someone's pill via the DanceSafe procedure.&nbsp; You know the difference between a<BR>
cop and a lawyer, yes?&nbsp; One is a knuckle-dragger mostly concerned with beating<BR>
non-white people over the head, and believes that the "law" is whatever strikes<BR>
its whimsey that day.&nbsp; The other is a professional who spends the better part<BR>
of a decade learning the actual LAW inside and out, and is rigorously tested on<BR>
the facts before being allowed by the Bar Asscoiation before being allowed to<BR>
practice.<BR>
<BR>
And yes, when I did consult, I WAS told that what I was doing was legal and<BR>
that the chances that I'd EVER be prosecuted were so miniscule that I could<BR>
mostly ignore them.&nbsp; And that if anybody ever DID try to prosecute, any<BR>

<BR>
So, either my old lawyer (who can be censured, disbarred, or even prosecuted if<BR>
proven to have given deceptive council) is a liar; or you (who has no<BR>
accountability, and a record as the most exploitave promoter in the scene, with<BR>
a years-long string of lies) is.&nbsp; I wonder whom?<BR>
<BR>
As for Pride, even WE were concerned that pill-testing might not go over so<BR>
well.&nbsp; But we were invited by the Pride committee with the specific request<BR>
that pill-testing be done.&nbsp; When we voiced our concerns, the committee brought<BR>
the issue to the districe attorney, Terence Hallinan (you know... the guy who<BR>
would be prosecuting any DanceSafe volunteer if pill-testing WERE, as you<BR>
claim, illegal.&nbsp; Mr. Hallinan, at the behest of the Pride committee, actually<BR>
took the step of contacting US, and assuring us that pill-testing *IS* legal,<BR>
that the government fully supports harm reduction, and that none of us, NOR<BR>
anyone who came to have their pills tested, would be prosecuted.&nbsp; We had this<BR>
in a written statemwnt that we posted at the booth for all to see.<BR>
<BR>
So, I can take the word of both my old lawyer AND the district attorney; or I<BR>
can believe coolworld.&nbsp; Hmmmm...<BR>

&gt;---CW---&gt; Coolworld is not spreading bold faced lies and were also very aware<BR>

&gt;This list is pretty old and i would imagine there is a little of everyone on<BR>
&gt;this forum.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I've been a volunteer with DanceSafe for just over a year and a half now. And<BR>
&gt;both Alida and Carter are correct. Pill testing is legal. It's controversial,<BR>
&gt;yes. But it *IS* legal. Coolworld was flat out 100% lieing when they said<BR>
&gt;otherwise.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;---CW--&gt; Thats an incorrect statement. Hands Down. You should do more<BR>
&gt;research so that you can furnish actual legality rather then what "you've<BR>
&gt;been told". Again, Coolworld doesnt have to Flat out lie, simply because<BR>
&gt;Coolworld managment has had a tremendous amount of police interaction and has<BR>
&gt;a pretty good understanding of whats legal vs liable vs. moral.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Carter is correct. No volunteer at a DanceSafe table is EVER knowingly in<BR>
&gt;possetion of a controlled substance. The testing procedure, to which ALL<BR>
&gt;chapters and volunteers MUST adhere, explicitly states that the pill is<BR>
&gt;scraped, returned to the raver, and then and ONLY then is the test performed.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The test destroys the sample. Thus we never knowingly posses ANY drug, real<BR>
&gt;or<BR>
&gt;fake. ALL chapters and volunteers MUST adhere to this procedure, the whole<BR>
&gt;point of which is to avoid breaking the law and shield us from liability. If<BR>
&gt;anyone fails to do so, they are expelled from the organization.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;---CW--&gt; Although you make a technical statement, the fact of the matter is<BR>
&gt;that law enforcement views that as one of the same thing. Your best bet is to<BR>
&gt;stop calling Coolworld a bunch of liers and Call the DALY CITY Police<BR>
&gt;department yourselves. Then call the cow palace. The you can report back to<BR>
&gt;sfraves and tell us what they told you.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Do you really think that we could exist as an incorperated organization (a<BR>
&gt;fully certified 501(c)3 non=profit even) if we hadn't consulted with legal<BR>
&gt;council about this point?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;---CW--&gt; your existance is based on harm reduction and Coolworld supports<BR>
&gt;that. We offer Dance Safe a Space @ any of our events to had out liteature.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;If pill testing were "illegal", as coolworld claims, then why were we<BR>
&gt;pill-testing out in the open, in full view of the public, and with the full<BR>
&gt;support of the committee AND the district attorney during ALL of Pride<BR>
&gt;(including the circuit party) this year? What about at the Castro and Folsom<BR>
&gt;fairs, again in full view of the public and any patrolling police. What about<BR>
&gt;at the innumerable other raves where pill testing was allowed. None of this<BR>
&gt;is<BR>
&gt;in dispute. At Pride, the committee even advretised the pill testing service<BR>
&gt;for us in the Pride 2002 guide book, and gave us a choice spot in the parade<BR>
&gt;(yeah... my goofy ass was on TV...)!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;---CW--&gt; I'm not sure what your circumstances were at pride as Coolworld was<BR>
&gt;not apart of that festivity. I can assure you that we are not allowed to have<BR>
&gt;pill testing at the cow palace, which is a whole other animal.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;FACT: DanceSafe has never been alowed to pill-test at a coolworld event<BR>
&gt;because COOLWORLD refuses to allow it. The buck stops there, nowhere else.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;So long as I've been involved with the organization, DanceSafe has only been<BR>
&gt;allowed into ONE coolworld party, that being LAST year's PNY. And even THEN<BR>
&gt;it<BR>
&gt;was only due to the incessant and heroic efforts of one of our LOCAL<BR>
&gt;promoters,<BR>
&gt;with whom coolworld had partnered that time around.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I was one of the volunteers working that one, actually. Though you may not<BR>
&gt;have seen us. Coolworld stuck us in an obscure corner of one of the secondary<BR>
&gt;rooms. End even though we were there, all sorts of ridiculous restrictions<BR>
&gt;were placed on us. For example, we were only allowed to distribute durex<BR>
&gt;brand<BR>
&gt;condoms (one of our volunteers had to sort through ALL of our free condoms,<BR>
&gt;picking out and discarding all of the non-durex ones). And pill testing, and<BR>
&gt;even sales of testing kits, was strictly verboten.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Personally, that experience was the final straw for me (granted, with their<BR>
&gt;unbroken recored of lies, deciet, and exploitation I didn't exactly have a<BR>
&gt;positive view of them, even going into that one), guaranteeing that I will<BR>
&gt;never ever set foot in a coolworld "event" for ANY reason. They just don't<BR>
&gt;care<BR>
&gt;about anything except extracting every last possible dollar from the rave<BR>
&gt;scene. And if someone has to die for them to get that dollar, so be it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;It's important to note that this IS my personal opinion tho, not chapter<BR>
&gt;policy. DS is there for ALL ravers, even those who support coolworld's<BR>
&gt;actions. And the SF chapter will be wherever there are ravers, *IF* the<BR>
&gt;promoters ask and/or allow us.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;---CW--&gt; John, maybe you shouldnt be so quick to judge Coolworld since you<BR>
&gt;really dont know any of the local codes and you have no idea of what were<BR>
&gt;able to perform at the cow palace. Your whole email was based on the liitle<BR>
&gt;bit of knowledge you have and your own personal biased opinions of Coolworld.<BR>
&gt;Even going as far as saying we stuck you in a "Far obscure corner of the<BR>
&gt;building" as if Coolworld has something against dance safe. Please john,<BR>
&gt;thats ridiculous....we have nothing against Dance Safe.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;--CW--&gt; I would ask people not to distort the facts. Which at this moment<BR>
&gt;there are still very little facts known other then these two young men died<BR>
&gt;of a drug overdose (and that still has to be determined by the toxicology<BR>
&gt;reports). <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;--CW--&gt; What if these two people died from something else? like GHB? or<BR>
&gt;another drug? then what will you say? Everyone seems to be ASSUMING that<BR>
&gt;these guys died from exstacy which we dont even know? How can we debate what<BR>
&gt;dance safe could of tested if we dont even know what they took? Again, theres<BR>

Subject: [sfraves] dancesafe and [sfraves] PNY03 Aftermath & Re-cap...

I have talked to a narcotics office about this subject in depth. And
after the debate went on and on, this is what I gathered. 


-testing the pill is not illegal. But taking the pill and then giving it
back is. Basically, he said, dancefsafe is giving the pill back, and
that is what is putting them in violation. 

"if you handed the gun to the bank robber as he walked into the bank,
after the bank is robbed, would you be an assessory?"

Basically to have a pill is illegal. To distribute is illegal. And those
two are needed to test the drug. Also possession of mdma does not have a
minimum amount, so that little amount would be seen as possession in the
eyes of an officer. 


And when I brought up the argument about dirty needle trading and how
the government allows that. He brought up the fact that those laws were
passed due to an obvious epidemic. And that when deaths to dirty club
drugs reaches epidemic levels, it would make it easier to pass similar
laws. But that just fuels the law enforcement stance to shut down the
arenas used to take these potentially dirty drugs. So we an in turn,
shooting ourselves in the foot by wanting to have pill testing for bad
illegal drugs while trying to have parties that aren't about the drugs,
which is illegal. 



That was at least a narcotics officers standpoint.

And you keep coming back to confront them about it, but that doesn't mean 
you are any more correct.  Pill testing may or may not be illegal, but the 
issue is, Coolworld isn't allowed to have pill testing going on at their 
event, and this comes from the local police and venue owners.  Until you 
have notarized statements from both the police and the venue owners, STFU!

You'd hold a lawyer above a cop?  I don't like Pigs myself, but I'd never 
insult a cop by making such an insinuation.  At least cops are honest 
pricks.  Furthermore, a lawyer is going to help you in court.  after you 
get arrested.  after the event gets shut down.  CW is trying to avoid that 
happening in the first place, and I applaud their logic.  It makes sense.

ROFLMAO.  Yeah John, I'm sure everyone believes you're unbiased and 
truthful.  Excuse me while I go laugh some more.

He's the DA of San Francisco, not Daly City.  You never answered my 
question: was the Pride parade a restricted event?  Were participants 
searched, or have to pay to get in?  You're comparing apples to 
trucks.  Face it, you don't have all the facts about the event, and using a 
different event in a different city is not evidence of a lie.

Subject: [sfraves] legal / illegal... doesn't matter!!!  Re: [sfraves] PNY03 Aftermath & Re-cap...

The way i see all this is quite simple...

Regardless of whether or not Pill Testing is legal or illegal, if the venue
owner says no pill testing, then there will be no pill testing [period]!

it's that simple...

if you straight up go against what the venue owner says i am sure they would
shut it down down mid-stream... i mean, what kind of venue owner would NOT
put something like this in the Contract? and if YOU break the contract
first, you cannot sue them for shutting the event down early...

John, although i enjoyed reading this whole topic (as well as thought it to
be quite informative), i think that you wasted a whole lot of time and
breath trying to show your views... sure maybe you pointed out that pill
testing may be legal and that coolworld may be liars... but does it really
matter? when it comes down to renting a space and getting permits, you have
to abide by what the Rental Agreement / Contract says, otherwise, your event
will most certainly get shut down...

does this make sense?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A New Year, Let's Re-Introduce Everyone On the List That Posts.

Scan. Well.

I'm Sean. I was born in SoCal and was a properly sheltered youth, marred only by
internet access and a library card. I've lived in the bay area for a net 2 1/2
years, by my estimate, but I can't be sure -- I've moved around. A lot. Spent
most of my childhood moving around with family, then got the travel bug at 17,
during my 2nd year at COM. Fucked up royally, dropped out, and hit the road for
the following ~3 years.

My interest in electronic music is pretty new, all things considered. My ear was
drawn away from a steady diet of prepackaged 'rock' by experimental 'electronic'
music, noise, and a steady diet of the ilk of Skinny Puppy and Aphex twin.

I got pushed in the direction of grooveradio back when they were still on the
air, and my interest in EDM began there. Never did dig the reggae, though.

I went to my first party in Texas, no more than 10 months ago. Having already
developed a healthy sphincter-clench in response to clubs (especially the almost
antirave atmosphere of so many goth clubs), I was doing a variety of things I
oughtn't have, and got invited to some parties thrown by the DigDug Underground
in Dallas. The Levy got my attention, the music got my soul, the peeps got my
love, and the drugs ... well. 
 
Well.

Peace. -_^

Subject: Re: [sfraves] anyone go to Tribal souls?

I did, it was pretty fun but we left about four b/c the DJ who came was 
trying to do some "weird stuff (how ambigous, but I can't really describe it 
any other way. sorry)" and wasn't really workin' for him.  The only problem 
with the Tribal Souls party is that venue gets really hot, also there were a 
lot of people just standing in front of the DJ table (that's my pet peeve!). 
  The crowd on the whole was good and think that the majority of the people 
were sober also.  Overall, I give it 7 out of 10.

  Wow, I think someone needs to calm down and work on their anger managment issues. ; )
 "John B." <svnlyrbrto@yahoo.com> wrote:Look, you've obviously repeated your little "pill testing is illegal" lie
enough times that even you believe it. But that doesn't make it true.

Frankly, I don't care what you think the cops say. I actually HAVE talked to a
LAWYER on the issue, and been informed that, yes, it IS legal for me to test
someone's pill via the DanceSafe procedure. You know the difference between a
cop and a lawyer, yes? One is a knuckle-dragger mostly concerned with beating
non-white people over the head, and believes that the "law" is whatever strikes
its whimsey that day. The other is a professional who spends the better part
of a decade learning the actual LAW inside and out, and is rigorously tested on
the facts before being allowed by the Bar Asscoiation before being allowed to
practice.

And yes, when I did consult, I WAS told that what I was doing was legal and
that the chances that I'd EVER be prosecuted were so miniscule that I could
mostly ignore them. And that if anybody ever DID try to prosecute, any
competent defence attorney could get any charges dropped almost instantly. I
see no reason at all why said advice wouldn't apply to EVERY DanceSafe
volunteer.

So, either my old lawyer (who can be censured, disbarred, or even prosecuted if
proven to have given deceptive council) is a liar; or you (who has no
accountability, and a record as the most exploitave promoter in the scene, with
a years-long string of lies) is. I wonder whom?

As for Pride, even WE were concerned that pill-testing might not go over so
well. But we were invited by the Pride committee with the specific request
that pill-testing be done. When we voiced our concerns, the committee brought
the issue to the districe attorney, Terence Hallinan (you know... the guy who
would be prosecuting any DanceSafe volunteer if pill-testing WERE, as you
claim, illegal. Mr. Hallinan, at the behest of the Pride committee, actually
took the step of contacting US, and assuring us that pill-testing *IS* legal,
that the government fully supports harm reduction, and that none of us, NOR
anyone who came to have their pills tested, would be prosecuted. We had this
in a written statemwnt that we posted at the booth for all to see.

So, I can take the word of both my old lawyer AND the district attorney; or I
can believe coolworld. Hmmmm...

Again, John.....take some time and calm your nerves. This isn't a court of law and you didn't catch Coolworld in a "LIE". 
You have your belief's based on what your lawyer told you and we have our belief's based on what several law enforcement agencies have conveyed to us. 
Quit trying to make this a Coolworld vs. Dancesafe debate, as Coolworld doesn't even have anything against Dancesafe. This would be obvious since your representatives were @ PNY03 passing out condoms. 
Your eagerness to slander Coolworld and call us liars makes me wonder what your real intentions are here? Do you want to bad mouth us John? cause thats old... 
Quit jumping to conclusions and calling us liars. Your perspective on the law and cops is completely twisted as your analogy that all cops beat people is completely wrong. 
Many of us have law enforcement as family, friends, and aquantances and i would assure that not all law enforcement is corrupt or bad. 
If your interested in having a constructive conversation i would be happy to go offline and discuss this with you further. 
Regards, 
Coolworld

personal opinion into my first post on that topic. But deliberately spreading
falsehood and lies is one of the most loathesome and contemptable things I can
think of. And coolworld was trying to tarnish the reputation, by lieing about
us, of an organization of which I am quite fond, and which I believe does very
positive and helpful work.

Fact is: I caught coolworld in a lie, and I called them on it.

And if you go through the archives of SFRaves, you'll find me doing the very
same thing on a variety of topics, from stuff drug related (like heroin in
pills) to technical issues (what sort of kernel Mac OS X is built upon). Whan
I've caught people spreading lies on topics with which I am familiar, I've
slapped them down.

Sometimes, yes, maybe I've been too harsh. On at least a couple of occasions I
was so harsh that I felt bad about it and apologised later. But seperating out
the emotions, I still don't think that any apology was really called for. 
Maybe it's just a pet peeve of mine. It's hard as hell for me to hold a grudge
and take most things personallt. And a lot of things are easy for me to
forgive. But lies and deciet are not among them.

I'll go ahead and quit posting on the PNY topics. If coolworld wants to have
the last word they're welcome to it. All I ask now, is that people check the
facts before believing any more lies that they try to spread. Everything I
have said wrt/ DanceSafe is fully public information that you could get either
from our public websites, or by having observed the booths (especially the one
at Pride) in the past.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A New Year, Let's Re-Introduce Everyone On the List That Posts.

Sounds good. I have lived for the most part on & off(~4 years?) in good old 
Chico. Jumped headalong into the raving world very recently, October 18th 
2002 to be precise with the wue and then the eta neotokyo party the next 
day.
I simply love dancing in all its different forms; it all started with 
ballroom, moving on to clubbing, the irish step and now raving.(what can I 
say, the new york street hustle goes smooothly with most electronic music :) 
My march continues to learn newer dance forms and mix them all up.
Besides that, I am very passionate about the outdoors. I spent all my summer 
mountaineering in the Range of light(the sierra nevadas).
Let's see what else, I have this big fascination with celtic culture, I have 
taken up playing the celtic fiddle, I love meeting people, art/independent 
movies, writing, english literature, etc.
Having worked in the bay for a year before getting laid off, I have to say 
work life sucks for me. I've met more people going to school. When I try 
visualizing my future, I see "TRAVEL all over the world" splashed in big 
green letters:)
Meeting people from this list? I've met a couple, would love to meet more. 
Yes, I did add my profile to the site.
Oh yeah, my name is Vishal.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A New Year, Let's Re-Introduce Everyone On the List That Posts.

hi, i'm nic i'm a pisces/dragaon, (which means i blow steam), i'm 38 and,
since Apollo has posted elsewhere that his dancing/ravin' career started @
Woodstock, mine began on  May Day, 1979, when I split from parents home and
attended my first cannabis smoke-in in NYC's Washington Square Park,
followed by my first Rock Against Racism concert @ the Bandshell in Central
Park.

I hooked up with the organizers of those events that very day, moved in with
them, and I'd like to say I never looked back, but I did, by moving back to
my parents home every now and then.

Prolly one of the dumber decisions I ever made, but oh well.

But my focus was with these good people and I lived with them on and off for
a three year period, @ 9 and 10 Bleecker Street in NYC, at what is now the
current World Headquarters for the http://www.cures-not-wars.org/ these are
the same people who are doing some cutting edge work in the field of
'addiction interruption' by dissemenating information they have compiled
over the last few years on the use of the psychedelic plant, ibogaine.

They've just been written up in JAMA, which is major huge.

Turns out, that while we were partying across the street they were busy
putting this work together.

Who knew?

Additionally, they are one of the major forces in America today for the
repeal of Cannabis Prohibition that we are currently suffering under in this
country.

'The Million Marijuania March" this coming May 3rd is also them.

Why I say my raving career began there is, while 9 Bleecker Street was the
office space, #10 was actually:

'Studio 10'

a live work space that we held parties in at least 3 nights a week, much
like today's UG's for a period of a few years, it was hella fun, but the
space was lost in a landlord tenant dispute, and so it goes.

I was young then and dinn't know that this was something I wanted to pursue,
so in a word, I went straight for over a decade, did college, enlisted in
the service, worked on Wall Street and SF's Financial District and
essentially never went out, save to Clubland, from time to time.

The closest i came to a rave was hearing B.A.D. mention raves in a song of
theirs almost 12 years ago, and I kinda knew something was up, because the
line was:

'It's one am, let's go out to a rave...'

Everyone knows that at that time things are *closing* not starting, so my
interest was piqued, but I dinn't follow-up on it, since my focus was on
that brass ring thing, which in the end left me broke, physically injured
with a mild chronic upper back problem, and more trouble than you can shake
a stick at.

As you can imagine, I was pretty unhappy with all this.

Some other things came up, I moved to Silicon Valley, and it still didn't
dawn on me that there was/is another way.

In 1998, i hooked up w/some people, rediscovered my love of music through
them and attended my first local party in November, on Friday the 13th, were
we coming from the first house party I had ever thrown.

The party we went to was crewed by the Enchanted Broccoli Forest people and
they had taken over a space 100 times larger than Studio 10.

I was the guy in the Marine Corps Dress Blue uniform costume, in case anyone
here remembers that party.

Was struck by a couple things right off the bat.

#1 Dinn't see any alcohol being served
#2 A chill room, which changes everything, cuz the last thing clubs want you
to do is sit still, think, and not not buy alcohol
#3 People seemed pretty happy
#4 Every other damned raver in there was wearing those red blinky LED's
incorporated into jewelry, which was kinda irksome because my Dad held a
patent on those LED's and actually tried to market them as jewelry in the
late 1970's, I'm just glad i was able to tell him about it before he passed
away, he thought it was hella cool.

>From that point on, I'd like to say raving became my life, but alas and
alack that was not the case, if anything my involvement has been glacial, it
was another 6 months before I even subbed here on sfraves.

For the last two years i wanted to step up my involvement past posting on
this list, but I made a few decisions around work and my personal life that
impeded that goal, so i only got to go to a few parties in that period, and
i'm just now only starting to catch on to EDM.

Having a g/f with hundreds of CD's and thousands upon thousands of vinyl
records in the basement *really* helps, and it doesn't hurt that she's been
going out to parties for years, as a matter of fact we met on another list,
so yeah, she's a raver babe, lucky me.

that, and through her, i'm beginning to puzzle out the differences between
genres, Ishkur helped a bit, but there's nothing like being taught one to
one.

we don't have any decks yet, since we can't afford them yet, the move was
costly, since I'm now clear across the country in DC, which, surprise,
surprise, also has a bright and vibrant scene, which some say may be on par
with the Bay Area's, though UG's are a lil way off, but there is some
cross-pollination and some locals have recently visited the Bay Area and are
looking to start some of their own.

I've been to more parties in the two months that i've been here than i have
in the last two years, and before I left the Bay Area, DJ Jack Triumph asked
me to try my hand at promoting him and I'd be remiss without mentioning his
site, www.JackTriumph.com and letting you know you can DL his breakthrough
release :

"Rome Rebuilt - The Studio Sessions,"

as well as his latest:

"Paganism,"

from the site's DL page, enjoy, it's pretty thumping.

Also, SiliconSalon.com is in the middle of a DNS transfer as we speak.

My original concept was something along the lines of what www.hyperreal.org
was already doing, but I dinn't even know they existed when i founded it in
1997 and they had like a 5 year headstart on me, and my focus ended up being
more on the goings on in Silicon Valley, as it turned out, but I'm switching
gears and am going to focus on rave and EDM culture, as well as host of
other topics and am looking for raver fellow travellers to work with with
this, i'll kepp you posted as this process moves further along....

Apollo, any chance we can mirror your House Music 101History Book?

We'd love to have you contribute, if you don't mind.

I got a great deal on the hosting from another raver on a local list here
who runs www.epitomized.com and I promised him to refer people by word of
mouth, so I just did.

So, yeah, I'm a raver, and i'm not going anywhere, and look forward to a
long and healthy future in 'the scene' as it were, and where it will take me
I don't know, tho' i don't see any downside to keeping my nose clean, my
head straight and going out and dancing, dancing, dancing the night away.

As the Eminem sez, it's good to be back.....

nic

hi all,

name is angelica. i guess at my age i'd be considered old skool. first massive was in 91, here in the sf bay. 

grew up in modesto, moved to sf in 99.

i am one of the original members of the sflnc, celebrating over 3 years of service to dance culture. still serving as grassroots co-chairperson.

i haven't posted much in the past but i do enjoy reading the conversations. i enjoy the more community oriantated post, and try and laugh at some of the silly, or mean shit posted.

as a member of dance culture i am proud to have worked in some capacity, to preserve, protect and promote dance culture. i am saddened by the recent events at PNY, but it's incidents like that, that have discouraged me from attending massives anymore.....

at 31, i just can't stand to see the over-indulgence of some people. i hate to admit it, but i feel like some mom figure or something. yet i realize it's part of the individual experience to explore. like when someone says "don't touch it's hot", yet we find some need to get burned to feel the heat.....

i certainly, am not trying to come across as some old fuddy duddy house head who doesn't like to boogie or participate in extra curricular activities, i just know my personal limits. i guess my issues with drug addiction play a part in why i feel the way i do. both my brother (27) and my father are addicted to heroin, i just don't understand the over indulgence and enjoyment of being so intoxicated you can't even take care of yourself.

which is why i like 21+ parties. yes, there are peeps at every age who make it rough for other along with themselves, but the chances of a 25 year old loosing control vs an inexperienced 16, is less.

i have tried in the past to understand the younger members of dance culture as they must share some of the same experiences i did in my early raver days, but back in the day, you didn't have so many choices to make, k,e, 2cb, coke, speed bla bla bla....

so i can see how a sea of choices can be hard to navigate.....i worked with the dance safe national office and the local chapter last year, but found there wasn't much support for education. yes, people like what dancesafe does, but do many volunteer, donate money, invite them to table at a party? get to the JUST SAY KNOW...in stead of just say no?

drugs have taken the life of my father, my brother and many other relationships in my life....it's hard for me to see drugs the focus of our culture....

dance culture is more than the boogie, drugs or even the music....it's about the fellowship+ing and comeraderie we share....and the music is MY guide.

i just wish we could find the happily ever after....

thanks for letting me post me .02. i am not trying to debate any issue with anyone. just opening up and letting it out....

no judgments please....

i believe protecting dance culture is about our civil rights....

our right to choose!!

i'm looking forward to participating in more conversations!!!!!





the rumor is love,
the word is peace,

start a rumor!
spread the word!!

Okay it's this fucking simple....

Coolworld or ANY other dance event production company cannot hold an event 
at the Cow Palace and allow pill testing.   Allowing dancesafe to pill test 
isn't a decision coolworld can make -   IT SIMPLY IS NOT AN OPTION.  Get it 
though your head yet????

YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE CAUSE OF DEATH -  Frankly the odds are VERY high 
that it was NOT caused by ecstasy.   So unless dancesafe starts testing 
GHB, Special K, Herion and every other drug out there, shut your mouth 
until the official results are out.

Some of you people make me sick.   Two people are dead and you are 
obsessing over pointing fingers.   Why the hell would you want to blame 
someones death on someone else when it was completely out of their 
control?   Have some fucking respect!!  Playing the 'blame game' over 
peoples lives is DISGUSTING.

I hope everyone takes the time to check this event out.  What's most 
appealing is the live performance by Tycho.  He's a trip hop artist radically 
different than anything out there, and he's gonna do it Live. Real Live 
Electronic Trip Hop.  Heads up when anyone does live acts...

Dominic, you'll also be surprised to find out that TYCHO will be playing one of the hardest sets he's ever put together as well...a great introduction into his style along all the brilliant Trance, Techno, NRG, and Happycore djs as well.
Best wishes and see you there

--0-1353852101-1041891330=:37308
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


hi....

i should have introduced myself before posting, i know. i just usually lurk. nothing has caught my attention much till this thread.....

i am one of the original memebrs of the SFLNC, also worked in the dancesafe national office before all the drama....that's what i have given to dance culture. my first massive was in 91. my first "session" was in 91. i consider myself old skool....at 30, i have scene our culture evolve, a lot. i moved from modesto, ca three years ago, gave up a carrer in selling new homes to move to sf and DO SOMETHING, do something to stop the misconceptions regarding dance culture. .....enough of my background.

dance culture means so much to me. the most important people in my life i met on the dance floor. the fellowshiping and the comeraderie of everyone comming to gether and sharing themselves, thier energy theyre being. it's amazing, it's what we all yearn for....frinedships, love, understanding tolleramnce.....it's all there if you look for it. thats what i see when i see the dance floor. it's what i give when i am dancing.....

it upsets me when the media or the powers that be try and define dance culture by candy ravers or by glowsticks....(no offense to either, i used to love both but i'm 30 now)....... ;)
we are memebrs of the general populas and we should be respected for being adults who make adult descions. i can't speak for the under 18 crowd cause i haven't been under age for so long....but for us adults who can vote, we can do something. the underground is special because you are more free to do as you wish.....the club scenen is much different because you have to "follow" the rules. which i don't mind, but trying to criminalize our culture by defining it by drugs or unresponsible behavoir is just wrong. which is why i tried to help out with dancesafe, now known as the share project. I feel that our cicil liberties are challanged when permits are hard to get our parties are shut down for permitting issues.

 

i am interested in knowing and undertsanding what others are doing to help the scene. i have recently lost some of my inspiration to promote, protect and preserve after hours dance culture. 





the rumor is love,
the word is peace,

start a rumor!
spread the word!!

Hey man, I have no problems with spelling whatsoever. People should
understand that it's my incorrect use of homonym's and ignorant overuse of
apostrophe's that should be getting on there nerve's.

I'm putting in a vote for PMA.  Whatever it was, was nasty and I don't
think the people who suffered knew each other so it meant someone shady
was out there giving people tickets one way down.  Disgusting.

Okay it's this fucking simple....

Coolworld or ANY other dance event production company cannot hold an
event 
at the Cow Palace and allow pill testing.   Allowing dancesafe to pill
test 
isn't a decision coolworld can make -   IT SIMPLY IS NOT AN OPTION.  Get
it 
though your head yet????

YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE CAUSE OF DEATH -  Frankly the odds are VERY high

that it was NOT caused by ecstasy.   So unless dancesafe starts testing 
GHB, Special K, Herion and every other drug out there, shut your mouth 
until the official results are out.

Some of you people make me sick.   Two people are dead and you are 
obsessing over pointing fingers.   Why the hell would you want to blame 
someones death on someone else when it was completely out of their 
control?   Have some fucking respect!!  Playing the 'blame game' over 
peoples lives is DISGUSTING.

Why are you so upset about this? You place a post about spelling; people bag 
on it. And now you place another post. Dude, this is a dance/rave mailing 
list. Who cares who posts what; You do have the choice of whether or not you 
want to read it.

If your looking for proper grammer, may I suggest

news.alt.newsweek.com

Nothing against you; but, there is no reason to post asking people to 
spellcheck. Man, and I thought I had OCD.

Assumptions get you into trouble. I'd venture to say this list is comprised
of a much older crowd than the past few years. Mistyping a word while
bagging on fast typing errors of others kills your argument. I have pulled
similar red faced posts like this. Laugh and learn. =)

What's age is a *youngster* these days?

How many times in a row are you going to misspell a word and continue to bag
on what most often is a :: typing :: error.

?? "isin't" ??

Is this list that much a thorn in your side? Figure out what's really
bothering you instead of getting upset over trivial matters like typos.

Subject: [sfraves] sfr 10 year anniversary pics

i reformatted my hard drive and wiped out everything and burned all of my
photographs (from the last three years) onto a cd..
and i'm a dumbass because i didn't burn the photographs, i burned links to
the photographs..

anyway, i lost three years worth of photographs. doh!
but luckily, the sfr 10 year party was on a back up cd i burned a few months
ago..

so here you go (never too late!), a few pics:

sometimes, i am too tired to write poetry in long thin lines that curve and wrap and make words seem like symmetry and more than letters in strings

sometimes the writing is better for you than for me 

and 

sometimes, sometimes

the writing is all for me and you are only there for you and you alone :)

Forgive me if I am interpreting your comments incorrectly, but why do you 
have to bring Sacraves into this? With all these rave lists there are 
moments when I cringe in embarrassment at the content in terms of exhibiting 
courtesy, maturity, and respect.  No need to take a cheap shot at Sacraves.

Well said, hey I can attest to that. CJ didnt move the tiniest barring the

making emeralds drop like hail from the speakers! (ok sorry bad metaphor)
I have a pic to prove that:)

Bwahahah- others have already pointed out the hypocracy of your
"fourm"-
Might I also point out your improper capitalization and dubious comma
usage?
But really who gives a fuck?
I hate spell checkers.
You think I've got the time to go back and review every single typing
mistake I kame?
See?
Just like that- my fingers move in a different order than my mind
does.
I just mistyped "make" as "kame".
Whoopty shit- what kind of life do you lead where worrying about
spelling on SFR is an issue for you?

Subject: [sfraves] Missing Record Box!  (Last seen Friday night in the Mission)


My good friend is missing a record box containing approximately 60 records.  
The last place it was seen was on the sidewalk outside of Amnesia 
(Valencia/20th) in the Mission, after closing.  If anyone stumbled upon the 
box or knows of anyone who has recently discovered a multi-colored record 
box containing mostly house records, please contact me as soon as you can so 
that we can try to get the stuff back to its rightful owner.

Thank you very much for reading!  Our fingers are crossed that someone will 
do the right thing.

-Ken

Dustin,
Don't blame youth for a comical reaction to YOUR screwup!  Just how old are you, Mr. Mature?  You
set yourself up perfectly for that reaction.  What's the matter-- you can diss people, but you
can't take it in return?

omg, everyone just STFU. you're making too big of a deal out of this. it's 
causing a bunch of people to overreact or to attempt taking this potential 
smart-ass-reply opportunity and just fill our mailboxes with bs. let's just 
say that the original spellcheck remark was uncalled for. can we stop now? 
you guys even got me involved, making me contradict my idea of 'stopping the 
continuous bs emails'. there's probably going to be a reply to this email... 
but hey, at least i got my word in... i tried. it's just too ridiculous to go 
on. just stop.

one strategy, if you're not running linux, is to sub via hotmail, delete the
emails like this on sight, and then use Outlook Express for thje rest of yr
mail.

or u can just use linux.

Subject: [sfraves] ATP: Dustin Bowls

Feeding off the ZephyNewYork Post, where is Mr. Grownup? It seems it got a 
little to hot in the kitchen for Mr. Congeniality.

Boy there is nothing better than bashing someone who thinks there are "the 
standard". If there is one thing I have observed about SFRaves since 
subscribing; There is nothing standard about these folks, or thier posts!

Hooray for SFRaves.

Maybe next year Microsoft will release v.1.1 of the 
DustinBowlsSpellCheckforHotmail Plugin - We should start a petition.

"However, Christian groups in the United States have rejected Mr Bennett's

They have insisted that the arguments made in the article are lame."

Makes you proud to be an American sometimes. Dood your shit is lame. That's
totally not cool to say jesus was a stoner. Lame lame lame.

One day we'll get rid of the religiously ignorant and it will be a happy

I generally pay for my music, then rip them from CDs to my iPod, never
sharing them with others. Any other way might be construed as illegal, and
there's no room for that kind of criminal activity on the Internet! I would
highly suggest you refer your "friend" to http://www.riaa.org to learn the
truth about the deleterious effects of unauthorized digital music exchange
upon the health of the music industry. Remember: You're one click away from
robbing an artist of his/her hard-earned royalties.

After missing two different flights I am finally going to Bangkok, 
Thailand tonight. They have SO MANY pirated CDs in Thailand it is 
totally nutty. You can buy collections of 128k encoded mp3 cds for, 
like, 2 dollars! That's where I'd get my music, if I was into pop music 
: )  ...

Personally, I like to support the artists who's music I enjoy. I 
couldn't see pirating a John Digweed or Sasha CD because the more I 
contribute, the more I support the music in which I love, and then they 
make more music : )

Or.. just start listening to music that isn't over-looked by the RIAA.. 
You think the RIAA care about non-pop dance music? I think not : ) If 
it ain't on Mtv; they don't care!

Wait, wait, wait... They still have music on MTV!?!?  Woah.

In a horrible catch-22, it's the music that the RIAA may not care about
(i.e. indie, underground stuff) that I generally am more than happy to pay
for, and the commercialized pap that I have no remorse for downloading.

Go figure.  

Then again, I guess the artist doesn't get much money for white-label or
bootleg 12"s, eh?

Hardly. They're planning on pruning their already redundant supply down
to a measely *10* videos per *week*... Nice. I locked my girlfriend out
of the station on the cable box last week and things have been much
quieter around the house lately without all the "real world" re-runs and
spin-offs blaring ;)

You don't agree with nothing(anything) we have not said? So that means you
don't agree that the sky is blue because until now I hadn't said that. Guess
you don't agree with me that grammar and proof reading one line statements
is a good thing either. This must be a bad week for grammar.

So much left unsaid that this person doesn't agree with. Must be a very
difficult existance for you Jay.

well, just because religious groups rejected the idea that cannibus really 
has been used 'back in the day' doesnt necessarily mean that it wasnt true. 
yea, maybe the subject 'jesus was a pothead' has nothing to do with the 
article, but it could be a possibility that it weed was used in oil. 
religious groups dont want to accept it because of the effects weed has on 
people today, as a drug use. the non-acceptance of it is merely ignorance of 
the fact that it could be real, and they just dont want to admit it. i mean 
dont get me wrong, im not saying that it is true, im just sayin that it could 
be true, and no one wants to take the time to see if it really is. to say 
that a possible issue like this is lame is just being ignorant, ok maybe that 
term is a little too harsh, but non-accepting yes. THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX, is 
all im sayin.

peace sign to you,
-TENA-

sounds like it's a bit less of a stretch to state that Moses had a
tendency to engage in discussions with "burning shrubbery".  oh wait,
that's well documented... well as far as biblical stuff goes.  in the
bible, there are tons of stories or rape, incest, drunkenness, murder,
war, and people havin visions all the time... spending time trying to make
claims to what jesus was hiding in the pantry b'neath the cupcakes is just
silly and probably bad science/pop theology to boot.

Well, the story I heard was that Jesus was actually a vampire -- all that 
eternal life and drink my blood and eat my body stuff.  His lineage dates 
back to Osiris and the vampires of ancient Egypt.  Dateline is supposed to 
do an expose on this whole affair, and is attempting to gain access to the 
Vatican so they can prove Jesus and his crew are still living below the 
Pope's Palace.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] A New Year, Let's Re-Introduce Everyone On the List
 That Posts.

I'm John Dee. I lived in the bay area from may of 2000 until literally 
last thursday. I'm 21 years old, and am a divorced father of a beautiful 
girl named anna marie. I am a proud member of the moksha tribe, and 
believe that raving is a lifestyle.
I now reside in a suburb of phoenix, Arizona (read: middle of the 
fucking desert).
For those who want to contact me, my AIM ID is: AntiTuX, and ya'll 
already know my email address. I'll be back in the bay area to visit in 
a couple of months, once I stabilize things out here, and of course, 
will *ALWAYS* be at the moksha tribe parties :)

hmm, it's plausible enough for the BBC to pick up, but not for your opinion?

suit yourself.

Can't remember a WWN item they've ever picked up.

HT has made significant changes in its editorial direction in the last
decade, you might want to check out a recent copy, or do you still subscribe
to the stereotype that all that enjoy cannabis are stoner losers?

If cannabis ever gets decriminalized in this country, don't forget to thank
them for their efforts.

from the BBC article originally linked:

"The author of the article, published in the US drugs magazine High Times,
says his findings are based on a study of scriptural texts."

oh, yeah, "High Times" is a plausible source for archaeological information.
  much like the "Weekly World News" is a plausible source for information on
space-alien breeding techniques.  next...

actually, that would be if he had said that he "tends to not agree with *everything* any of you have
not said so far."   what he said is a logical conundrum.   it can be taken both ways depending on
the logical sense of the starting negation "not."   it is essentially like saying absolutely
nothing.   silly i know...  these smart asses that just get done with their symbolic logic finals
and think they're an instant mensa puke *shakes head, waives finger*

someday he'll take critical thinking and learn that the correct way to end a thread is by mentioning
"Hitler." ;)

eveyone knows about the big anti-war march on jan. 18,

Subject: [sfraves] reintroduce...

hey everyone.. i'm monikat, i don't post a lot, and i
don't read this list every day (just too much mail,
and i try not to do too much internetting at times)
but i figured i'm on today so i'll say hello.  been
dancing to edm and loving it since '92, and it's an
integral part of my life.  i've thrown lots of parties
(mostly UGs and benefits), mixed together partying and
protests a lot (reclaim the streets, and a recent
experiment in sonick/sound system resistance at the
gates of the nevada test site, and i like cats,
anarchism, creative resistance, and books.  oh, and
going to the gym, which is a newfound source of
pleasure for me.  i'm also pagan, and currently
interested in sacred sites and earth energy.  and i
need a trip out of this country right now.  what else?
 i love detroit techno, heaven would be a party in the
woods on a balmy night w/ jay denham and dj rush (i
know he's chicago), nah, make that a wild, unpermitted
street party w/ jay denham and dj rush on a balmy
night in some city under a full moon.  dislikes
include wage work, the whole wage system, capitalism,
environmental devastation, and people's alienation
from and lack of respect for the earth that nourishes
us and susains us, cuz you know, the world could be so
much better.  

ok, back to work.
monikat

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


i am thinking a lot about shoes, and then, i started thinking about how sometimes some people have enough money for some good shoes, and then they still don't have them, and why does that happen? well, here is one answer...sometimes, the person is asleep when all of the shoe stores are opened, and the shoe stores are all closed when the person has the time to go and look for the shoes at the shoe store....oh, i was going to post another poem, i guess...here, i'll write one up real quick with a rave theme:

it was all day-glow in the twilight of the hum

there were baggie pants and adults sucking their thumbs

we used to use pacifiers, but then those got pegged

even if your not on ecstacy, you can surely still rave

it's too bad a lot of people don't know that 

for reasons untold

i miss my green glowsticks

other lights are legal, i'm told

if trance is a hobby

and dance is a lie

then i guess we'd all be candied

and happily, sooooooooooooo fly...........okay, that is enough easy poem writing for now....oh, other things? maybe,,,,i have other things on my brain like i accidentally erased a couple of newsletters and that is okay, i guess, but also, i would have liked to have read them.........ummmmmmmm, maybe more later. :)

you not get enough hugs when you were little?

To truly support the artists, buy directly from them at their shows.

The article he's talking about is probably this one:
http://dir.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/06/14/love/index.html

Give it a read, your summary is pretty far off the mark.

Personally, I have no issues with sharing music if it's fair-use - i.e.
reasonably limited, not in mass quantities like the heydey of napster.
(The idea of measuring your music collection in Gigabytes is like
evaluating Faulkner's writing "by the pound.") When I do buys CD's, I try
to stick to the used stores:  Amoeba, Rasputin's are two great examples
with large selection and a few locations to pick from.

On the other hand, MP3's alone do nothing to help artists.

They're just a file format, and can often hurt the artist: take the case
of poorly-encoded files that misrepresent the kind of quality production
an artist or producer is capable of. (That's Andy's usual point, and
quite a good one I think)

My take on this is that an artist should be proactive about distributing
digital media of their work, providing widely-available MP3 or OGG files
that are copiously tagged with creator and contact information, and
encoded to the /artist's/ satisfaction. We're on the cusp of a massive
change in the way that media is distributed and controlled - the RIAA is
bungling the transition, trying to apply 1920's rules to a market that's
being pulled out from under their feet. The people who can succeed in a
world of freely exchangeable music are the ones who can use the medium to
its best advantage. I don't know what that implies, though - I'm hoping I
won't end up having to put up with plugs for Sprite in the middle of
tracks I like. :-P

Fred Von Lohmann of the EFF summarized the case for fair use pretty well
in an interview on techfocus.org:

=09"Oh, and by the way, once you've busted all the "Sopranos"
=09sharers, don't be surprised if you see a drop in new HBO
=09subscriptions, as you've ended up killing off a free, viral
=09marketing channel that most consumer-products companies would have
=09given their right arm for. But hey, it always pays to ignore your
=09marketing staff and let the lawyers run the show, doesn't it?"

That's part of what I mean.  I try to buy from the most direct source.
Be it their own website, or at a show, or from them.  I try not to
patronize the big stores unless I can't find their music anywhere else.

To truly support the artists, buy directly from them at their shows.

wait wait lemme clarify....no, the artist doesn't get money from MP3s, but 
they do get publicity.  people get their hands on their songs, like them and 
go to the shows.  like someone said, direct support for the artist is at the 
shows.  MP3s could help bypass the exposure from the record company (who pays 
for the videos, sets up interviews on MTV, etc.)  instead it goes from artist 
to people to people to people etc.  see what i mean?? kinda??  iono, if i had 
a bunch of money i would start a website that charged a small fee for artists 
to put up their songs for free download.  so the artists get publicity for 
muuuuuuch less than they end up paying the record company out of proceeds.  
ok enough rambling, i just wanted to clarify part of my point :)

quoth PacoG383@aol.com:

In more "traditional" agreements, that's usually the case. More and more
independent labels are working out better deals for artists though, so
be sure to research your labels, and even solicit information from the
artists yourself, if you need to know how they're being treated before
buying their music.

> MP3s are the best thing for the artist since....uh....sliced bread??

Supporting artists involves a lot more than just firing up your favorite
file sharing app and grabbing every single track you can find. If you're
really interested in supporting artists, try getting involved with the
effort to restructure the industry compensation and royalty systems...
And if you can, buy direct from labels and artists :)

> but still buy CDs or they'll crack down on MP3s more so than they are
> now (that's my 2 cents there :) )

I don't buy that at all. The RIAA's been blaming the "slump" in CD sales
on file sharing for years now, when the stats prove otherwise: people
that are exposed to new music in a collaborative environment in fact
tend to buy *more* CD's.

But they're also starting to raise the prices of CD's to "compensate"
for the "loss" in profit due to file sharing, resulting in some
exorbitantly high prices. Meanwhile, people are starting to realize,
thanks to the introduction of consumer CD burning software and hardware,
how *cheap* it is to actually make them. If anything, I say *boycott* CD
retailers until they start making music more affordable.

Tell the big record companies to eliminate wasteful packaging, and give
potential listeners incentives to buy CD's, like discounts on concert
tickets. Make individual tracks available online for cheap, instead of
forcing people to buy $18 discs that they just end up ripping to MP3.
And most importantly, promote and practice diversity on public radio and
television. Why anyone would buy a CD without even hearing a single
track off it (artist obsession, trusted recommendation, or word of mouth
nonwithstanding) is beyond me.

Furthermore, if you just want to stick it to the RIAA, just support
independent music. Solicit DJ's for mix tapes, and look for new music at
record stores (where you can listen to the vinyl even if you're not
going to buy it!). Go to more live shows, and attempt to contact artists
you like to tell them how great they are. :)

No, it's like describing your personal library by the pound.  The quality

Abstract:

Rave Culture and Religion is an edited collection of 16 essays written by=20
academics and experienced cultural commentators who explore the=20
socio-cultural and religious dimensions of the rave, 'raving' and=20
rave-derived phenomena. Scholars of contemporary religion, dance=20
ethnologists, sociologists and other cultural observers unravel this core=20
cultural practice amongst contemporary youth. Though various commentators=20
have initiated research on this youth cultural moment, Rave Culture and=20
Religion will be the first venue devoted to such research.

Despite its diasporic fragmentation and hybridisation throughout the=20
nineties, the dance party rave - involving masses of youth dancing=20
all-night to a syncopated electronic rhythm mixed by DJs - maintains=20
rapturous popularity in the West. Commonly accorded effects ranging from=20
personal 'healing' or replenishment, to transformations on social, cultural=
=20
or political scales, the rave - from clubland, to outdoor doof, to=20
technomadic festival - is a hyper-crucible of contemporary youth=20
spirituality. The question thus arises: What is the role of the=20
technocultural rave in the spiritual life of contemporary youth?

Emerging in London in 1988 and subsequently exported around the world, the=
=20
rave has proliferated and mutated alongside associated music (electronic)=20
and body ('ecstasy') technologies. Throughout the nineties, vast numbers of=
=20
western youth attached primary significance to raving and post-rave=20
experiences. Regularly regarded by participants as a site of=20
'self-transcendence', a kind of temporary utopia, the rave grew prevalent=20
in the experience of urban youth. With the combined stimulus of electronic=
=20
musics, psychotropic lighting and chemical alterants, young novices and=20
experienced habitues transcended the mundane in converted warehouses,=20
wilderness areas, beaches, deserts and streets.

Participants and observers have variously reported 'communion',=20
'telepathy', 'trance' states, 'ecstasy' or the 'sacred' along with a=20
transcendence of subject, ethnic or gender categories at rave and post-rave=
=20
events. Producers of rave soundscapes and visual components (from video=20

=20
often deemed 'tribal' celebrations  even 'corroborees'. And, experienced=20
habitues of dance champion psychedelic 'sacraments', sometimes claimed to=20
accelerate the reception of esoteric knowledge.

Yet a torrent of inquiry issues from our initial question. Is the rave a=20
nascent rite de passage  and, if so, what is its telos? What is its level=20
and quality of efficacy? Is it a ritual of communion, a mass 'return' to a=

'womb' which sees co-inhabitants secure in a nutrient rich and numinous=20

This should be a great party, I'm personally really looking forward to it.
I've had the opportunity to play with Chris Liberator a few times in the
past and he is definitely a techno super-star.

In fact, It seems like a lot of people have been getting back into Techno
lately, which is a welcome change in my opinion.

And now with DDR added to the line up along with Ant, we've got the
opportunity to see a number of the UK Techno originators in an intimate

guess who's back?

one of the original goatrance navigators is flying into SF for our =
(((THUMP))) party this saturday night:  OLLI WISDOM of SPACE TRIBE =
(spiritzone records, germany) will be performing live and also djing =
into the wee morning hours.

we throw monthly psytrance parties at the dna but when olli comes, it is =
something special.  his music hasn't mellowed or cooled out.  there is =
massive mental energy to his sets that take the party to the next level.

much of the new psytrance has a reserved and subtle quality and build to =
it - some would argue it is more techno than trance.  olli's trance =
reaches into your cerebral cortex and jerks you into another dimension.  =
if you like trance and a thick vibe, please join us saturday.

http://www.thumpradio.com/thumpparty.cfm

LIMITED presale tickets are available there on the site.

:)

looking very forward to olli, he's one of our favorites.

the only one i've heard of is liberator. the rest i have no idea. been in the scene 13 years.
i'd vote for dave clarke as one of the uk tech originators before i would liberator. 
 Morgan <morgan@hardnrg.com> wrote:This should be a great party, I'm personally really looking forward to it.
I've had the opportunity to play with Chris Liberator a few times in the
past and he is definitely a techno super-star.

In fact, It seems like a lot of people have been getting back into Techno
lately, which is a welcome change in my opinion.

And now with DDR added to the line up along with Ant, we've got the
opportunity to see a number of the UK Techno originators in an intimate
setting showing us exactly how it's done!

Hope to see you there,
Morgan

So-- After my portfolio domain expired at antialias.net and of course,
since it was such a kick ass domain name -- it was promptly stolen by
URL pirates that now want more than $1000 bux for my domain back. Well
SKREW THEM! I am a creative guy, and after much brainstorming, I
return!! 
 
This time with a new email addy. 
 
So HI and stuff!

PS- I should be at Code this Thursday. You should be too.

school breakbeat madness to replace this morning's rain wetness with
some sweaty wetness.

Check out his new site for futher information about the man:

As usual, LOTs of goodies to pass your way today, so do tune in.

RITMOS DE BRASIL EP 
Phuturo/US/2x12 
An amazing selection of bits straight from the heart of the drum & bass revolution: Sao Paolo, Brazil. Featuring the likes of four fresh faces, the skills on display here are actually quite different than what youd imagine. Drumagicks Sambarock is the only bit that shakes and boogies with that still-addictive Brazilian flavor. Mikrob follows up with the most wicked street-level hitter on Wild before DJ Marnel dips into deep-house influenced territory on the jaw-dropping Good Vibes.  Be sure to save some love for the twisting, turning Zionite by Telefunken, an essential bit of future-dub bizness for all the electro-rastas.

Subject: [sfraves] bsp! record sale! 375 records!

Hello everyone. I am slimming down my record collection. I have 375 records
I don't need any more. Actually, some of these are LPs or EPs with more than
one record in them (I have two hip-hop LPs with four slabs of vinyl apiece)
so the total number of actual physical records is actually probably closer
to 400.

The records for sale span a wide, wide range. The following genres are all
represented:

hip-hop
jungle (all subgenres)
techno
house
breaks (new-school and old)
turntablism
downtempo
trance
psytrance
breaktrance
acid trance
cybertrance
epic trance
melodic trance
every other damn kind of trance
2-step garage
regular garage
happycore
80s favorites
classical music

etc., etc., etc!

the best-represented genre is jungle. the bulk of the collection is hip-hop.

there are some definite winners in the collection - rare old-school Amen
jungle white labels, the first record DJ Z-Trip ever released, a Muppets
album, a happycore version of "It's A Fine Day," and so on and so forth.
however there are some definite losers as well. for example, the Journey
album "Infinity," which is free to anyone who wants it (but you have to pay
postage).

additionally, not all the records have been posted yet, especially in the
house or techno sections, and the categories are loose at best. there are
jungle remixes in the breaks section, and there are Madonna remixes in the
downtempo section (but these have already been spoken for). the wisest thing
to do is check out the section you're most interested in, and also scroll
thru the other sections just in case. this is the same as in a real-life
record store. in order to make it interesting, I started adding detailed
descriptions, especially in the jungle section, but I had to stop, because
it took too long, and in some cases the descriptions didn't even tell you
that much about the record. (as an example, my description of a Seba ambient
jungle track consists entirely of a story about a time when I climbed forty
feet up a tree while under the influence of Red Bull.)

for reasons which are unlikely to ever make sense to anyone, least of all
myself, I live in New Mexico. New Mexico is part of the United States. it's
located between Arizona and Texas. therefore in order to buy any of these
records, you need to send me cash (or Paypal) and INCLUDE BOTH YOUR ADDRESS
AND THE RECORDS YOU WANT TO BUY. last year I sold a bunch of records on eBay
and you'd be surprised how many people didn't figure out that I needed these
particular pieces of information.

these records themselves are also destined for eBay, but I'm posting them
here first for the sake of good karma. last year an old-school rare electro
compilation I bought for $15 sold on eBay for over $70. obviously, profit is
good, but part of me would almost rather let some sfraver grab some of this
stuff before I go trolling for dollars on eBay.

finally, everybody on sfr who doesn't want to buy my records, apologies for
the long-ass post.


peace, love, underwear, and rabbits,
Giles


ps!!! the song "Hyperreal," after which hyperreal.org was originally named,
is included in this collection. :-)

PPS!!! sorry - in order to view the records, you need the web link. here it
is.

http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=dreamstooloud&itemid=77303

ppps - I will try to get all the remaining records posted in the near
future.

Usually, when you're trying to get people to visit a web site, it's a

Will, let me just say the DDR rocked my world at the FNF camp out. And I know the crew that is putting on this party. They have a hole lot of love to be risking their necks to bring these DJ's over to the states to play in some cow town (Galt) because there are no venues in the Bay area to house them.I have worked with then and know that they put on great parties.
  I am an old timer to this scene and need to believe in it as it was, not how it has become. If you believe in the music as a way to heal, to bring people together and to just dance to. Then we just might change the way things have become. Or you can just drop a pill and make it stay the same.
 I hope you all can make it to this party. In fact I will open up my warehouse to those who need a place to crash. E-mail me if you want to stay over and get some food and sleep.
Much love
Rodney

I think that little problem with email lacking a solid tone of voice got the
best of you. Scott's comments were not an attack. He asked for the the link
with a dash of sarcasm. Time to release some of that frustration at the
march! =)

Ya know, for someone/ some group that/who is supposed to be compassionate 
about Big, Bad Mean US going to war against little small world, and all the 
other poor, poor victims of the world who the US constantly keeps down, that 
really wasn't nice. Where's the compassion?

Could it be that these organizations have ulterior motives? Or, is this just 
what they call showing your true colors?

I figured you would have been so happy to share this important life saving 
information, that you would have been offering rides to the event?

http://www.dailyrecord.com/news/02/12/19/news4-rave.htm

a promoter gets a bill for emergency room expenses for kids who had been at
his event - poor guy says he might just pay them.

no!!!  did bill graham get bills for hippies who od'ed at his rock concerts
and ended up in emergency rooms?  i don't think so!

ridiculous!

outrageous!

unfair!

respect!
love!
solidarity!

i think thomas heckman is more known in acid techno circles than liberator would be. although he's german not brit.

Hey, 

Anyone have (or know of anyone who has) some turn tables they are looking to get rid of? 

Was hoping someone out there might be able to help out a novice or at least point me in the right direction without making a huge dent in the wallet. 

Appreciate any info you can provide me. 

Thanks!

2 brand-new Ortofon needles (one used for less than a month, the other never
used)
Sony Headphones
Vestax Mixer
Mackie 1204VLZ PA Mixer
Event Tria Powered Studio Monitors and Subwoofer
Pornographic Slipmats
Blue Metal Turntable Covers
Bottle of Groove-Glide (or "Gruv Glide" as it's spelled on the package)

dude, whatever! acid techno is excellent music.

this would totally be the beginning of a rant against the anal-retentive
closed-mindedness of purists - except that of all my records that I'm
selling, I'm keeping only four techno records, and two of them are from
Resource.

so, I'm not gonna talk shit, and you are spared the rant attack.

(which is good for everybody!)

Subject: [sfraves] hey djs - what mixer?

after a long dry spell, i finally bought a 2nd 1200 and now i have 2 decks
again (woo!).  but no mixer yet.  what mixer do you recommend?  i don't
want to spend what too much, but i do want some eq/kill action, some nice
prelistening options, decent quality...  anyone try the behringer
mixers?  they have bpm counters, which turns me off, but i suppose i could
cover them with tape so as not to distract myself.

J,
You don't have to tape over the BPM counter!  LOL  It's ok to have it there :)  It's up to you
whether or not you wanna use it.  And I haven't seen one built into a mixer that's very accurate
anyway.

Do you scratch?  Or plan on scratching with your mixer?  If so, I recommend a Vestax.  I have the
PMC 07 Pro ISP.  I use it for cutting, and of course, for mixing.  The only thing I don't like
about it is that it's not compatible with my Final Scratch.  Do you plan on getting FS?

that's just it - i think if it's down there, glowing and wrong, it might

possibly but it's not my biggest concern.  i want to do smooooov mixing of

yeah, i would like to get final scratch.  it's fucking awesome.  i saw
amon tobin dj a set using it, and it was like he was mystically refreshing
his tracks without ever putting on a new record.  people in the crowd kept
saying "how is he doing that?"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] hey djs - what mixer?

i have a Behringer DX 1000 mixer which i bought off the Net last spring, 
because it was reasonably featured and HELLA cheap.  two microphone input 
channels (mono) which i use when i record radio stuff for Burning Man, five 
stereo inputs, decent cuing but a bit twiddly compared to more 
straightforward monitoring.  no BPM counter.  seems to clip below the 
red-line level when you REALLY push the bass (but one usually doesn't want 
to do a +12dB bass boost anyway).  i wish there was more than +/-12dB of 
bass boost/cut, but it's adequate for switching from one track's bottom-end 
to the other with the bass kill switches.  it's pretty big physically, and 
the knobs are a bit small.  nice long throw on the channel faders.  works 
well in a home-studio setting; i also brought it out to Strange Brew (the 
happy-hour thing at the Savoy i had a residency at last year) once to use 
for a 2x4 with Andy Tie-Die, and it sounded good in the live setting as 
well.  very clean sound as long as you keep the level below peak.  hope this 
helps.

      I would recomend a Rane. You can find a used one for pretty cheap (like $300 )and you won't find a better sounding mixer. 
 I just got rid of my pioneer 600 (they f*cking suck donkey dick) and got a new MP 44. The difference in sound quality has me as giddy as a school girl! Love it love it love it! The only thing that sucks is I have gone through hell trying to find a coffin that will fit it, but I just put in an order to have one custom made for it by odyessey. The difference in sound quality was well worth the coffin drama though.

J,
My Vestax does just fine for mixing too-- the crossfader AND both up & down faders have adjustable
curve.  So they can be adjusted for scratching OR for mixing-- whichever you feel like doing at
the time.  It'll be nice to get a mixer with adjustable faders (crossfader at the minimum) if you
wanna scratch later on.

If you wanna get the Final Scratch, make sure you get a mixer with phono AND line inputs with a
switch.  Unfortunately for me, the 07 Pro ISP is one of the very few mixers that doesn't have a
phono/line input switch.  I had to get a cheapie mixer to hook my FS up to.

Have fun shopping!  And shop around!  Use that "lowest price guarantee" to your advantage.  And if
you're on a budget, check out slightly used mixers.  Mine was a return or a floor model.  It got
shipped to me in the box and looked (and performed) like brand new-- it still does!  But I got it
for a used price...

this is precisely what i'm using the Behringer for...post-Basic Channel 
stuff and ambient/experimental soundscapes.  the cross-fader is really good, 
but you'll probably want to take the bottom plate off the mixer and twiddle 
with the two adjustments for the VCA crossfader which are available on the 
circuit board.

A better question is......

How much money do you have to spend? I could list a handful of $1000+
mixers,but if you only want to spend $500, that doesn't do any good.

yeah, i would like to get final scratch.  it's fucking awesome.  i saw
amon tobin dj a set using it, and it was like he was mystically
refreshing
his tracks without ever putting on a new record.  people in the crowd
kept

I didn't recommend that he buy the most expensive top of the line model Vestax.  Vestax has a huge
line of mixers, from way expensive to inexpensive.

Hey kids, geeking out a moment.

I'm purchasing a new 17" powerbook, and am a member of Apple Developer
Connection, but a low end (free) one.  The ADC Pricing would save my
broke ass almost a thousand dollars, so i thought i'd check to see if
any of you have a "hardware discount asset" you could transfer to my
account.  I'd love ya forever, and i could even arrange a small monetary
exchange for the favor, since you'd be saving me a bundle.  Hit me up
off list if you can help.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] VESTAX Re: [sfraves] hey djs - what mixer? 

i use a vestax pmc 170A, w/ platinum connectors.  kill
switches on each of the highs, mids and lows, that and
it shines (for the aesthetic in you).  i've had it
almost 3 years and i'm just now having to replace the
crossfader (ooh..optical).  here's a link:

http://www.vestax.com/products/pmc17a.htm

i think the best thing is the pfl doesn't fade in
volume when you adjust the knobs, unlike other mixers
where you have to keep them at normal keel in order to
hear the queue.

I have an 07 PRO ISP and a Final Scratch.  And yes, they don't work together.  BUT  I just got in an inverted RIAA converted, and am in the process of building a 19" rackmountable FS interface that will hold the FS and the RIAA converter, alowing any mixer to interface to the FS...

If anyone is interested I might consider selling some of the units for those other 07 PRO ISP users that don't want to change mixers just to use their FS... it probablly won't be more than 100$ in total... but I won't know for sure..

Subject: [sfraves] VESTAX SUCKS?!  WHATEVER!!!  RE: [sfraves] VESTAX Re: [sfraves] hey djs - what mixer?

How can you people say stuff like this, when MYRIAD deejays like QBert and Craze and H.O.P. swear
by Vestax?!  Just because you have no use for such a mixer doesn't mean it sucks.  This is like
saying that all SUVs suck because you like sports cars.  Or that redheads suck coz you like
blondes.  LOL  Just because you may not know anything about scratching doesn't mean that Vestax
mixers suck.

C'mon now, quit being so childish.  I never said that your brand of mixers suck, even though I
don't care for them, DID I?!

A very good point.. Vestax makes some great mixers for turntablists in
particular - Upmarket brands like Rane or Allen & Heath make some killer
club/pro gear, etc. etc.  Though I'm just as likely to take a friend's
endorsement as much as some celebrity DJ, knowing that everyone swears by
whatever brand they've been loyal to forever.

Actually, they DO suck ;)

Ummm..

Vestax kicks ass (I own an 05 and an 07-pro isp)...

Rane kicks ass (TTM 56 especially) (I never used any of their battle mixers until I HAD to battle on one at a battle where I was told they would have an 07, it was like going to bed with Camerson Diaz, and waking up with a woody on J-lo's booty... different, unexpected, but was I complaining?)... 

I am looking into Tascam X-9 myself currently... any skilled turntablists have an opnion there? particularly for DnB mixing?


And Redheads and Blondes BOTH SUCK!!!






if you're nice to 'em...





most mixer's released today are pretty fucking decent... my buddy just bought the newer NuMark against my recommendations... and besides it's gimmiky effects section.. it's pretty damn nice.. every company caught on to the crossfader curve fad started by vestax.. so that little game is over...

I even got drunk enough at a club the other night and some poor progressive house DJ got to watch me fill the room when he let me cut on his $150 Behringer... 


point being.... no matter what you buy... work on your skillz... cuz it ain't the mixer... it's the DJ...


and as an ex-promoter I can tell you Swamp, Craze, Qbert, and A-Trak.. all top notch turntablists... list at least Vestax, Rane and Pioneer in their contracts...

many top Junglists are now listing Allen Heath, Rane, Vestax AND Pioneer in their contracts...


so don't get all bent up on one brand of mixers... when you get good.. it won't matter that much...

if you're new... don't spend much... just PRACTICE until you REALLY feel like you've hit the limits... by then you'll have played enough shows on enough gear to know EXACTLY what you want...

ok... due to popular request.. I'll shut the fuck up now..

Getting cut would lead to death which would mean I was freed from having to 
read her endless horrible posts (can we have a weekly maximum from the 
moderator?). If she's your girlfriend you certainly aren't handling your 
business, she's got way too much time to think and post. Take away her 
keyboard and get her a glow in the dark vibrating butt plug.
 A month back when she was a topic she retreated away into the dark, but like 
Gollem she has come back to madly type on her "precious" and fill our list 
with all things boring, esoteric and plain dumb. Ain't adding any flavor just 
an opportunity to delete.
 Anyone want to flame me...you know the silent majority agrees!

Thanx for the kind words, Omid!  At least someone here knows their mixers!  :)  (As a matter of
fact, one of those celebrity DJs is a very good friend of mine-- I based my Vestax purchase
decision on its quality & cost and not on who endorsed it.)

I've used several brands (good and bad-- I'm not ashamed to admit) of mixers and owned a few--
Rane, Numark, Pioneer, Gemini, Realistic, GLi, Vestax, and several more that you prolly heard of. 
They ALL have their applications.  Even the GLi had its application-- I only had a C note in my
wallet, and I was in a hurry to hook up my Final Scratch.  I didn't want to fly all the way to
Hawaii just to get one of my other mixers out of storage.  So I got it.  Is its sound quality
inferior?  Yes!  But did it work?  Yes!  And I got my FS hooked up with change to spare in my
pocket.  Enough to get cables, slipmats and a few slices of real East Coast pie!

Not if you're camping near a stream just as a storm's about to hit, and the water/mud goes up to
your waist ;)  Or in some other similar predicament...

J,
if you're nice to them...  I like that! ;)  But...  






Do they swallow?!  LOL  I was thinking along the same lines, but didn't wanna get flamed, so I
didn't put a similar line in there  LOL

I totally agree with you, J.  Equipment does not make a good deejay, SKILLZ MAKE A GOOD DEEJAY. 
Remember back in the day when we used to cut on the old Numarks?  Compared to today's crossfaders,
cutting/mixing on my old Numark was like being a 300-pound fat kid trying to swim through
quicksand.  But we used to do it!  I may be dating myself here, but my boys and I used to spin on
the old Technics turnies with the rotary pitch knobs!  Anyone remember those?  LOL  It was hard as
f#*k, but we managed without today's top of the line equipment...

and PERFECT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT!

Agreed. I'm currently using an old-school Gemini as well, and although I'm
looking to replace it (the audio throughput is getting muddy), it's good
enough for now and - if anything - its lack of whiz-bang gadgetry is (I
think) making me a better DJ.

Until my friend and I returned it - buyer's remorse w/ a $1300 price tag - I
loved the Allen & Heath Xone 62 to death.  It was the smoothest,
best-sounding, oh-my-god-this-thing-runs-itself mixer I'd ever touched
(IMO).  But then I realized why we loved it so much - its various
equalization and DSP effects made it far too easy to cover up fuck-ups.
Granted, if I had a gig and the venue was supplying a Xone 62, I'd be giddy
over the prospect of fewer trainwrecks, but I know now that using a bare
bones mixer is going to reveal any imperfections and force me to acquire
more "skillz," as one might say.  :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] vestax is good

I gotta stand in defense of Vestax. I've had a Vestax mixer for years. if I
had the cash I'd plunk down for an Allen & Heath (and this is in fact one of
the reasons I'm selling my Vestax) but among hip-hop DJs and turntablists
Vestax is the industry standard.

Allen & Heath mixers are British, and they're just like anything British -
for instance, British SUVs. the top British SUV is the Land Rover. I live on
the side of a mountain, and up here, everybody knows that the Land Rover is
**the** SUV to have. they're completely indestructible. the guy who wrote
"Cryptonomicon" wrote this about British design:

"there's no in-between with these people. you have to walk four miles before
you find a telephone box, but when you do, it's built as if the senseless
dynamiting of telephone boxes was a serious problem in the past."

I'm quoting from memory so I could be slightly off, but you get the idea.

Allen & Heath mixers are built as if the senseless dynamiting of mixers was
a serious problem in the past.

Vestax mixers are built to be useful. plain as that. they have high-end
models and low-end models. they have models designed for turntablists - and
models designed BY turntablists - as well as models designed specifically
for New York house DJs. and they have loads of multi-purpose models designed
for everybody.

I dunno about Rane. personally I've always thought Rane mixers were bulky,
inelegant, and over-rated. but you can't be over-rated without being quality
in the first place.

Very true...

My first setup was a pair of Technics SLD-2's (the rotary knobs, but they were directdrive.  actually I had a pioneer belt drive and a cd player first, but that doesn't really count to me).. and a Pyramid 19" mixer that had a click in the middle of the crossfader and a raised corssfader plate so you would rub the skin off your knuckles cutting...

did I sound good on 'em?  well.. mixing house wasn't bad... but hip-hop? hell nah... but I got my hand eye coordination down so that when i finally got some 12's and a vestax (well gemini scratchmaster first, but vestax about a year later)... I could school any cat that came up on the 12's that their daddy bought 'em... haha...


oh and as far as getting flamed... i'm sure the ladies on here have a sense of humour... and realize I'm not a sexist pig...







unless they try to vote, or work.. or wear shoes or some crazy shit like that!!!




j/k - please don't have my house burned to the ground grrrls.. :)





and to prove the "you don't need gear to be dope" theory as it pertains to production... check out the ill style ragga DnB my boy Tangent has produced using his comp, an o1V, an EPS16, and some alesis monitor ones...

www.hooknpull.com for all ya junglists!!!!!!! str8 sickness!!

ok... enough shameless plugs for now..

didn't you know? It's got a built in counter, where very time a tune is
played, it rings up $1 against your revolving credit account with RIAA.

--=====================_16902191==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I hear Audrey Joseph, the force behind Club Townsend, has teamed up with a 
local designer, Pat McNerney, to create a combined arts and dance club 
venue in SF.  The venue is in an entirely new space.

Guess they are not far from launch because Audrey is already testing the 
old Townsend email list.

Love,

Apollo

It rocks... perhaps a little too hard :)  From my previous email:

<< Until my friend and I returned it - buyer's remorse w/ a $1300 price tag
- I loved the Allen & Heath Xone 62 to death.  It was the smoothest,
best-sounding, oh-my-god-this-thing-runs-itself mixer I'd ever touched
(IMO).  But then I realized why we loved it so much - its various
equalization and DSP effects made it far too easy to cover up fuck-ups.
Granted, if I had a gig and the venue was supplying a Xone 62, I'd be giddy
over the prospect of fewer trainwrecks, but I know now that using a bare
bones mixer is going to reveal any imperfections and force me to acquire
more "skillz," as one might say. >>

Pound for pound, the best damn mixer on earth.  Ok, that's kind of a joke or
maybe not, because the thing weighs like half an ounce (exaggeration) - it's
one of the drawbacks to the unit, actually. Although they have a reputation
for being as bulletproof as 1200's, the material of the Xone62 felt VERY
light and chintzy. In fact, ours shipped with an ugly ding in it from the
box being jostled around by UPS.  You can seriously pick this thing up with
one hand and (if you dare) twirl it around on your finger like a basketball.

My other complaint about it is the non-standard size.. it's not nearly as
narrow as a scratch mixer, but it's not a 19"-er either, and it doesn't have
rackmount ears.  I heard there are kits for them, but that's an added
expense on an already expensive unit.  *sigh*

They have another model - I forget the number - which is full-size, has more
inputs and doubles as a recording board, which is good for gigging musicians
and for recording, as well as DJing. Totally up my alley!  The near-$2k
sticker price, though, is rather offputting. It does look like a super-solid
unit, but I have yet to see it in person.

i love allen & heath.  they're tied w/rane for making the highest quality,
most durable, best sounding mixers out there.  period.

you can run them redlined for *days*, and there will never be a peep,
clip, crackle or sound degradation.

i'm also the proud daddy of the xone:32...  had that baby for almost three
years now and i can't sing it's praises high enough.  8^)

Subject: [sfraves] Eridanus Feb 22 2003 BSP!!!!!

Just a heads up that I will be playing at Eridanus
next month. This party should be pretty phat! The
people throwing it are trying to keep an old skool
vibe and are giving away a bunch of free stuff as
well. Look out for over three hundred free promo cds
mixed by myself and possiblly other people.
Cheers
Keith Edwards

The only funky thing about that mixer is having the gains on the rear panel.
Crossfader adjust doesn't offer a sharp enough cut either. Excellent
studio/club mixer. I have a Xone 64 in the house right now which is
beautiful to learn on. Just doesn't work so well when you want to try
learning turntablism. But damn... clean clean sound off that unit. I'm going
to get Marshal to bring his Rane Empath over. That mixer seems to be the
answer for quality and features.

i love allen & heath.  they're tied w/rane for making the highest quality,
most durable, best sounding mixers out there.  period.

you can run them redlined for *days*, and there will never be a peep,
clip, crackle or sound degradation.

i'm also the proud daddy of the xone:32...  had that baby for almost three
years now and i can't sing it's praises high enough.  8^)

this is called "dj darwinism".  if the dj can't find the fucking gains, he
shouldn't be adjusting them!  8^)

this is slightly rectified if you get the upgraded penny&giles crossfader,
but you're right:  the curve isn't steep enough for serious scratch djs.

word to that.  in this case, you truly do get what you pay for (and then
some!  pricey....).

the xone 32 was the king of the smaller dj mixers, but the empath methinks
has taken the crown now.  i haven't had a chance to play on one of them,
but it's a rane, and i'm quite sure it's sex-a-liscous!

i would add that detroit techno is rather boring. we're definitly not in the hard techno age(i.e. the real bangin stuff) anymore. it's minimal time these days in technoland. zzzz
 
 Giles Bowkett <gilesbowkett@neobeatnik.com> wrote:dude, whatever! acid techno is excellent music.

this would totally be the beginning of a rant against the anal-retentive
closed-mindedness of purists - except that of all my records that I'm
selling, I'm keeping only four techno records, and two of them are from
Resource.

so, I'm not gonna talk shit, and you are spared the rant attack.

(which is good for everybody!)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] odorless dancing nrr( Geri's posts smell)

Do you know what is even more annoying than a Geri post? Reading replies to 
her from other people.

I have been filtering Geri's post to the trash for over a year now. Get 
this...I haven't seen a SINGLE post from her since. But I have seen multiple 
people bitching and whining about Geri. Do yourself a favor. Hell, do *me* a 
favor. Use your filters. You will never have to see her emails again. You 
really have nothing to lose.

And please try and think of what a hypocrite you are. You have posted 
multiple times today about how obnoxious and non rave related Geri's emails 
are. And what have your emails contributed? Trash, trash, trash. Although my 
inbox isn't cluttered with nrr emails from Geri, my inbox *is* cluttered 
with your nrr crap.

Use your filters. If that's too complicated for you, go through your mail 
before you start reading and delete anything you don't want to read.

Thanks.

-Veronica

excuse this for being very old - I only get the digest
version...
 
Britty,

Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for the information
on the march, regardless of the bad day thing.  The
cool thing is, I am going to the march because you
took the time to post your message.  Well, actually I
wanted to go anyway, but had forgot about the details,
dates, etc. and your post helped remind me.  So you
sorta deserve the credit.
 
And thanks for the apology too, that doesn't seem to
happen here too often.  It takes guts to apologize.

- Pedro.

PS: there is like really no chance in hell to find
people in such a large crowd, but to anyone going, if
I can dig it out of the laundry bin, I will be wearing
my SFRaves t-shirt (the real blue one from Philip not
the bogus white one I saw on that other web site), so
say hi if you see me.

I felt that I was educating though :)

In that case, it's ok. Because it's for the better of the community. See?

ZEPHYR FINALLY REVEALS THE ANCIENT LONG LOST SECRET OF THE BEST MIXER!!  Re: [sfraves] vestax is
good

Well, I'm glad that we came to the conclusion that Vestax mixers are in fact of good quality. 
Thanx, Giles :)  And thanx to all the other Vestax fans...  And to the other mixer fans too.

Please PLEASE do your homework, people, before you start talkin' $h!+ about equipment you're not
very familiar with.  Just because you may think the bare bones model of a mixer brand sucks
doesn't mean that all of the other models suck too.  This is called STEREOTYPING.  All bare bones
models have their shortcomings, so I could say that they ALL SUCK, but I'm not like that.

Well, my advice to all the mixer shoppers is...

Get the most bang for your buck.  Save as much money as you can, or beg, borrow and steal...  Do
whatever you gotta do to get the best mixer you can possibly afford.  You get what you pay for
usually.  Look online for deals on new and used mixers.  Check out the stores to see if they have
any returns/floor models they wanna get rid of.  Just because a mixer is returned doesn't mean
it's broken.  Maybe a broke-dick DJ realized that he couldn't make rent for that month if he kept
the mixer, so he sent it back.  Look in the papers for ads-- a lotta deejays or wanna-be deejays
wash out and sell their equipment.  It could be due to loss of interest of lack of funds for
bills.

And if you really wanna know the secret of the best mixer brand...  The best mixer is... *drum
roll*








...THE ONE YOU LIKE MOST AND ARE MOST COMFORTABLE WITH!!  You could buy the most expensive high
quality mixer in the world, but if it doesn't "feel" right in YOUR hands, guess what!  You're not
gonna practice on it!!  And what use is a mixer that you don't use and practice on?  USELESS! 
(Well, maybe you can use it as an expensive paper weight)  Go to your friends' houses and get on
their mixers, go to the stores and demo the floor models...  Happy shopping!

Hola hello bonjour,

My name is Soul kid Jr a DeeJay coming from Geneva and staying a
couple of monthe in this Dramatically extraordinair city that is SF
sorry for my FrEn-Glish.... (that's to be polite prenting me)

European Dee Jay are looking forward to see choice from US
Turntablist MASTERs..... those one have there own Sponsorship brand
or whatever you call it vestax is one of the most active in the
field. BUT BUT BUT aggreeding with ZEPHYRHAWAI... vestax is for
beginner wanna be or Hip hop deejay(I m resigned to said that the
cross fader stay one of the best in terme of price and quality)

After a chat online withe Franois Kavorkian(Waves) and Miguel
Migs(Naked Records) Professional choices are really mitigate.

Depinding on what you want to do and looking on budget. The only
thing to remember is BACK TO SIMPLE ANALOGICAL MIXER forget soudn
effect directely on the mixer..... three brand are really apprecited
from our masters of the master RANE ( Little louis Vega, Ministry of
sound etc...)
http://www.rane.com/mp2016.html

 "Urei" for purist or Bozak
http://space.tin.it/musica/fcoletti/bozak_rare.htm

My last words would be, "look after the quality of the sound and a
mixer nerver would do your JOB guy's...."

Subject: [sfraves] traktor 2.0 dj studio w/ m-audio oxygen-8 *wow*

going by a sugestion from a guy on socal-breaks, i decided to wire in my
oxygen-8 as a controller for my laptop/traktor setup. holy wow is it neat!
i'm still getting the hang of the controls and tweaking the device mappings,
but i must say, i've been playing for the last hour with one turntable and a
laptop and it's becoming more and more easy the more i play with it.

it's pretty damn easy to setup, u can actually use /any/ midi controler. i
use the o8 bcuz: it's usb, my laptop has no midi in, it's small, it has lots
of knobs. to set it up in traktor you just click 'learn' on the master
window, select your midi device, and go through the list of actions to
configure, and 'learn' them from your controller. the one's i'm using the
most are 'pitch', 'pitch fine', 'track forward', 'track back', and the other
'digital' speed fx.

according to the traktor-dj.com forums, there's even a guy out of germany
that's building a complete midi dj mixer for use with traktor (looks just
like a generic technic mixer, only cooler). 

anyway, hopefully i'll have enough practice to debut this setup at incognita
this thursday, so if you swing by, i'll give you a looksee.

i hope everyone is continuing to enjoy themselves at the numerous local events that are being put on every single night in the bay area....events that are free of the troubles you might have experienced in the past at music venues....you can read about some of the things that happen here on this list...don't loose the party momentum that you gained over your positive experiences over the holidays :).....i am a very creative person, and most of the techie people can see that....i am glad to share my gifts, if even briefly, to help people to keep their attention spans up, if that is the case, as more often than not it is...:) cheers to any tech heads who think that people like me are "aliens" "strange" or even "wierd"...i know that means that you care and that you notice our differences and even appreciate them...i like working with computer people very much....anyway, something else that some people might not know yet, so i will tell you, is that  if you post to the list, you will probably be placed on a few lists of people who feel that you might match up well with their target crowd. this has been my experience...that and maybe you might receive some interesting information regarding music, art and  dance from all parts of the globe. sfraves is a wonderful resource for all sorts of goodies. you might even meet your soulmate here. :)

Well, there was "disco,"  the commercial stuff that most people associate=20

actually you shouldn't really be adjusting the gains even if you can find
them. adjusting the gains is an emergency measure best excluded from
mission-critical applications.

Subject: [sfraves] early electro!! stoked!!!/Re: Later...

I just figured out this morning that two records I hadn't been able to
classify were in fact early electro.

today I'm gonna post my eBay links, so, if any of y'all want some early
electro - and I mean like pre-1985 - you'll know where to find it.

however, after that, I'm following Mr. Bispo's lead. sfraves appeals far too
well to my vices. I could easily sit here rabbitting on all day and
accomplishing nothing. it is time to heed the words of the King: "a little
less conversation, a little more action."

not I, but for what it's worth, Sao Paolo has more people in it than New
York. Layo and Bushwhacka! debuted their live show there a few months ago.

I once had a girlfriend from Sao Paolo. she was gorgeous, but things between
us were often a bit enigmatic, because she didn't speak English. luckily I
learnt some Portuguese.

the only words I remember now are "princess" and "kiss."

in retrospect, that relationship did not actually make a lot of sense.

the amazing thing is this: not only was she not the first girl who spoke no
English that I hit on successfully, she wasn't even the first girl from
South America who spoke no English that I hit on successfully. that honor
goes to a beautiful blonde Argentinian I met on a bus in Oakland, who agreed
(using hand motions, mostly) to go on a date with me.

anyway, Urb ran a feature on Brazil a little while back. they might have
something on their web site.

I guess the commercial stuff in each genre almost always gives it a bad name
to the non-enthusiasts after the  trend is over, eh?  In the meantime, I
guess I'll try to find a funk night with maybe a house spin. I spent the
last couple of years merely bobbing my head, trainspotting, appreciating DJ
talent, and intellectualizing the track selections - this year, I just wanna
get out and shake my ass.

actually you shouldn't really be adjusting the gains even if you can
find
them. adjusting the gains is an emergency measure best excluded from
mission-critical applications.

it might even be wise to rewire the gains so that the only way to adjust
them without getting electrocuted would be to turn off the mixer first.

Subject: [sfraves] Last night:  'clowns'  (short review)

Wow, I had such a good time at that GodDamn Clowns party last night. One of 
the things that I love about sfraves is the spontaneity that arises when 
you happen to read a last-minute BSP and something clicks (besides your 
mouse).

I mean, I had a feeling that this was going to be an East bay event, so I 
called the info line and dragged my ass over to one of the warehouse 
districts of Oakland. Found a parking spot, walked down the street and ran 
into my good friend Evan, whom I have not seen in ages. He is still working 
and going to school, so we talked and then went inside the space to dance.

Inside, the DJ was in a "pit" below the main floor, which was decorated 
with wild clown pictures. And the clowns themselves were everywhere, some 
of them half-naked (like a guy in a thong outfit, with a whip). Picture an 
S&M clown. Later there was some clown spankings going on but I did not 
participate in the fun (just watched on the sidelines).

Some of Evan's other friends told me that they always see me at these 
undergrounds, like the Moksha tribe parties. Lucky me, I guess I have 
learned how to figure out the underground since I am a dancer, seeking the 
best beat.

The space also had a large chill room (behind the main room), and a 
secondary refreshment/chill room behind that room. Plus, there was a "fun 
house" room, decked out with mirrors and strobe lights (and black paint), 
so it was groovy, baby. This room was more like a long hallway, actually, 
and it did not seem to get used as much as it could have. But I enjoyed the 
strobe lighting effect.

I got tired at around 2 am, from all of that dancing, and I had to leave so 
I said goodbye to Evan. He was sitting beside an Asian woman in the chill 
room, and I guess she thought I was cute or something because she asked for 
my phone number (and asked if I had a girlfriend). I could not understand 
her English, so I said, "No" and pretended to understand the rest of the 
conversation.

She walked away and left us alone, and the highlight of my night was when 
Evan said, "It wouldn't be a party without you here, Greg," which made me 
feel really happy. Then he showed me his color phone, and punched my number 
into his address book.

That's all, I just wanted to tell my story. It was great fun.

Greg VP

    I know that guy- he spins ambient, I think. I can't remember his name
though.

back to the subject at hand...gene simmons of the band
KISS...the man who wears a lot of black and white

kind of afraid of in a "who is ozzy osbourne too? i am
scared of those pictures in sixteen magazine that i am
looking at after church on sunday with my family while
we are shopping at the grocery store for eggo waffles"
sort of way...gene simmons has a magazine out now
called "tongue". you should read that magazine...it is
a lot of fun....they probably have it at the record
store or at a big newsstand that carries lots of
magazines...probably not at the grocery store, because
jenna (porn star jenna) is on the cover and there is a
good interview with her in there amongst lots of other
coolness, like a muscle girls wall calender.....okay,
bye. :)

Actually, I bought this magazine just for the jenna jameson poster. The 
content itself in it sucks ass, but they've got some great photos.

Yes...great film.  I've thought long and hard about my intense dislike for 
clowns and, after recently reviewing "Dumbo," I believe this bias 
originated there.  Very dark work in many ways....

It was a damn good time, agreed.  Aside from some struggle to get the
turntables to do what I wanted them to (skippy needles - must bring my own
carts if I intend to goof off at all), it was a good underground
reminiscent of some of the really small UGs I fell in love with in SF a
few years back.  Thoughtful decor, good people, Mike dropping "we like the
cars" and um... half naked clowns wearing fetish gear whipping each
other in the hallway.

How can you go wrong with Ouchy, $1.50 Rockstar, and a ton of people I
haven't seen in a while.  The crew executed a safe, fun event with
shitloads of class and creativity...

Here in Mallorca we just had a blinding weekend, the New Years Eve 
hangovers 
had faded sufficiently for everyone to be firing an all cylinders 
again. I 
was first invited to the staff party for the Country Club, which was a 
beautiful traditional meal & piss up in one of the mountain 
restaurants. At 
about 2am we made it to Made in Brazil, for a bit of sexy dancing with 
the 
admin dept. The club's dancers make you learn the routines they have 
made up 
for that week, its hip wrigglin, saucy line dancin done the latin way, 
and we 
raved it up enough to all be pretty embarressed this morning!  After 
that a 
quick trip to the Torino in Ca'n Barbara to hear dj Cannus finishing 
his set. 
KIDSTUFF / KOMISKI PARK / HONCHOS  NRK was playing as we stumbled in, 
and 
after the main crowd had left, the staff came out from behind the bar 
for a 
dance to that Dirty Vegas track.We wont play it in the set, but we love 
it 
for its out and out rudeness. At 5am we made it to Pacha where I heard 
a 
blinding set by dj Sarah Maine who is the Ibiza resident. She was 
presenting 
the Winter Session tour and had us all going hammer & tongs on the 
pista..the 
best thing about Pacha? People actually dancing together, girls & boys 
getting it on! After such a good night it was impossible to lay down so 
it 
was time to forget those new years resolutions and head up to the 
afters, 
Club 64 where dj Silvio Dee from Italy twists and spins until the late 
afternoon. A lot of faces, handshakes, the odd scary moment ( I 
remembered 
with a shudder late on Sunday evening how I stopped a Morroccon head 
butting 
the crew who took a bit too long in the bogs by grabbing his necks 
scruff ) 
but most importantly loud twisted house that makes you forget about all 
that 
shit, and throw your hands up! Thanks to all the dj's, producers, and 
beverage companies for making it such a great weekend.

I guess the commercial stuff in each genre almost always gives it a bad name
to the non-enthusiasts after the trend is over, eh? In the meantime, I
guess I'll try to find a funk night with maybe a house spin. I spent the
last couple of years merely bobbing my head, trainspotting, appreciating DJ
talent, and intellectualizing the track selections - this year, I just wanna
get out and shake my ass.

At the risk of feeding a troll, let me say this: Disco was a part of gay
culture *long* before '79. Being gay certainly wasn't "mainstream" in
those days, either. Read up:

> no offense, my dad was a disco dj in new yaaaawk.

Riiiight... if anything, that only seems to have made you biased toward
the "mainstream gays" that "picked up" the genre. If it weren't for all
those crazy "gays", a lot of us wouldn't be here, doing what we do (in
the bay area, raving). Show some friggin' respect.

My Dear Mr. Throats,

Read my House History 101 or any other history of disco and the origins of 
EDM.  Disco began in the gay subculture and then was adopted in mainstream 
clubs.  And I was there in New Yaaaawk too.  Give your dad my best:)

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] Online Vinyl Shops

I know this question comes up periodically... Now it's my turn, since I lost
my bookmarks at work and have some time on my hands to shop.

Can anyone recommend some online record stores that stock vinyl?  Preferably
in the US since I hate waiting too long for shipments. I primarily buy
house, but the broader the selection, the better.

Thanks!

Just a note regarding online shops... if you're patient, or looking for
stuff that didn't just come out, you can special order at most local
shops.

A lot of local record stores are sufferring due to competition with these
sites.  Two years it still wasn't that bad as stores still had event
ticket sales supporting them, but please buy at least some of your stash
at the local shops and keep some of the last remaining centers of dance
music culture around.

Oh, I totally agree.. I buy most of my stuff locally. I was just bored at
work, and the Evil Conglomeration of Credit Card Companies=81 finds work for
idle hands ;)

For those of you who are into non-EDM vinyl (i.e. just old albums & stuff) =
I
discovered Record Man in Redwood City yesterday. I walked in and was
unimpressed by the store, until they showed me the additional rooms of
records they had - tons of rock & jazz. This place is like the Jedi Freakin
Archives of old wax. Great for you diggers out there!

I admit I haven't tried this.  Is special ordering through 
Solid Grooves comparable in price to buying vinyl at 
online shops with big back catalogues?

The biggest reason I have for going online is it's 
relatively inexpensive.  Most records are $10 online vs. 
$11 in-store... not a big deal by itself, but if you buy 
from an out-of-state online shop you avoid sales tax, and 
three of the four shops I listed waive shipping if your 
order exceeds from $50 (Dance Records) to $75 (Global 
Beats).  I don't even drive up to Skills anymore because I 
figure the cost to me in gas just adds a few more bucks to 
the cost of those pricey imports.

Of course I'm sure my aversion to Skills meets with a bit 
of your approval, Andy.  LOL, only kidding.  ;-)

I do stop by Solid Grooves from time to time to bug Keith 
or pick up some records when I'm on an impulse buying 
kick.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Online Vinyl Shops

Andy,

What 'local' shops do you recommend? I have dj'ed for almost 2 years, hate 
paying for the shipping charges; But, they have what I want.

I wouldn't mind waiting to get the records, via special order, but, where 
can I go?

I am looking for shops that cater to progressive/tribal/tech.

tweakin, solid grooves, housewares, open mind... it really doesn't matter.
find out what distributors carry the stuff you want and request that your
favorite shops carry them.  if you give them feedback, and you're
seriously buying the stuff you order, they'll work with you!  hell, i've
got it worked out that i pick what i want at solid, and then they let me
needle drop each track on the monitors they have there... which helps me
determine which records are gonna sound good on a bigger system.  you
can't really do that with a low quality mp3 on your computer.  you can't
tell a lot of other stuff buying on line either... even little things like
whether the track is cut at 33 or 45 really matter (i want 33 rpm records
for tricks, but 45 records sound better for banging hard stuff with solid
bass, etc).

Townshend arrested in porn inquiry Jan 14 2003




The Western Mail - The National Newspaper Of Wales


ROCK legend Pete Townshend was last night arrested by police in connection 
with child pornography offences.

The 57-year-old Who star, who admitted paying to access a website 
advertising child pornography but claimed it was purely for re-search 
purposes, was escorted by officers to a south-west London police station 
where he is currently in custody.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said, "He has been arrested under the Protection 
of Children Act 1978 on suspicion of possessing indecent images of 
children, suspicion of making indecent images of children and on suspicion 
of incitement to distribute indecent images of children."

The spokesman said that a number of items, including computers, had been 
removed from the residential address for forensic examination.

Townshend, whose home was searched by police officers, admitted using his 
credit card on one occasion to view a site advertising child porn "purely 
to see what was there" and insisted he was not a paedophile.

 with the risk of feeding fools who only read one thing on the net and don't live it. 
let me say that my dad was a disco dj back then  and the gay thing was pretty miniscule acording to his words. in fact non exsistant until later with knukles and leavan.

At the risk of feeding a troll, let me say this: Disco was a part of gay
culture *long* before '79. Being gay certainly wasn't "mainstream" in
those days, either. Read up:

Riiiight... if anything, that only seems to have made you biased toward
the "mainstream gays" that "picked up" the genre. If it weren't for all
those crazy "gays", a lot of us wouldn't be here, doing what we do (in
the bay area, raving). Show some friggin' respect.

my dad was a dj bro. not a gay club goer. lol  disco started out as a rebellion against rock n roll not a gay lifestyle. talk to the one's that created the scene not the 79' lemmings. 
youre more than welcome to spin that the rainbow world was the scene but like i said the people that actually created the scene didn't really care for the later gay section of the disco world.
know your role

My Dear Mr. Throats,

Read my House History 101 or any other history of disco and the origins of 
EDM. Disco began in the gay subculture and then was adopted in mainstream 
clubs. And I was there in New Yaaaawk too. Give your dad my best:)

Love,

Apollo

Please note the following with an open mind:

1. Disco has been around since at least 1973, evidenced by music articles
written at the time by national magazines which refer to a new style of
music called "disco." Additionally, the classic disco tune "Never Gonna Give
You Up" by Barry White was on the music charts that same year.

2. Disco did not die in 1979. True, it was critically wounded on several
counts that year and unquestionably past it's prime, but it wasn't dead.
Some of disco's biggest and greatest tunes were released in 1979; "I Will
Survive" by Gloria Gaynor, "Ring My Bell" by Anita Ward, "We Are Family" by
Sister Sledge, "Hot Stuff/Bad Girls" by Donna Summer, "Born To Be Alive" by
Patrick Hernandez - to name a few. The following year saw massive disco hits
by Blondie, Irene Cara, Diana Ross, and Kool & The Gang - to name a few.

3. Your implication that because something died it was therefore picked up
by the gays is homophobic on so many levels. Incidentally, "the gays"
involvement in disco pre-dates 1979 by a long shot.

4. Your other implication that what constitutes "mainstream" are dead things
that "the gays" "pick up" is illogical from a grammatical point of view and
absurd from a socially historical point of view.

No offense.

unless you dj'd or knew someone personally who helped create the scene(like my dad), back in the early days of disco, not the later days, then all you're really doing is biting on the scene and trying to make it for what it was not.  i.e. a gay scene. 
it was a party scene for sure, drugs, sex etc. but to say it started as a gay scene as the forefront is really naive. i don't blame some of you for thinking that way because you follwed knuckles and laven. but newsflash, they didn't create the scene. 
take care

Yeah? Well my dad is bigger than your dad, and I know everything MY dad says
is right, because there's no one bigger, stronger, smarter, or cooler than
my dad. Did you know my dad played football for the Polk High School
football team? That's right. The team that won the Cook County, Illinois
sectional championship in '67. My dad INVENTED the 4-man blitz with his
buddies on the defensive line. You know why? Because he's so big, strong,
smart, and cool, that everything he says is right, especially when he's
talking about football. So that makes me an expert in football now. Go
ahead. Ask me anything. I know more than Madden.

  - omid  ::rolls eyes::


p.s. If disco went to the "mainstream lemmings" in 1979, as you say, how in
the hell could I have been grooving to KC & the Sunshine Band in freakin'
IRAN before I left there in '77?   Jackass.

*sigh*   I can see it now:

My Dad was a DJ back in the rave days. He mixed with Carl Cocks and Dan the
DJ. He could mix house into jungle and back. He invented the 303. He told m=
e
so!

All with a grain of salt. Think of what's up now. Think about it back then.




Loving this thread. Back when I was first throwing raves (many, many years
ago) I rented an old, closed down gay nightclub in San Diego. Had the best
set-up for dancing. Was awesome.

We went exploring into the back rooms. Found this old locked room. Didn't
know what it was. After a few weeks at this place, one of the managers came
through for something, opened up the door...

It was FILLED with old disco record. At least 10,000.

Very curious about that old room.

Hey everyone...

My name is Piper.

I try and read through all these posting at least once a week. I post very seldom unless I'm looking for a party to go to.

I started raving about 4 years ago, mostly underground......Worked at a club which used to shut down after hours and host raves until the wee hours of morning light. (about 4 a month) I have been to most of the clubs in Las Vegas and listened to tons of wild-ass remixes. Woo Hoo!!!

I was in San Francisco last month for business and had the opportunity to go to a little mexican restaurant/bar on 16th Street and met some of the crew from Elastique. I guess, after hours (10:00 p.m. -1:30 a.m.) on Wednesday nights they get Dj's to come in and spin.

It was quite a treat... the music was phenominally great and I had a blast. A couple of the guys even helped me with my sticks to get a better light trail.

Anyway.... I'm moving to the Sacramento area in March/April for work and I'm looking for a couple of different things:

1) A place to live that is party (raver) friendly and nice. (You know with all of the amenities, kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms, garage, etc...) Maybe, multiple bedrooms and I'll get room mates since I'll be there for about a year.

2) A place to party.... You know the one... without all the drama, just a place to hang out and get my groove on.

3) Good people to party with... YEP.... the ones without a lot of drama that know how to party and have respect for others, while still making sure everyone is safe and having a good time.

 

I know this is a lot to ask....... Way too much for a lot of people I've met in the past however, the older I get, the more faith I have in Humanity.

If you know of any of these things, PLEASE get back to me ASAP.

 

Thanks

 

Piper

Any chance your dad doesn't want you to picture his boyfriend blowing a crushed disco biscut up his ass?

MY Dad invented disco-polka-gabber before IT went mainstream... but he eventually caught "THE GAY" too... thank god that was the day after I was concieved...

That's why I don't hang out with people who have caught "THE GAY", it's more contagious than you might think.  Be careful.

In case you haven't been listening, Apollo here both dj'd and helped
"create the scene." (whatever that means) Sound like you've been raised

Last year you helped the Drug Policy Alliance stop the RAVE Act from
becoming law. This year supporters of the draconian drug war bill are
back with a vengeance. They have stopped calling it the "RAVE Act"
and have stuck its provisions in a popular omnibus domestic security
bill. This is a common Congressional ploy: put controversial bills
that can't go anywhere on their own into important bills, so that
Members of Congress are forced to vote for them.

Your help is needed to stop these disguised RAVE Act provisions from
becoming law!!!

The bill, S.22, is sponsored by Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD). The
troubling drug war provisions are in the section entitled "Crack
House Statute Amendments"

ACTIONS TO TAKE

*** Call your two Senators. You can contact your Senators through the
Capitol Switchboard at 202-224-3121. To find out who your Senators
are go to: http://www.senate.gov/senators/senator_by_state.cfm.
Tell them:

1) You oppose the "crack house statute" amendments in S.22.

2) These provisions are just like the provisions in the RAVE Act
last year.

3) The provisions would endanger public health, free speech, and
property rights.

4) Urge them to contact Daschle's office and work to get these
provisions removed from S.22.

** Fax Senator Daschle (even if he is not one of your two Senators).

To fax Senator Daschle go to:
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=1448.

** Please forward this action alert to your friends and family. The
Senate needs to know that voters find this bill unacceptable.
For more information on the RAVE Act and how the S. 22 "crack house"
provisions will affect public health, free speech, and property
rights see: http://www.nomoredrugwar.org/music/rave_act.htm

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Disco?


Give it 30 years.

Everyone will be swearing up and down that all those "gosh darn electronic
moozic deejays" were both homosexual and addicted to ecstasy, sometimes
gnoshing down upwards of eight pills a night.

Then someone will pipe in "Uh, I had a relative who spun house from
'95-00, and he wasn't gay. Furthermore, he was pointedly against the
widespread drug abuse in the scene."

And there will be a long ha ha my dad ha ha spiel in their futuristic
avatar-driven vmail, and someone will get pissed off and run someone else
over with their flying car. Or fly them over. Suck them into their
turbines, whatever. And little billy will be left an orphan.

An orphan. Can you bear that on your conscience?

You cannot make a blanket statement like 'disco was a 100% gay culture'
and expect to be taken any more seriously than Mr. Superdad over here.

I'd assume, as ravers, most of you would be more willing to trust word of
mouth than the mainstream media. I realize we're in SF and all, so this
kind of stuff gets kinda hyperbole... but come on, guys.

Next we're going to hear how everyone in the 80s was doing cocaine.
And was gay.
And owned a BMW.

Pfft. Does it even matter? :P

Quite true, but I don't think (by my cold medication-addled recollection)
that anyone said it was a 100% gay culture, or purely a product thereof.

On a point of semantics, whether or not the citations of mainstream media
are accurate, at least some people did take the time to try to back up their
claims (or refute Mr. Superdad's) with more than hearsay. And that's a hell
of a lot more than I can say for a lot of the opinions masquerading as facts
here, as well as on other culture-oriented mailing lists/boards.

Hi,
  Recently my crossfader on my mixer (Vestax 170A) began to crap out on me.  
It crackles and there is some noise bleed.  Can I just add some lubricant (ie 
Caig) to fix the problem or should I buy a replacement.  I have had the mixer 
for 3 years, and have not replaced the crossfader once.
                                                                              
   Thanks

Now, here's the real inside info on the origin of disco.

Some aliens were cruising about New Jersey one summer's eve, and decided to 
administer anal probes to several hundred hard-core rock fans at a local 
concert.  After that event, these "normal" folk started a shakin' and 
movin', throwin' their arms up in the air, wearin' polyester and chain, and 
began what the government in secret files called the "alien-probe 
conversion"  event.  Many were apparently affected by this probing, which 
it turns out, introduced some sort of contagious jitterbug virus into 
straight New Jersey folk who, when they crossed the bridge and tunnels into 
Manhattan, spread this virus to gays, African Americans, and other less 
"normal" people.  Soon all of New York, and the country, were infected with 
"Saturday Night Fever" virus, alien in origin.

So, yes, disco originated in straight former rock culture in New Jersey and 
spread into the dark corners of New York and beyond.

The government deliberately suppressed all this info, and rewrote history, 
including magazines, billboard top sellers, and culture rags to avoid mass 
hysteria.

Come on guys.  Seriously.  I don't think anyone believes disco was 100% 
gay, or whatever.  But, like many musical genres, disco originated in 
marginalized subcultures -- in this case, African American and gay -- and 
moved on into the mainstream.  This is undeniable fact, whether one is 
comfortable with it or not.  I sense underlying homophobia in some this 
discussion.

I admire dry throats' blind devotion to his father, but he can't even spell 
the names of some of the major players correctly and apparently has never 
investigated this part of musical history on his own.

Barry Lederer wrote me recently asking me if I was willing to write a more 
comprehensive history of disco, since he believes such a work is long 
overdue.  My focus has been on the origins of house music but when one 
hears some of the strange shit that begins to circulate over time I can see 
why some objective and comprehensive treatment is necessary.

Love,

Apollo

Dude!  I was there! I was outside of the Meadowlands, waiting to get into
the big, rockin, hetero Judas Priest show, and next thing you know, my
mullet became a 'fro, my leather pants a set of bell bottoms, and my muscle
shirt turned into this striped butterfly-collar number. A week later, I
bought a faux gold medallion the size of a manhole cover and a set of roller
skates. I shit you not, man! Thanks for reawakening these suppressed
memories, Apollo.

OK, looks like they dinn't waste any time.

Same as last year, call/write your Senator/Congressman to voice your
disapproval.

btw, this looks like a rider on another bill.

SR. 22 (108th Congress)

Part 4-Crack House Statute Amendments
   Sec. 5131. Offenses. Amends crack house statute (21 U.S.C. $B!x(B856) to make
it apply to those who (1) knowingly open, lease, rent, use or maintain a
place either permanently or temporarily for the purpose of manufacturing,
distributing or using any controlled substance and (2) manage or control any
place, whether permanently or temporarily, for the purpose of unlawfully
manufacturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance. These
changes clarify that the law applies not just to ongoing drug distribution
operations, but to ``single-event'' activities. This section also applies
the law to outdoor as well as indoor venues.

   Sec. 5132. Civil penalty and equitable relief for maintaining
drug-involved premises. Establishes the civil penalty for violating 21
U.S.C. $B!x(B856 as amended to either $250,000 or two times the gross receipts
that were derived from each violation of that section.

   Sec. 5133. Declaratory and injunctive remedies. Authorizes the Attorney
General to commence a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief for
violations of 21 U.S.C. $B!x(B856 as amended.

   Sec. 5134. Sentencing Commission guidelines. Requires the Sentencing
Commission to review Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to offenses
involving gammahydroxybutyric acid and consider amending Federal
sentencing guidelines to provide for increased penalties.

   Sec. 5135. Authorization of appropriations for a demand reduction
coordinator. Authorizes $5.9 million to the Drug Enforcement Administration
to hire a special agent in each State to coordinate demand reduction
activities.

   Sec. 5136. Authorization of appropriations for drug education. Authorizes

Subject: [sfraves] Re: In defense of/ Disco?

Regardless of where Disco originated from (and I believe Apollo's version 
sans alien embellishment;) there is no doubt about one thing when you 
consider the chronology of events, were it not for Disco, there would be no 
House, which means there would have been no raves.

It is unfortunate that Disco's name got so tarnished in the late 70's early 
80's thanks to the cookie cutter commercial mindless crap the labels started 
turning out, not unlike so much of rap music today. Someone recently gave 
props to the 70's disco hit by the Bee Gees Stayin' Alive. (Hats off to 
Maurice Gibb, rest in peace good brother)Well I'd like to add to the list. 
Pardon me as I reminisce. Who can deny the incredible songwriting talents of 
Nile Rodgers & Bernard Edwards from the group CHIC("I want your 
love","Forbidden Lover" - talk about a phat bassline), who also wrote and 
produced for the 70's hit group SISTER SLEDGE of "We are a family" fame. 
This was some of the best music ever written and performed, true disco - 
creative, heavy on musicianship, soulful, excellent arrangements, steeped in 
Rhythm and Blues.

Let's not forget PRINCE either. Most of you are too young to know this but 
PRINCE's early recordings were released in the 70's (ha, and you thought 
prince is 80's! Purple Rain, Red Corvette yada yada) If you can find it, 
check out the outro in the "Sexy Dancer" release in '78 -it's like listening 
to a House track. Hmmm come to think of it, I might just bust out that track 
at a party.  Like him or not, the man was ahead of his time and a genius.


Oh yeah, and so what if gays brought the World Disco. True Disco is amazing 
stuff, even if it got handed down by gay aliens;)


In defense of Disco.

Subject: [sfraves] FW: Peace marches this Saturday



(from Otto of Tiki News)

A friend of mine created this website and poster image to use for the
upcoming
peace rallies and future peace rallies as needed
I think it is pretty cool so I am now sharing it with you
____________________________________

In response to our government's apparent determination
to go to war with Irag, some friends and I have
created a website for distributing anti-war art on a
mass scale. Please check it out at
http://www.anotherposterforpeace.com/

If you like it, please do us all a favor and pass it
on.

As a citizen of the United States, I am deeply
concerned about where we are headed. Real patriots ask
questions: Does it make sense to attack a country over
what it MIGHT do in the future when we can easily
monitor such activities by satellite? What kind of a
precedent does this set for international relations?

Is this war really going to make us safer, or will a
pre-emptive strike anger Arab nations, making
terrorist acts against the U.S. more likely?

We MUST speak up and say this war is wrong. Using art
as a tool for public discussion is one way we can do
this. If enough of us print these posters out and put
them in our cars and windows, we can raise the level
of public awareness to the point where politicians
will HAVE to listen to us. If enough of us voice our
dissent, we will be heard.

Hi Adrian,

I would just buy a new crossfader. Three years is a long time.
De-Ox is what you want to use if you want to squeeze one or two more seasons
out of your cross fader. De-Ox is available under a generic name at Radio
Shack.

If you got the dough, buy the X-Fader, though. Electronics have a way of
giving out at the worst time.

World of stereo on Market can be the cheapest if you do some research and
check other stores prices. (google 'PSSL' for the definitive discount price
on all DJ gear)

Hi,
  Recently my crossfader on my mixer (Vestax 170A) began to crap out on me.
It crackles and there is some noise bleed.  Can I just add some lubricant
(ie
Caig) to fix the problem or should I buy a replacement.  I have had the
mixer
for 3 years, and have not replaced the crossfader once.

   Thanks

Actually, they have them in adult sizes at places like SportMart
super-cheap, and I believe Skechers is making them now, too... Come to think
of it, I need a pair of those to roll around the office with and build my
artist cred. The long hair and funny facial hair just isn't enough these
days.

They are ALL over in Japan. I saw kids riding them in
the streets, in alleys, on the train station
platforms, in trains (they seem to get a kick out of
the motion of the train on skates). I didn't see
anyone over the age of 12 in them, but if I did, I'd
have seen them in bars, in nightclubs, on the
dancefloor etc etc etc.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Disco?

Heh. I have here a magazine dated 1973 with some terrific pictures of mysel=
f
getting arrested at a New York Dolls concert on Halloween at the Waldorf
Astoria in NYC. All the cool straight people were into proto-punk and/or
glitter at the time.

Anyway, after being fingerprinted and released at the 19th Precinct after
promising never again to stand in the middle of a smoke bomb wearing silver
lam=E9 getting photographed in the Waldorf lobby, I grabbed a cab and went to
Le Jardin and ended up winning $25 in a costume contest. Le Jardin was most
definitely a gay disco in 1973. The Loft (from 1970!) and later Paradise
Garage were too. Ditto the Ice Palace in the city and better yet Fire
Island, along with the Monster and the Boatel. So was Studio 54--straight
people were welcome only as long as they were fabulous (and preferably
accompanied by beautiful young men) at least while it was in its glory
years. Of course after disco peaked in 1977, just about anyone got past the
door at Studio, and then Xenon opened and, well, ugh.

Apollo has it right. You can believe me (lol) because both my roommates wer=

gay men and one of them was Grace Jone's twin brother, who was a DJ at
Hurrahs. Jeez, ask Grace Jones about gay men belatedly "discovering" disco
in 1979.=20

That is  WHY they want to do this now.
They don't want us to think about the economy.
They don't want us to think  about this perpetual war they want to have.
They just want us to make us hate and fear whomever they say.
They deal in the very opposite of PLUR.
They will try to destroy anything that interferes with their 
hatemongering.

Why is it that they spend so much more effort trying to stop raves than 
gangs?
Why do they bust all of the Ecstasy, LSD and  pot, but let the  crank 
go through?
Why is it that even the most popular electronic dance music is almost 
never on the radio
but Eminem is all over it?

Full text of S.22 is available at

anywhere else except there and EMDEF.  Apparently the Senate/House Bills

Subject: [sfraves] Re: [nrr] ccsf, where are you? Thailand

Sawadi krub!

I go to CCSF too! Although, I am missing the first week of school because I am
educating myself here in Bangkok, trying to learn to speak Thai. Hopefully the
teachers won't drop me from my classes! :P I am learning a lot more about life
here in Thailand (in a National Geographic kind of way) than I think I will
learn this semester at school :) By the way if you come to Thailand make sure
to check out Ubon in esam (eastern Thailand) because it is straight-up country
livin' ;)

There aren't many of us SFRavers that go, to my knowledge. Hula Girl Julie
used to go there until she moved to Hawaii :( I also think Cocoa goes there
currently too. My ex goes there, but I don't think she's subscribed to this
list anymore. ;)

I'm taking two philosophy classes, a digital music class, and Swimming/Kung
Fu/Yoga, so I have quite the semester set up for myself!

Anyone else go to CCSF? Sometimes I feel like I'm bangin' my techno all alone
in the parking pits, and most of the lamers there listen to 92.7 which makes
me vom.

o.k anyway, phom pai lah!

Shoke di nah!

Subject: [sfraves] [nrr] climate changes disrupt birds - save the tits

"Shifts in spring temperatures in central Europe may be having a significant
effect on the ability of birds to breed successfully, say scientists.

While the full impact of climate change is not yet clear, some birds whose
populations rely on hatching two clutches of eggs a year may be hit hard."

favorite line:
"The research, covering two decades of data and published in a journal of
the Royal Society, looked at populations of great tits (Parus major) and
blue tits (Parus caeruleus)."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Crossfader help...

CaiLube can work wonders at times, but if you have serious bleed, it's
probably time for a new fader.  That sort of behavior speaks of wear,
the likes of which some lubrication isn't going to do much about.

But try it first- it's a lot cheaper than a new crossfader, and you'll
find other uses for it even if it doesn't do the trick on this
conundrum.

how could "disco" possibly have been getting "mainstreamed" in 1979, when 
"Fly Robin Fly" was a hit in 1975 and the Bee Gees' string of "disco" hits 
began in 1976?

If you mean the kind that don't require you to stop, and pop out the
wheels...

http://www.heelys.com/window.asp

otherwise you might have seen these:
http://www.streetflyers.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ExecMacro/home.d2w/report

Personally I like the heelys for being a normal looking skate shoe that with
a pivot of the ankle becomes a skate. It's eerie when you see kids at
parties with them. I'll never forget the Serenity party at Metreon where I
saw 3 kids just float across the ground and then stop and keep walking. I
keep thinking about getting a pair this spring when I start taking bart into
work more. The streetflyers just seem a bit ghetto to me. Too chunky of a
shoe and you have to stop and flip out your skates.

Heely's are at Copelands and are under $100 usually. Apollo also mentioned
Skates On Haight which is a great local shop. Used to buy all of my wheels
there back in the day!

Speaking of which -- have you guys seen those sneakers that all these kids

they're not new -- I remember seeing the boots years ago...

Anyone know if KB Toys sells them in adult sizes? :>

Kids get all the cool toys.

> Pfft. Does it even matter? :P

(No offence intended to disco's fans here... but ugh...)

Not really.  Disco is one of the few genres of music I can honestly say I have
no love for.  When someone spinning house starts to make it sound too much like
disco, I leave the room.  And I'm kinda glad I'm too young to have suffered
through the disco era.  (I kinda woulda liked to catch the last bit of the '60s
tho.  But then I would've had to go into hibernation for most of the '70s, and
wake back up during the days of punk rock (good music's rebellion against
disco), and '80s new wave.)

So nah... I wasn't there, and neither was, I'm sure, 99% of this list.  And it
all really DOES come down to trusting one person's word vs another (the hearsay
reported by another, actually).

First off tho, I don't remember Apollo ever claiming that everyone in the disco
scene was gay and there were no straight people there.  That'd be just silly. 
For example, there's a significant straight contingent that goes to Faith every
week.  Why would anyone claim or believe that it is different at New York
discos?!?!?

But even if he HAD claimed that the disco scene was 100% totally gay with no
exceptions; I'd be far more inclined to believe Apollo (who has a long history
of being one one of the most positive contributors to the list and the scense)
over some random homophobic bigot who appeared out of nowhere and started
trolling (and whose arguement, as others have pointed out, is bases all around
the "my dad can beat up your dad" theme).

It's just a matter of credibility.


cya,
john

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) ccsf...

i'm currently taking an evening italian class
downtown.  i hope to never have to go out to the
ingleside area though, except to get my application on
file and any other pesky details i have to do.  (i
lived out by city college for a while without a car,
and i'm not in a hurry to get back out there.)  

i'm actually a little nervous about taking classes
this semester (i've got a legal research class at
merritt, too), since it's been quite a while...

I think that once you wear them for a while you get used to the fact that
there IS a wheel there. However in the learning stages I can see some
hillarious and possbily tragic mishaps. The wheels do pop out easily
however. Keep them in your pocket for those nights out drinkin...

Now if they made a dressy club shoe with these... hmmm =)

Hey all, one of my good friends is going to be visiting me in about a month and he is a huge fan of jazz and blues. Being new to the area I'm not really sure if there are any late night jazz/blues bars in SF or in the area? Any help would be greatly appreciated =) 
Also, is there an area in SF for a bunch of drunk rednecks from KY to go barhopping? They aren't my friends, but they are visiting us on business so I figured that'd be the easiest way to entertain them =)

The more and more this thread goes on, I keep envisioning myself in a
"Goldmember"-esque scenario, rolling into a club on golden clog-skates...

Isn't that wwweeeird?

Ok, so who wants to put together a Roller-Disco party? It'd definitely have
to be UG, otherwise there'd be all sorts of liability/insurance issues. Damn
this litigious society!

You'll need the windows media player (ugh, I know). Mac users can
download it here:

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Disco?

I wore Heely's for a year straight, they're awesome..  At work, at
parties and clubs, everywhere. :)  They're wonderful but damn can it
hurt when you fall.  I probably knew the kids you're talking about at
serenity, unless they were really young.  The ones I'm thinking of look
early 20's but they're pushing 30+.

The way Heely's are designed are very non-intrusive.  I could jog in
them, dance in them etc with no problems.  Cracks in the streets and
sidewalks are what always posed my biggest problems, but I love crusin'
down Steiner comin' from Haight... That's about the perfect hill for
speed and safety.  Get goin' like 15 - 20 miles an hour :)

boom boom room (across from the fillmore, at

even been to shows that have gone on till almost 7am

there are some other venues downtown, but i'm not too

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Re: In defense of/ Disco?

And tag on in front of disco Ken Kesey's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Tests
which by all descriptions sound like some of the coolest raves I've ever
heard of (The Greatful Dead in small venues/broken into houses, with
people blissfully dancing in extasy anyone?) with an honorable mention
to Kraftwerk for creating the first drum machine and totally electronic
music ;)  Then we can go way back to the Theramin's invention..
Chronology is really amazing as to how many places back things can be
related to and where they spread from and combine again for a new genre.

Subject: [sfraves] Re: In defense of/ Disco?


Regardless of where Disco originated from (and I believe Apollo's
version 
sans alien embellishment;) there is no doubt about one thing when you 
consider the chronology of events, were it not for Disco, there would be
no 
House, which means there would have been no raves.

It is unfortunate that Disco's name got so tarnished in the late 70's
early 
80's thanks to the cookie cutter commercial mindless crap the labels
started 
turning out, not unlike so much of rap music today. Someone recently
gave 
props to the 70's disco hit by the Bee Gees Stayin' Alive. (Hats off to 
Maurice Gibb, rest in peace good brother)Well I'd like to add to the
list. 
Pardon me as I reminisce. Who can deny the incredible songwriting
talents of 
Nile Rodgers & Bernard Edwards from the group CHIC("I want your 
love","Forbidden Lover" - talk about a phat bassline), who also wrote
and 
produced for the 70's hit group SISTER SLEDGE of "We are a family" fame.

This was some of the best music ever written and performed, true disco -

creative, heavy on musicianship, soulful, excellent arrangements,
steeped in 
Rhythm and Blues.

Let's not forget PRINCE either. Most of you are too young to know this
but 
PRINCE's early recordings were released in the 70's (ha, and you thought

prince is 80's! Purple Rain, Red Corvette yada yada) If you can find it,

check out the outro in the "Sexy Dancer" release in '78 -it's like
listening 
to a House track. Hmmm come to think of it, I might just bust out that
track 
at a party.  Like him or not, the man was ahead of his time and a
genius.


Oh yeah, and so what if gays brought the World Disco. True Disco is
amazing 
stuff, even if it got handed down by gay aliens;)


In defense of Disco.

one small factual point: to my knowledge, all of the Acid Tests were held

willingly...there was never an Acid Test at a "broken-into house."

Actually, the 35th anniversary of the first Ken Kesey "Be In" in SF was a 
few days ago.  Ken was one wild, creative, crazy guy.

This weeks guest:
Dj Dub (D.E.N. Entertainment [Sac] / Faze Frequency)

    Dub began spinning in the winter of '99 and has been developing his
skills as an up and comer in the Northern California scene.  His taste for
house, and the progressive side of music, was inspired by such big names as
DJ Dan and John Digweed.  Dub likes his house deep and progressive and his
sets are just that, with trippy blends of spacey sounds and tribal beats.
Dub keeps the energy of his sets on the same wavelength as his style,
progressive, constantly pushing the people on the dance floor forward.  The
roller-coaster ride of a DJ Dub set is nothing to miss out on, he keeps the
groove locked and the beats rocking.

      YOU HAVE HEARD HIM AT:
     Till Dawn and Beyond('00), Palindromes('01), Block Party('02), Jamaica
House Residency('01-'02) Reggetechplosion (12.15.02)

      FUTURE RELEASES:
     Stay tuned for the single "Levitated" the first of many releases to
come from this talented progressive house dj, due out in Mid 2003.

Up in Oregon my friends put together a party called Rave 'n' Roll and it was
held at an old rollerskate ring, donald glaude hauled ass from Seattle to
Eugene just to get there and play at 6am.  probably one of the best parties
i've ever been to.  the vibe was incredible, and there aint nothing like
watching people walk around outside in roller skates to smoke...then try to
walk back up the stairs to go dance...hehehe.  luckily there were no
injuries and there were some people there who could incorperate
liquid/popping and roller skating into and insanely beautiful dance.

 Used to be a weekly back in 2000, maybe 2001 (?). Here's one of their
old notices ( thanks to Google ):

 "Tuesday, December 19th 2000
Technostate and Mad Hatter present Mad Jam
@ the Bench and Bar, 120 11th Street, Downtown Oakland - DJ's TBA - The
Mad Hatter is a weekly event put together by Technostate, TechnoFetish,
LFC, and Overworld"

 Some folks from Cloud Factory and Urban Wasteland were also involved.

Subject: [sfraves] new poster kinda bio

Folks,

I'm new to sfraves and I've been reading the past couple of week's 
mailings. Raver culture, in particular, embraces much of the
fun and joy that has departed from the post-modern world. Who wants to 
live in a world of dot.com 70 hour/week jobs? Not me,
been there - done that.

I've found so much helpful info on sfraves and corresponded with a 
couple of helpful souls - thanks for the pointers to free music,
raver resources, events, clubs, djs, etc. - and the generally 
cooperative energies that I've observed and experienced.
It's nice to see PLUR practiced.

Apollo's description/history of disco resonates well with me, a nearly 
49 y/o gay man who came out when disco was in its ascension. (And,
yeeeeessssss, I'm still dancing my butt off, thankyouverymuch.)

[mini-soap box:ON]

Having said that, I guess it is strange to hear things like 'so what 
if?' and things said that seem to mimic much of the racist and
homophobic comments made about disco and disco-influenced contemporary 
culture during conservative America's 'disco sucks' crap.

As a Southerner who grew up as a musician in a culture with a strong 
folk music tradition, both Celtic-American and African-American,
the first disco I heard was either in African-American churches or from 
African-American choirs and later wholeheartedly embraced
by Celtic-American Southerners. Disco's roots are without doubt a 
synthesis between these musical traditions, laced with bass and rhythm.
The music is compelling and provocative and was embraced quickly and 
broadly by underground clubs - gay bars in large numbers and
other venues, too. So-called black music that energized and united a 
sexual minority: a revolutionary experience, truly. Makes you wonder
why large, largely white-owned record companies wanted disco dead, 
doesn't it?

At any rate, I find that that these experiences make me appreciate 
techno, goa, house/progressive house/disco, and
raver music, generally, as a true love of music and dance. EDM 
generally is interesting, in a different and musical way. Seems that 
people who
dismiss a single genre without trying to consider for themselves 
whether/not they either appreciate or like it or both miss out on some 
truly
great stuff.

[mini-soap box:OFF]

Thanks for reading this queer's 2c worth.

Opinion

January 15, 2003

The United States of America has gone mad
John le Carr



America has entered one of its periods of historical madness, but this is
the worst I can remember: worse than McCarthyism, worse than the Bay of Pigs
and in the long term potentially more disastrous than the Vietnam War. The
reaction to 9/11 is beyond anything Osama bin Laden could have hoped for in
his nastiest dreams. As in McCarthy times, the freedoms that have made
America the envy of the world are being systematically eroded. The
combination of compliant US media and vested corporate interests is once
more ensuring that a debate that should be ringing out in every town square
is confined to the loftier columns of the East Coast press.

The imminent war was planned years before bin Laden struck, but it was he
who made it possible. Without bin Laden, the Bush junta would still be
trying to explain such tricky matters as how it came to be elected in the
first place; Enron; its shameless favouring of the already-too-rich; its
reckless disregard for the world's poor, the ecology and a raft of
unilaterally abrogated international treaties. They might also have to be
telling us why they support Israel in its continuing disregard for UN
resolutions.

But bin Laden conveniently swept all that under the carpet. The Bushies are
riding high. Now 88 per cent of Americans want the war, we are told. The US
defence budget has been raised by another $60 billion to around $360
billion. A splendid new generation of nuclear weapons is in the pipeline, so
we can all breathe easy. Quite what war 88 per cent of Americans think they
are supporting is a lot less clear. A war for how long, please? At what cost
in American lives? At what cost to the American taxpayer's pocket? At what
cost - because most of those 88 per cent are thoroughly decent and humane
people - in Iraqi lives?

How Bush and his junta succeeded in deflecting America's anger from bin
Laden to Saddam Hussein is one of the great public relations conjuring
tricks of history. But they swung it. A recent poll tells us that one in two
Americans now believe Saddam was responsible for the attack on the World
Trade Centre. But the American public is not merely being misled. It is
being browbeaten and kept in a state of ignorance and fear. The carefully
orchestrated neurosis should carry Bush and his fellow conspirators nicely
into the next election.

Those who are not with Mr Bush are against him. Worse, they are with the
enemy. Which is odd, because I'm dead against Bush, but I would love to see
Saddam's downfall - just not on Bush's terms and not by his methods. And not
under the banner of such outrageous hypocrisy.

The religious cant that will send American troops into battle is perhaps the
most sickening aspect of this surreal war-to-be. Bush has an arm-lock on
God. And God has very particular political opinions. God appointed America
to save the world in any way that suits America. God appointed Israel to be
the nexus of America's Middle Eastern policy, and anyone who wants to mess
with that idea is a) anti-Semitic, b) anti-American, c) with the enemy, and
d) a terrorist.

God also has pretty scary connections. In America, where all men are equal
in His sight, if not in one another's, the Bush family numbers one
President, one ex-President, one ex-head of the CIA, the Governor of Florida
and the ex-Governor of Texas.

Care for a few pointers? George W. Bush, 1978-84: senior executive, Arbusto
Energy/Bush Exploration, an oil company; 1986-90: senior executive of the
Harken oil company. Dick Cheney, 1995-2000: chief executive of the
Halliburton oil company. Condoleezza Rice, 1991-2000: senior executive with
the Chevron oil company, which named an oil tanker after her. And so on. But
none of these trifling associations affects the integrity of God's work.

In 1993, while ex-President George Bush was visiting the ever-democratic
Kingdom of Kuwait to receive thanks for liberating them, somebody tried to
kill him. The CIA believes that "somebody" was Saddam. Hence Bush Jr's cry:
"That man tried to kill my Daddy." But it's still not personal, this war.
It's still necessary. It's still God's work. It's still about bringing
freedom and democracy to oppressed Iraqi people.

To be a member of the team you must also believe in Absolute Good and
Absolute Evil, and Bush, with a lot of help from his friends, family and
God, is there to tell us which is which. What Bush won't tell us is the
truth about why we're going to war. What is at stake is not an Axis of
Evil - but oil, money and people's lives. Saddam's misfortune is to sit on
the second biggest oilfield in the world. Bush wants it, and who helps him
get it will receive a piece of the cake. And who doesn't, won't.

If Saddam didn't have the oil, he could torture his citizens to his heart's
content. Other leaders do it every day - think Saudi Arabia, think Pakistan,
think Turkey, think Syria, think Egypt.

Baghdad represents no clear and present danger to its neighbours, and none
to the US or Britain. Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, if he's still
got them, will be peanuts by comparison with the stuff Israel or America
could hurl at him at five minutes' notice. What is at stake is not an
imminent military or terrorist threat, but the economic imperative of US
growth. What is at stake is America's need to demonstrate its military power
to all of us - to Europe and Russia and China, and poor mad little North
Korea, as well as the Middle East; to show who rules America at home, and
who is to be ruled by America abroad.

The most charitable interpretation of Tony Blair's part in all this is that
he believed that, by riding the tiger, he could steer it. He can't. Instead,
he gave it a phoney legitimacy, and a smooth voice. Now I fear, the same
tiger has him penned into a corner, and he can't get out.

It is utterly laughable that, at a time when Blair has talked himself
against the ropes, neither of Britain's opposition leaders can lay a glove
on him. But that's Britain's tragedy, as it is America's: as our Governments
spin, lie and lose their credibility, the electorate simply shrugs and looks
the other way. Blair's best chance of personal survival must be that, at the
eleventh hour, world protest and an improbably emboldened UN will force Bush
to put his gun back in his holster unfired. But what happens when the
world's greatest cowboy rides back into town without a tyrant's head to wave
at the boys?

Blair's worst chance is that, with or without the UN, he will drag us into a
war that, if the will to negotiate energetically had ever been there, could
have been avoided; a war that has been no more democratically debated in
Britain than it has in America or at the UN. By doing so, Blair will have
set back our relations with Europe and the Middle East for decades to come.
He will have helped to provoke unforeseeable retaliation, great domestic
unrest, and regional chaos in the Middle East. Welcome to the party of the
ethical foreign policy.

There is a middle way, but it's a tough one: Bush dives in without UN
approval and Blair stays on the bank. Goodbye to the special relationship.

I cringe when I hear my Prime Minister lend his head prefect's sophistries
to this colonialist adventure. His very real anxieties about terror are
shared by all sane men. What he can't explain is how he reconciles a global
assault on al-Qaeda with a territorial assault on Iraq. We are in this war,
if it takes place, to secure the fig leaf of our special relationship, to
grab our share of the oil pot, and because, after all the public
hand-holding in Washington and Camp David, Blair has to show up at the
altar.

"But will we win, Daddy?"

"Of course, child. It will all be over while you're still in bed."

"Why?"

"Because otherwise Mr Bush's voters will get terribly impatient and may
decide not to vote for him."

"But will people be killed, Daddy?"

"Nobody you know, darling. Just foreign people."

"Can I watch it on television?"

"Only if Mr Bush says you can."

"And afterwards, will everything be normal again? Nobody will do anything
horrid any more?"

"Hush child, and go to sleep."

Last Friday a friend of mine in California drove to his local supermarket
with a sticker on his car saying: "Peace is also Patriotic". It was gone by
the time he'd finished shopping.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: DJ Darque on An Epiphany Of Sound

Hey there,
Today on An Epiphany Of Sound we're bringing you a truck load of funky
house, supplied by DJ/Producer DJ Darque.  He's a bit of a traveler,
beginning his DJ career in Dallas 6 years ago, then moving to Oklahoma
City, Chicago, L.A., and now the bay area, continuously spreading his
funky house vibe.  His favorite spot?  Chicago.  So you know his sound.
:)

As for production, he's been writing music for 3 years under the name
Soul Grabber, with his new album Mind Blowing in the pipeline.  10 of
his songs are online here:
http://www.soundclick.com/bands/7/soulgrabber.htm
So take a listen, check out his songs after the show, and look for him
out and about.

We'll also be giving you a BUNCH of chances to get on numerous different
guestlists, so write down 650-723-9010 so you can call in and win.

Talk to you.

Subject: [sfraves] [nrr] Book clouds and echo chambers


 From a guest blogger's link on boingboing.net ,

 People read books that reinforce their political beliefs much more
than books that challenge their beliefs (duh) :

 http://www.orgnet.com/leftright.html

 Given human nature, people's book buying habits are almost a given,
but it's interesting to see it reflected in actual research data.

 Have you challenged your beliefs recently ?

no, not really... let me explain....i don't think that an genuine belief changes. if you believe something, then you believe it, that is why it is a belief and not a theory of some sort..i don't really believe much..i do almost believe that i will die..actually, i pretty much accept that most of my body will die, but i am not sure of the spirit...there are mysteries, i suppose...there are also all sorts of preservatives out there and innovations to make sure that i can be around for when walt disney wakes up again...:)

He's got a good point, not enough people read opposing views, they like
to read the same views and get riled up about others.  Right now I'm
reading a far umm.... Well, far-left and far-right are the two main
parties... Would it be dark green for the green party?  Anyways, Running
on Emptiness: The Failure of Symbolic Thought is what I'm reading right
now.  While I don't believe a lot of what he says can or should happen,
he poses a lot of great points about things I haven't thought of before.
He's all about abandoning technology and going back to our primitive
roots without a centralized government or even society...  But at the
same time he's kinda hypocritical in the fact he has a pretty decently
designed website and still uses paper for books ;)  But, he's got to get
his message out there somehow to the masses and what he goes against is
what he has to use to get it out there.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [nrr] Book clouds and echo chambers

Marshal McLuhan said that people read advertisements not to decide what to
buy but rather to confirm the appropriateness of purchases they've already
made.  While it is important to remember that much of what McLuhan wrote and
said was presented in the form of poetic aphorisms to stimulate thought, it
is true that many people read ads for products or general product categories
that they already own.

They do this simply to confirm that the items that they own fit their self
image, desired socio-economic status, political viewpoint, etc.  Documented
examples include automobiles, clothes, and liquor.  In this context it is
not particularly surprising that people read political articles, books, etc.
which confirm their existing belief systems whether those happen to be
leaning to the left or right.

Consider your own recent consumption of media and information.  How much of
it was within categories or from sources you were already familiar and
comfortable with?  Did you listen to any country and western music recently?
Lawrence Welk?  Watch the 700 Club or Rush Limbaugh?  Probably not.

Its really fairly challenging to avoid consuming self affirming information
consistently.

Regards,

Peter Rothman

 From a guest blogger's link on boingboing.net ,

 People read books that reinforce their political beliefs much more
than books that challenge their beliefs (duh) :

 http://www.orgnet.com/leftright.html

 Given human nature, people's book buying habits are almost a given,
but it's interesting to see it reflected in actual research data.

 Have you challenged your beliefs recently ?

        THE RIGHT TO RAVE:     Glenn Reynolds

        Police and prosecutors in Racine County, Wisc. have backed down on=
=20
prosecutions against individuals arrested for, basically, attending a rave.=
=20
(=93Individuals who attend rave parties ... have certain constitutional=20

        You could have made the same kind of mass arrest at a Willie Nelson=

non-starter. Besides, the point was to shut down the rave scene in Racine.=

electronic music =97 see below =97 and I worked with the ACLU and the EMDEF=

another case, which the authorities also lost).

        This strategy of targeting raves has come about because the DEA and=
=20

blocking the spread of Ecstasy and other club drugs. The result has been a=
=20
series of highly publicized assaults on public events (since they=92re=20

=20
more to make the law enforcement agencies look like they=92re doing=
 something=20
than to actually accomplish anything. Call it appearance-oriented law=20
enforcement.

        The Racine authorities backed down on this one rather than risk=20
ruinous lawsuits for false arrest. That=92s a good thing, I guess, but I=20
almost wish that the lawsuits had gone ahead, since that would have=20

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Acid Test history (was: RE: [sfraves] Re: In defense of/ Disco?)

I went and pulled out my copy of "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" last 
night, and here's what it says about the Muir Beach Test:

"The third Acid Test was scheduled for Stinson Beach, 15 miles north of San 
Francisco...there was a nice solid brick recreation hall on the beach, all 
very nice--but at the last minute that deal fell through, and they shifted 
to Muir Beach, a few miles south...Muir Beach had a big log-cabin-style 
lodge for dances, banquets, and the like.  The lodge was stilted up out in a 
waste of frigid marsh grass.  A big empty nighttime beach in winter.  The 
lodge had three big rooms and was about 100 feet long, all logs and rafters 
and exposed beams, a tight ship of dark wood and Roughing It.  The Grateful 
Dead piled in with their equipment and the Pranksters with theirs..." (pp. 
213-14, paperback edition)

I also checked in other places, including the oral Prankster history "On The 
Bus" and McNally's recent history-of-the-Dead book, and nowhere can i find a 
reference to Muir Beach being a break-in.  and it's pretty unlikely, 
considering that Muir Beach is a small town, and a couple of hundred 
extremely stoned people dancing to a LOUD rock band--in 1965!--would have 
been very noticeable.  and they'd already gotten written up in the San Jose 
newspapers for their previous "drug orgy" (per the "On The Bus" book).

sorry to be so anal...i'm not in any way disputing the role of the Acid 
Tests as prototype-for-later-events.  it's just that if one is going to make 
historical analogies--especially ones to events in recent historical time 
and living memory--one should strive to be as accurate as possible, or risk 
discrediting the larger point by bobbling the details.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
...
10. Newsbrief:  Racine Caves Before the Ravers
    http://www.drcnet.org/wol/272.html#racinecaves

The city of Racine, WI, has dropped all charges against more than
400 people slapped with $968 tickets for "inhabiting a disorderly
house" at an electronic music benefit concert there in November
(http://www.drcnet.org/wol/266.html#raverebellion).  City
prosecutors admitted they couldn't prove their case and agreed to
dismiss all of the citations.  Persons who earlier pleaded guilty
or no contest to receive a reduced fine will also get their money
back.

The agreement, reached between the city and the American Civil
Liberties Union of Wisconsin, promises the city only that the ACLU
will now not sue.  The city also agreed to change its policies on
policing raves and to erase all records indicating that the
citations had ever been written.  The news came late Thursday
night, too late for DRCNet to seek comment.

Police had also arrested three people on drug charges at the
concert held to benefit a local community theater group, but also
outraged ravers and civil libertarians across the country by
ticketing the hundreds of other attendees.

Faced with a strong and largely unified resistance from those
ticketed, Racine prosecutors offered early on to drop the fines to
$100 in return for guilty pleas.  That didn't work.  Neither did
the offer to remove any mention of drugs from the charges.  Most
of the ticketed ravers pleaded not guilty and demanded trials, a
move that would cost the city untold dollars in legal expenses and
untold hours of police time as officers would be called to
testify.

Last week, the city blinked for a third time.  During a status
conference before the court, Racine prosecutors and attorneys
representing the electronic music fans agreed to cancel court
appearances set for the following today and enter into
negotiations to resolve the matter.  According to Racine attorney
Erik Guenther, who is volunteering with the American Civil
Liberties Union of Wisconsin, he and Racine officials were seeking
an "amicable resolution" of the matter.  Negotiations were
ongoing, Guenther told DRCNet, but he declined to provide details.
In the meantime, "individual pretrials set for January 10 have
been cancelled, as have all other appearances," Guenther said.
"We are now able to also instruct those people who have pled
guilty or no contest, but have not paid their fines, not to do so
for the time being."

Or ever, now that Racine has backed down.

No problem..  Unlike a lot of people I like to be corrected... I'm anal
about being wrong.. I didn't have my copy anywhere near me at the time
so I couldn't check myself.  Thanks :)   Since they didn't mention a who
and that most of the houses were empty in winter at that time (I'm
pretty sure they said Muir beach at that time pretty much shut down for
winter?) I just assumed it meant they broke into a lodge...  That said,
I still believe their idea of the Acid Tests being multimedia
extravaganza's and the 2 page description of the ideas behind it, it
just screamed of raves.  Espicially the one done with Bill Graham.

i totally agree...i've been saying that the Trips Festival was my ideal 
event model since before there were even raves :o)

seriously, i'd love to see more multi-media, more art installations, more 
fun things to play with at rave events.

Subject: [sfraves] Fuck DJ Dimitris?

I just received some more very obnoxious spam from him-

But thinking back- I don't think it's DJ Dimitris at all- I'm fairly
certain FGE Vlad is behind this.
Why?
Cause I remember getting a mail that was Dj Dimitris content or
something, but it came from Vlad...

Or it might have been the other way around- either way- I sure as hell
have never wisitied Dimitris' site, nor have I signed up for his
mailing list.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Fuck DJ Dimitris?

steps to rid yourself of this spam....

look at the headers to see what IP address (mailserver) the email came from,
then do a whois lookup on the IP address and contact the owner of the IP
address letting them know that they are sending unsolicited spam... i would
add in that you never OPTED-IN to this mailing list and have tried
"unsubscribing" multiple times, yet you keep receiving their spam...

I did this earlier today to hopefully rid myself of the spam i get from
reactionSF.com (which is hosted on an XO ip address) and i will be doing
this next time i get an email from either Dj Dimitris or Harry Denton or any
of those other wankers that like to send out spam in the bay area...

Yeah, I've been receiving much of the same. I was wondering if anyone else
was, but I wasn't sure if it was via SFR or if my email was shared with some
other promoters' lists. Same goes for a few other Bay Area DJ's whose lists
I've never joined.

To those of you who do choose to use this list as a spam mailing list, may I
present the following advice found on Craigslist:

  http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/7498550.html

And to those of you who would like to reduce your spam resulting from
signing up for things online, check out this excellent tool:

  http://www.spamgourmet.com

It's got a small learning curve, but once you get it going, it rocks!

I get a lot of the same spam as well, but I just assumed it was from
when I signed up with 1015 to win tickets for some even way back when.
But somehow I'm on nationwide party lists from Boston to Chicago to New
York... Oh well, it doesn't bother me too bad although my delete key is
almost dead.

[A BayRaves.com Sponsored Movement....]

The infamous "RAVE Act" has returned.  Disguised as 'amendments' to the 
current "Crack House" laws, these laws target and effect the entire 
music culture.   

Event promoters could be fined and IMPRISONED for up to 20 Years for 
drugs being inside their event.   Now ask yourself, when was the last 
time you've been to ANY music event that was completely drug-free?    
Probably never.  Which is why this law goes way beyond "raves". 

This will effect:
Raves
DJs
Nightclubs
Concerts
Festivals
Rally
Bars
Motels
Cruise Ships
....and MUCH MORE!!!

When the government attacks our freedom, we FIGHT BACK!!  

We realize "fighting back" takes time and effort.  But make the 
commitment, WE NEED EVERYONE TO COME TOGETHER.  If this law passes, 
you'll be at home Friday and Saturday night wishing you took action.

WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW:
Sign the Letter/Petition Tom Daschle (The sponsor of this bill) Online @ 
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=1448 - 
This only takes about 30 seconds.

Contact our California Senators...
Barbara Boxer - http://boxer.senate.gov/contact/webform.html
Dianne Feinstein - http://feinstein.senate.gov/email.html

If you're dedicated to protecting the scene, contact EVERY Senator in 
the Country!  You can find a complete list at
http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm

WHAT'S TO COME:
If our E-Mails, Faxes and Phone calls are not enough, we take to the 
streets in a Nationwide high-profile protest for our rights.  Stay 
tuned....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Fuck DJ Dimitris?

I've been getting his emails for so long I can't
remember when they even started...he can be hard to
avoid...counting all the spam, I think Dimitris must
be one of the hardest working Self-Promoting DJs in
the bay area...and the thing is, I heard him once and
hated it.  it's not like he's good (in my opinion),
which is maybe why he promotes so hard...

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  Thought for this Weekend

--=====================_17812488==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

"A time comes when silence is betrayal. Even when pressed by the demands of 
inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing their 
government's policy, especially in time of war. Nor does the human spirit 
move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought 
within one's own bosom and in the surrounding world....

"Some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have 
found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony, but we must 
speak. We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our 
limited vision, but we must speak. For we are deeply in need of a new way 
beyond the darkness that seems so close around us....

"We still have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent 
coannihilation. We must move past indecision to action. If we do not act, 
we shall surely be dragged down the long, dark, and shameful corridors of 
time reserved for those who possess power without compassion, might without 
morality, and strength without sight.

"Now let us begin. Now let us rededicate ourselves in the long and bitter, 
but beautiful struggle for a new world...."

Martin Luther King, Jr.,  April 4, 1967 in Riverside Church , New York City

Hope to see some of you at the Civic Center Rally tomorrow.

Love and Peace,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] Fuck DJ WHO????

Ok, this may be a lame question... BUUUT since we're on the subject...  =
WHO THE FUCK IS DJ Dimitris? =20

I'm really sick of this spam cuz i've got like 10 email addys that get =
spammed (in spite of unsubbing) and i have to deal with him spamming the =
hyperreal lists that i moderate.  But that doesn't bother me in the =
least.  What gets me is... who the heck is this guy?  I'm not trying to =
be rude, I've just never heard of him before, never seen him, never seen =
his name on a lineup and then bang out of nowhere this guy is just out =
there promoting himself as if he was Sven Vaeth or something.  I'm not =
knocking him per se, because I know less than nothing about him, but =
where the hell did he come from and when did he decided that the worlds =
most massive spam campaign would be a good thing?

Keep it Wet & Hard...

etc.)   we've talked to David Harness, Simon, etc who will spin at the
sunday party. we're looking to build a solid resident and new talent
crew of djs.
wow.

Subject: [sfraves] beans nrr

so, i will share a story....i know a man who has a
good heart, and sometimes a short fuse...one of my
friends always says, "men make mistakes...men make
mistakes." when my good hearted male friend "makes
mistakes", he goes away and hides his head under his
pillow, but, since he is also extremely curious, he
always leaves a little, tiny space so he can see
what's going on outside the pillowhead world...so
today, i was thinking that i will start calling him
beans sometimes...you know what i mean? like, "hi,
beans..i love you, beans." :)

Have you seen that Kotex ad campaign that claims that their feminine =
pads are "More secure than an email password?" WTF? This just blows me =
away. Now I don't expect everyone to be technically savvy, but I find it =
hard to believe that this campaign could make it on the air without =
someone raising a red flag. For those of you who are not big fat geeks =
like me, email (except for web based like hotmail) is accessed when your =
mail client, such as outlook express, sends your username and password =
IN CLEAR TEXT over the internet to your mail server. Anyone who wants to =
can sniff the traffic and grab your password. Plus, most people use =
passwords that are not too hard to guess if you do a little digging into =
the life and personality of your target. So, an email password is one of =
the LEAST secure things on the internet. I am astounded that Kotex would =
compare their product to it. I know, I know, I'm a huge nerd for being =
bothered by this, but what if it was Trojan that was making this =
comparison?  :-) 'nuff said.

Happy  :-)

but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes." -Hugh Downs

Actually, it raised the opposite red flag with me.  My passwords are 
non-words combinations of alpha-numeric characters.  You can't possibly 
guess them, and a dictionary cracker is useless.  Email passwords are far 
MORE secure than any maxi pad.  A max pad's bond can be broken (as per the 
commercial) using physical means: your hands.  Email passwords cannot be 
broken by physical means unless someone was stupid enough to write it down

Lol, ok, let me amend that. You are one of the very small minority of people
who don't use easy to crack passwords. The following is from an article
posted on Cnet: http://news.com.com/2009-1001-916719.html

"Fortune 100 corporations, small firms and even Internet service providers
with strong security have an Achilles heel: users who pick easily guessable
passwords. Some choose words straight out of Webster's dictionary, others
use a pet's name, and still more choose the name of a secret lover. Many who
think themselves tricky append a digit or two on the end of their chosen
word. Such feeble attempts at deception are no match for today's computers,
which are capable of trying millions of word variations per second and often
can guess a good number of passwords in less than a minute."

    Thus, I stand by my original statement, that email passwords are
inherently insecure.

just walk down any street in SoMA and look at ALL THE FUCKING TRASH FLYERS
LITTERING THE SIDEWALKS, STREETS, AND GUTTERS.

they're easy to spot. most are 8" x 10" or larger. in fact, i can see a few
from my front window!

or, hey, just call your local office of the DEA and ask them were da party
at. they'll be there for sure.

Now I don't expect everyone to be technically savvy, but I find it hard to believe that this campaign could make it on the air without someone raising a red flag. For those of you who are not big fat geeks like me, email (except for web based like hotmail) is accessed when your mail client, such as outlook express, sends your username and password IN CLEAR TEXT over the internet to your mail server. Anyone who wants to can sniff the traffic and grab your password. Plus, most people use passwords that are not too hard to guess if you do a little digging into the life and personality of your target. So, an email password is one of the LEAST secure things on the internet. I am astounded that Kotex would compare their product to it.

ok, still need help. please. 
still need venues.  still need djs.  /8P
we wanna still do a friday a.m. part every week. and a sunday monthly
day party. one of the hosts digs hip hop and deep house and one loves
just deep house. i do not, much.
our friday morning/day party rocks. we have some really good breaks
shit,  good funky house.  the locale is very cool, etc.   the hosts want
the sunday thing to be more house. i'm makng her do half n half.  trying
to get her to keep the friday gig as is,  too.
i'd like to be able to stay where we are, but don't know yet.  a locale
with a patio area would be great for the sunday party, since it'll be a
2p-12a party, and it's getting nice out.  

we really want to give newer djs a place to play, too, alongside
established better known local djs.

so...
SF locales?
djs?
which sunday would be open?

come on, guys, gimme some ideas.  /:)
smilies,
Shawn

we have djs established at Club 7 (leroy love jones, miss blu, dustin,
etc.)   we've talked to David Harness, Simon, etc who will spin at the
sunday party. we're looking to build a solid resident and new talent
crew of djs.

The anti-war march today in San Francisco had a huge crowd. I heard there 
were lines several blocks long at some of the Bart stations. ? 200,000 people 
jamming Market Street and absolutely packing the plaza at the Civic Center 
and adjacent streets. People had the greatest signs, very creative. I didn't 
have a sign but I jumped in and marched to the Civic Center. 
The resistance to the actions of "our" war-mongering regime is huge, and 
growing, C-Span has been showing extensive footage of today's march and rally 
in Washington DC. Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark presented a very 
strong case as to why President Bush should actually be impeached, on the 
basis of "high crimes and misdemeanors." Everyone in the National Mall just 
ROARED at the idea, chanting "Impeach Bush!" over and over. 
I'm about to leave to go to Love All Stars, and "love" in the name reminds me 
why this is an SRR instead of an NRR:   Peace Love Unity Respect     I think 
each letter, really, says "It's not right to invade another country to get 
control of their oil."  A lot of kids who go to parties are the age where 
they could get sent off to war. It really will hit close to home. 
To Peace and Love     :)

I heard the SF march was amazing here in Portland there were about 40,000 
marchers which is good for a city this size. It is so nice to see so many 
people agree on one thing. I am sure all of you have been discussing our new 
monarchy over the last months king Bush is going to be the death of what 
freedoms we have left. Peace

Subject: [sfraves] Sydney-ite looking for SF club/party

Hey there,
I'm going to be in SF on the weekend of the 24th Jan
and was hoping someone could point me in the right
direction for a electro, techno (Detroit style) or
deep house?

Anyone able to help out a tourist from Sydney ;)

Peace,

Yes, this afternoon was extraordinary.  I have been to many gatherings and 
marches to Civic Center and this was one of the largest I have ever 
seen.  Such diversity.  I walked for awhile with a WW II veteran who must 
have been near eighty.  Then there was the very elegant older woman with a 
cane, white hat and gloves, and long blue dress.  I thought she was 
beautiful.  The paraplegic in his mobile chair.  Punks.  Union 
folks.  Clergy.  Kids.  The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.  Stick 
Walkers.  Wondrous and colorful masks.  Painted faces.  All of us together 
with one common belief:  let's not have bloodshed in the Middle East.

The crowd was so big that it took us nearly three hours to go from the 
Embarcadero to Civic Center.  Caused much drama, I think, in SF Center with 
all the marchers crowding into that lower lever bathroom:)

I don't think the press can much longer ignore the ever growing opposition 
to this immoral preemptive oil war.  The numbers of dissenters grow with 
each march.  Perhaps we can prevent this Republic from becoming the Empire 
Bush and his associates desire.

Love and Peace,

Apollo

I actually didn't know about the march yesterday until I got into the city.  
I came into the city looking for apartments and I ended up trekking Markey 
avenue with an estimated 300,000 people.  It was quite the experience.  By 
far the largest protest that I have ever participated in.  The only thing 
that the protest really lacked was some good EDM.  All in all, I think that 
we have made our opinions known.  It is now time for the swine to respond.

Not if you run your imap or pop over ssl it doesn't.   If your ISP 
doesn't offer it, ask them to.  (Or run your own server).

They are really trying to.   Yesterday's march must have been twice as 
big as the one in October, yet it got less press coverage, there was 
less media there covering the march,  and they gave *lower* estimates 
for the number of people.   No way!!  You couldn't even sit down on 
City Hall plaza at the peak of it.  BART is usually pretty quiet on a 
Saturday morning, but it was jammed full of people of all ages and 
walks of life with protest signs.   They were was so overwhelmed with 
people coming on at Colma (not exactly a hotbed of radicalism!)  to get 
to the demonstration that they opened the fare gates and gave people a 
free ride.

I hear we got good coverage on CSPAN,  I wouldn't know, our cable 
system doesn't offer CSPAN (is that lame or what?)

We will never get any decent coverage in the mainstream press.
If we are 110% peaceful and well-behaved, they will downplay and 
underreport our protests.
Anything else and they will applaud as the government locks us up and 
shoots us as terrorists.

They will continue to try to marginalize us
to make us look like a few radical malcontents.

But those who came into the City yesterday (for whatever reason) knew 
otherwise.

Whey these people watched the coverage on evening news
They could see that they were not getting the whole story.

What I would like to see at the next rally and march, on February 18th, is 
a contingent of ravers for peace with a portable sound system.  I mean, 
there were Tango for Peace people dancing down the street, and I much 
admired them.  But I think as you that we should have the EDM community 
represent also.  What we would require is a small truck, generator, sound 
system, and some peeps to make some banners.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] pretty girls and sweaty pits nrr

do you think that girls look for sweaty pits? not
really asking, just posing a thought...today, i was
talking to a pretty girl, and i stretched my arms up
over my 
head to straighten my hairclips, and when i did, her
eyes went immmediately to my armpits, and after that,
i was thinking about what we were talking about and
feeling really intensely about what she might have
seen, 
because, sometimes, i am sweaty even though i do make
a point of using some good antiperspirant...even
though i try to 
do everything in my power to prevent getting wet under
the arms....so, when she finally left, i was not
dissappointed...i was relieved, because then i felt
comfortable taking a look 
under my arms, and, mercifully, it was all dry under
there, and even though i was wearing an old white
blouse, it was still white under the arms too...no
spots, no rings...i was very relieved...why was she
looking under my arms anyway? oh my gosh. oh, also,
yesterday, it was very crowded where i live...there
were hoards of people walking in the opposite
direction as me, and i was the only one eating a
banana. :)

My roommate moved out so there is a room now available in my house. : )

     The house is located in Marin in San Rafael in a safe, quiet set back=20
neighborhood but only minutes away from downtown (which hosts a major transi=

=A0=A0=A0=A0 The house has a large semi-landscaped backyard, fireplace, dish=

a dryer. The laundry mat is also across the street from a quaint market with=
=20
nearly everything you need, there is a racquet club just up the hill if you=20
like to swim or play tennis, plenty of parking in addition to the four space=

usually filled with fresh flowers and plants that I receive from work (an=20
added bonus at no extra charge ; ) ).
=A0=A0=A0=A0 You get the largest room with your own phone line already=20
installed/hooked up. There is also a cable line installed ready to be hooked=

it I just ask that you use your own pots/pans and clean thoroughly. You=20
should also know that I have a cat (short-haired). He is *very* sweet and=20
social and welcome to another kitty buddy if you have one. : D

And a bit about me- I'm an eighteen year old college student studying to be=20=

pyschoneuroimmunologist at the local college. I've been partying for four=20
years and I still go out regularly because I *love* to dance (why else would=

So the other night at the Nightvibe party at the Filmore David Harness spun 
this vocal house track that I fell in love with. The only parts of the vocals 
I can remember say something like "She's all of eighteen...sitting in a smoke 
filled cafe watching the world pass her by... she tells you she's all you've 
been ever searching for..." and the hook says, I think? "Welcome to the 
limelight!" I would love to know what the name of the track is. It totally 
look me over and I'm sure anyone looking at me giggled at the huge grin on my 
face. : )

heart,
Alida

hrm. I still believe that my voice, and actions, honestly make a 
difference. Otherwise, i would have given up very long ago.

Also, I *DO* believe the world's going to shit, and if I'm called to 
defend my way of life in this country, no matter how many of my 
liberties I've already lost, I'll do so, just to hold on to what little 
I have left.

World war III is coming, whether people like it or not. someone's gonna 
slip up, push the wrong button on a computer, and blow something up. I 
would much rather not have to fight, but if I have to, I will.

Subject: [sfraves] anti-war protest - good media resources & report

Hello from the Deep South!

Jim from SF here, visiting a friend in Hot Springs,
Arkansas.

I was at the anti-war protest and I think it was closer to
250-300,000 people, since it compared in size to Pride
celebrations.

Ignore the corporate-run media, use the independent media
such as

Independent Media Centers at

http://www.indymedia.org

IMC was founded around the Seattle 1999 anti-WTO protests
(where I was tear-gassed by out of control, storm-trooper
outfitted civilian cops)

and click on whichever city/region link you'd like: SF or
DC or whatever

Not in Our Name (global pledge of huge numbers against war)

http://www.notinourname.net

United for Peace

http://www.unitedforpeace.org

and all of the groups springing up much quicker than at a
comparable point in time during the Vietnam era, according
to activists from then.

At any rate, yeah, let's have Ravers for Peace in future
protests!

PLUR, always!

Jim

Also, no money, no war.  Get your money out of the banks and into the
credit unions ASAP.  Credit Unions can't fund war.

Agreed! If I felt that our way of life was in danger from outsiders, you bet
I'd pick up an automatic rifle, polish up my scope, and start picking off
invaders like they were animated ducks in a Nintendo game. I have no qualms
about that.

However, I hardly think that our impending war in the Middle East has
anything to do with defending our way of life, unless our way of life
includes the maintenance of artificially low petroleum prices.  Ermm...

That, on the other hand, is not my fight :)
unless I get drafted some time in the next month, I won't get involved.

As for impeaching bush, he hasn't done anything immoral and illegal in 
my opinion.

I'm actually going to be buying my first car some time in the next 
couple of weeks, and I can guarantee you it won't be an SUV. Actually, 
it'll probably be a small pickup truck, or a large car. Why? I actually 
need to haul shit. :) I would buy a hybrid truck if they existed, and 
were cheap as petrol-powered cars. but, alas, OPEC has the US by the 
balls, and I think the only thing bush is wanting to do, is cut those 
arms around his nutsack off. Anyhow, I'm gonna go watch television now.

Subject: [sfraves] ESC live set from new years eve 


I just uploaded my set from new years eve at the otherworld warehouse.

It was a combination of elements from my tracks, and other people's
tracks, so I call it hybrid live...  Since this was the first (since the
old industrial days) live performance I've done, there is a new section
"live performances".  Go figure...

The set is all techno.

Everything was totally flawless, until matter pulled out the power cable
from the computer...  ugg...  But I cleaned up the empty space in the
recording, so this file is seamless.

Enjoy, and please let me know what you think.

The file is here (with all my other archives):

HAHAHAHAHA!!  The BRAT!  I always used to lust after those for some
unknown reason back in high school.

As far as Bush doing "anything immoral or illegal"..  Well, he may not
have violated any particular laws, but launching a manhunt for a
specific group and its leader, and then halfway through that, kind of
just going, "Uhh, I'm tired of that, my dad said Iraq was kind of fun..
 Maybe I'll go after that!", and redirecting the entire effort towards
a very random and largely uncalled-for war, is not a moral action.

Does anyone else remember the media transformation, almost in a single
day, from "Let's get Bin Laden and the Al-Quieda!", to "Let's blow up
Iraq again!"?  Did anyone else do a double-take and say, "wait, how'd
we get back to Saddam again?"?

I mean, the man bald-facedly took the presidency after a race that was
very clearly bungled, and perhaps even deliberately.  He lost the
frickin' vote, but the powers that be said, "Uh, Bush gets it", and he
took it with a smile.

I shouldn't be at work- it's MLK day.

Hi everyone-
I would just like to say how proud I am of all of you who went to the march 
on Saturday. At Love Allstars, countless people from the list came up to me 
and told me they went because of my post. The march was awesome. I saw on the 
news that morning that "an estimated 10,000 people will be there"...ha ha ha 
try 200,000 people. All day long I ran around and told older activists about 
PLUR and what it represents. One person told me if we all lived by those 4 
basic principles, we wouldnt be at that march, we wouldnt need to be. 
Saturday was my frist massive demonstration and I will never forget it. Thank 
you to all who came and remember, with enough people, we can make a difference
Britty

I'm going to contact the parade organizers tomorrow to see what exactly 
their permits allow.  We may have to be creative about this for a number of 
reasons.  A truck would have to have several monitors surrounding it to 
assure safety (I've done this before for other march/events), and one must 
remember that many in the march are very eco minded and might not be happy 
with a motorized vehicle.  I know I can get hold of a flatbed, but I think 
that would be overkill.

I'll be setting up the list tomorrow also, so I'll keep all of you posted.

Love,

Apollo

how about a horse-pulled platform with solar power?

or... a few marine/car batteries run through an inverter for the sound.
we could pull the whole thing with 2 bikes.

If the "They Go in Threes" myth is true, then who will 
complete the trio with Richard Crenna and Al Hirschfeld?

Is Bob Hope still alive?

Subject: [sfraves] Anybody want a '70 VW Bug?

'Sup all!

For those of you that know me, I'm sure you'll be familiar with my old ride, a
1970 VW Bug.  However, no charities will take it (it's older than 1976), so I'm
going to sell it and donate the profits to the San Francisco SPCA.

Please forward this E-mail to anybody that you think would be interested.  I'm
willing to negotiate on the price, I just want to get as much to the SPCA as I
can.

Peace!

Here's the URL for my craigslist ad:
http://www.craigslist.org/cgi-bin/smp

Here's the text of the ad:

1600cc stock motor, in good shape. Runs great, compression is consistent and
good on all 4 cylinders. Lots of new parts. Here's what's been done in the last
6 months: New clutch & cable, new carburetor, new chrome 360 air cleaner, new
fuel/oil hoses, 5 new tires (yes, the spare too!), new plugs/wires/cap/rotor,
and new oil cooler seals. Title and registration are clean. 

The bad: Needs some body work and paint. "Standard" hole in passenger rear
floorpan due to battery acid. Needs upholstery work. Probably will also need a
brake fluid flush & refill and new front shoes. 

Pics to come soon.

p,


c. got it right off the bat.

but, since you asked....

'Pattern Recognition'

http://tinyurl.com/4ogh

is the spankin' brand new novel by William Gibson, starring another 'Case',
tho' her name is
spelled 'Cayce' and she deals with corporate logos and their origin, hence
the title.

'Pattern Recognition...'

is also used by our Armed Forces intelligence and one of the tests they use
to see if candidates
have any aptitude for that sort of thing is to see if they can quickly spot
the word 'NINA,' (the title of this post), in drawings by the caricturist,
Al Hirschfeld.

In his line drawings since 1945 Hirschfeld buried the word NINA as a tribute
to his daughter, Nina.

http://tinyurl.com/4ofp

Hirschfeld died today, hence the 'another one bites the dust' ref.

and yes,  Bob Hope is still with us, good catch.

anyone making book on him making it to his cenntarial b-day on 5/29/03?

btw, the last time we were hit with the 'myth of they go in threes' was
around Father's Day 2001
when, along with my Dad, Jack Lemmon, John Lee Hooker and Caroll O'Connor
all went in the same week.

Bob would round this week's death toll out nicely.

Well...anyone have a horse?:)  Actually, there was an antique hearse pulled 
by two horses in the march on Sunday.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RE: Acid Test history (was: RE: [sfraves] Re: In defense of/ Disco?)


My last trip down 84 was with my ex-roommate who wanted to buy a hat at the
General Store @ San Gregorio and asked me to go with.

His mom knows the couple that the La Honda Prankster House was sold to, and
once introduced them to me as they were having coffee at La Dolce Vita in
Palo Alto as I was passing through on my way to work.

Of course they didn't tell me at the time, that they were living there.

This time I got smart and insisted, while passing through La Honda, that
since he has been on the property for a party that he and his mom got
invited to, that he show me the house, which he did, but refused to stop the
car since he was eager to get that damn hat.

Whatever.

There is a *lot* of psychedelic history in the Bay Area that got
steamrollered over by the dot.com gold rush, ist eine schade, but i've
already posted on that at length and i won't bore u any further with it

I was reading Hunter S. Thompson's Song's of the Doomed today where he
describes dropping acid for the first time at that house, the occasion being
the first meet btwn the hell's angel's and the Pranksters that he helped
arrange.

He described it as being a hotbed for police activity that night, which must
have been something since the road today is a two laner.

Anyways, I don't how anyone, even with the most slightest of readings, could
not see the Prankster's 'Tests' as being a precursor of today's parties, but
maybe that's just me.

i totally agree...i've been saying that the Trips Festival was my ideal

seriously, i'd love to see more multi-media, more art installations, more

Just a little FYI if you have Wells Fargo as a bank.

Have you ever heard of a Returned Statement Fee?  Well, I never have and
it showed up on my statement.  Its amazing how many little things can pop
up on statements that you may miss, but I saw this one and I was like what
the hell does that mean?

So, I sent an email to them.

This is what they said:

The $5.00 fee was charged to your account because your monthly statement
was returned by the Post Office as undeliverable.  It was mailed to the
address we currently have on file.

Umm excuse me! Take it up with the POST OFFICE I have lived at my current
address for over 8 months if not longer and I have received statements from
them regularly.  So, who sets the policies for their banks and their fees?
I think it is terrible customer service to charge a fee for something like
that.  It is my problem if I do not receive my statements, it certainly does
not put them out in anyway.

So, The Moral of the story, ALWAYS check your bank statements (Credit Cards)
too, and if you do end up moving make sure you let your bank know first so
they dont start charging you fees for all I know they may charge it every
time a statement goes out?

Has anyone else heard of a bank doing this? $5.00 seems like a little bit of
money but if they hit people all over the place regularly, it could
certainly add up for them.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Beware of Wells Fargo's sneaky Fee's

Wells Fargo is evil.  I was with Wells for 6 years and was on direct deposit
and this happened to me:

Quit my job after 5+ years...had 3 checks ready to clear after my deposit,
checks were about $20, $42,
and $70, had about $65.00 in the bank.  My work decided to cancel my direct
deposit for the final pay
period w/out telling me and so then.....Wells ran the $70 check first, it
bounced of course causing a $25.00
NSF fee....then they ran the $42.00 check (now i have $40.00 in the bank) it
bounced, $25 more NSF,
then they ran the $20 check (now I have $15.00 in the bank) it bounced, $25
more NSF.  Now I'm negative
$10.00, but wait it gets better!

They also charged me $25 (or so) "returned item fee" for each check.
Then....they ran each check TWO more
times ($25 NSF x 3 x 2) and charged me a $25 return item fee per check per
run ($25 x 3 x 2).  All this
happened in 3 days!  So upon calling to check on my account expecting a
buncha money (my pay minus those
three checks) I found out I had sometime along the lines of -$390.00.  While
grappling with my work to
get my my pay (via check, as i found out at this point) my "bank charge" of
$7.00 per month is due....I got whacked
for an NSF for that....then they tried to run it again....and again, whack,
whack.  Within 7 days of when I should have
gotten my pay via direct deposit I was in the hole about $475.00 or so.  The
funny part is that I actually had
enough money in the bank to pay the 20 and 42 checks, but of course they
didn't run them that way even though
they all (the first time) ran through the same night :)  Evil Evil Evil!

Just a little FYI if you have Wells Fargo as a bank.

Have you ever heard of a "Returned Statement Fee"?  Well, I never have and
it showed up on my statement.  It's amazing how many little things can pop
up on statements that you may miss, but I saw this one and I was like what
the hell does that mean?

So, I sent an email to them.

This is what they said:

"The $5.00 fee was charged to your account because your monthly statement
was returned by the Post Office as undeliverable.  It was mailed to the
address we currently have on file."

Umm excuse me! Take it up with the POST OFFICE I have lived at my current
address for over 8 months if not longer and I have received statements from
them regularly.  So, who sets the policies for their banks and their fee's?
I think it is terrible customer service to charge a fee for something like
that.  It is my problem if I do not receive my statements, it certainly does
not put them out in anyway.

So, The Moral of the story, ALWAYS check your bank statements (Credit Cards)
too, and if you do end up moving make sure you let your bank know first so
they don't start charging you fees for all I know they may charge it every
time a statement goes out?

Has anyone else heard of a bank doing this? $5.00 seems like a little bit of
money but if they hit people all over the place regularly, it could
certainly add up for them.

Jeanavive,
Don't let the man hold us down.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: Beware of Wells Fargo's sneaky Fee's

My wells fargo story:

Terri has electronic Bill Pay through Golden One.
She accidentally  chose "Wells Fargo" as her Payee instead of "Working
Assetts", so a check for $50 went to Wells Fargo.  A laser check was cut
& sent to WF by mistake and it was cashed - even tho she has had no open
account with them since 1995.  And worse, they are now saying that they
have no record of the check - even tho Golden One sent us an copy of it
(which has the Wells Fargo endorsement stamp and a "routing" number on
the back of the check.  They have so far refused to refund her her money
- even tho we have proven to them it was their fault and they have
agreed... But so far have given nothing but a runaround on how to get
our $$ back.

4 months and this is still an ongoing battle...

I HATE WF!!!

Subject: [sfraves] lipstick and bondage nrr

okay, lipstick: so, i had a little cash, and i've been
going kook-a-monga on the cosmetics lately, and in the
interim (sp?), i have been learning a few things about
lipsticks...for the extra girlie girl or boy, of
course...goes without saying, but then again, i do
know that i am sort 
of writing to an audience of sorts, and i know what
that means....anyway, i was having a chat with a group
of ladies who were in a good mood, and we were all
enjoying 
speaking freely about lace and cosmetics as many girls
do, and one of them recommended this book that is
called something like, "Don't Go To The Cosmetics
Counter Without Me", 
and basically what that book and our conversation
is/was about is that you should be careful not to get
too 
wound up in how much your products cost, but buy for
quality...okay? okay...so, back to lipsticks
again...i've been buying a few lipsticks...there are
some new kinds...you can get lipstick with a sunscreen
in 
it now...there are also a lot of sheer color lipsticks
available (i've been wearing a few different sheers
made by loreal...they are all very pretty and they
smell sweet)....some of them are shiney...like a lip
gloss, but are rich in color like a lipstick...oh, and
then there are still the ones that are creme, frost or
have a matte finish to them...one girl recommended
that i try one 
of those kinds of lipsticks that you paint the color
on first, then let it dry, and then you paint a
moisterizer over the top of it, and then when you kiss
or drink tea, it doesn't come off....i think that i
might not like those, so i haven't bought any
yet...maybe later...i imagine that they might be
drying, and i don't mind reapplying...that is part of
the fun....reapplying...especially in public
places...i have some lipsticks that aren't supposed to
be long wearing like 
that, but they do just basically stain your lips and
not come off anyway for whatever reason, and i don't
like that...i mean, once, i put vaseline on my lips
something like three times in a row and wiped firmly
across 
my mouth, and there was still i pink stain there, and
it was kind of disturbing..maybe i might like
something like that at another time, which is why i
didn't throw the two 
lipstick  that i have like that that aren't supposed
to be long wearing but are away...oh, this is getting
kind of  long...i can't believe your still reading,
especially if your not interested...why do you do
that...just delete..i do...okay, so bondage...i used
to have a 
really good book on bondage and i can't remember the
name of it, but it had a black cover and it was
hardcovered, and well, you can make your own decisions
and all 
about lipsticks and bondage and such, but there are
some things that you should make yourself aware of, if
you are not already aware...like things like flogging
can potentially kill a person or tying them up the
wrong way could seriously injure them...there's a
whole science 
behind the bondage s/m scene...so, if i can remember
the name of the book, i'll try to remember to post it,
but basically do your homework and read up on stuff,
and don't let someone you don't trust put their hands
on you...i haven't come across too many people in my
life who are totally hardcore, but i have had some 
things come up where basically, i had to help
people...i had to do things like find a good and
trustworthy 
professional take care of my mates for me...so,
anyway, i guess you could learn a few things from the
folsom street fair or something...i've just been
thinking about 
this a lot lately, because i see a lot of people
becoming more interested in the scene, but also, maybe
they shouldn't 
be becoming directly involved in any serious s/m role
playing games until they know what they are
doing...you have to be completly honest with
yourself...i mean, firstly, you have to be emotionally
mature...there's purpose and intent in
everything...good intentions are meaningless when
anyone gets hurt..also, just because you are enjoying
your fantasy, doesn't mean that anyone else
is.....like, for example, when i go out dancing or to
a small party, i don't like the smell of some
strangers or 
even friends having sex...body odor is just that, and
also, i don't get off on anyone else's
business....things happen though, i know, i see, and i
am just tolerant up to a point....okay, over and out,
even though this was probably gett'in darned good for
you. :)

Depends - I don't know if the clause would be valid against a check
cashed against a close account.

We'll see tho.

Subject: [sfraves] Check out this Website to make complaints RE: [sfraves] NRR: Beware of Wells Fargo's sneaky Fee's

Hey, I ready every ones Wells Fargo stories and that sucks.  I know I am
only fighting a $5.00 fee error on their part but that is certainly the
stepping-stone to bigger things as you have proved.

I found this great site for consumers: It rates companies as well and you
can read other letters that are addressed to the correct individuals in each
company. It is free as well.

"The http://www.planetfeedback.com Web site gives consumers power through
communication. You can craft and send the perfect letter to any company.
Copy the letter to others! Resend it! Track it! PlanetFeedback.com helps you

Just a little FYI if you have Wells Fargo as a bank.

Have you ever heard of a "Returned Statement Fee"?  Well, I never have and
it showed up on my statement.  It's amazing how many little things can pop
up on statements that you may miss, but I saw this one and I was like what
the hell does that mean?

So, I sent an email to them.

This is what they said:

"The $5.00 fee was charged to your account because your monthly statement
was returned by the Post Office as undeliverable.  It was mailed to the
address we currently have on file."

Umm excuse me! Take it up with the POST OFFICE I have lived at my current
address for over 8 months if not longer and I have received statements from
them regularly.  So, who sets the policies for their banks and their fee's?
I think it is terrible customer service to charge a fee for something like
that.  It is my problem if I do not receive my statements, it certainly does
not put them out in anyway.

So, The Moral of the story, ALWAYS check your bank statements (Credit Cards)
too, and if you do end up moving make sure you let your bank know first so
they don't start charging you fees for all I know they may charge it every
time a statement goes out?

Has anyone else heard of a bank doing this? $5.00 seems like a little bit of
money but if they hit people all over the place regularly, it could
certainly add up for them.

Jeanavive,
Don't let the man hold us down.

Subject: [sfraves] RE: lipstick and bondage nrr

Did you know lipsticks and cosmetics are pretty much manufactured in about
three major companies across the countries and then they are shipped out to
L'Oreal, Prescriptives what ever, who repackage and mark them up insanely.
There is not much difference in products unless you are looking into skin
care.

My make-up instructor said "it is all about the application not the product
she could use mud and make it work."

As well as a make-up artist, I have direct access to some of these
manufacturers and lipsticks and shadows for about $2's plus depending on
which dazzling solution you are into.  Perhaps if you are all dying to break
away from the system perhaps I can arrange to share the scoop.
And well the Bondage I have tips for that to but I will get into that when I
know you better, but to start every women should own a leather corset, not
the PVC crap either. Nothing beats the feeling of leather on your skin.

Subject: lipstick and bondage nrr

okay, lipstick: so, i had a little cash, and i've been
going kook-a-monga on the cosmetics lately, and in the
interim (sp?), i have been learning a few things about
lipsticks...for the extra girlie girl or boy, of
course...goes without saying, but then again, i do
know that i am sort
of writing to an audience of sorts, and i know what
that means....anyway, i was having a chat with a group
of ladies who were in a good mood, and we were all
enjoying
speaking freely about lace and cosmetics as many girls
do, and one of them recommended this book that is
called something like, "Don't Go To The Cosmetics
Counter Without Me",
and basically what that book and our conversation
is/was about is that you should be careful not to get
too
wound up in how much your products cost, but buy for
quality...okay? okay...so, back to lipsticks
again...i've been buying a few lipsticks...there are
some new kinds...you can get lipstick with a sunscreen
in
it now...there are also a lot of sheer color lipsticks
available (i've been wearing a few different sheers
made by loreal...they are all very pretty and they
smell sweet)....some of them are shiney...like a lip
gloss, but are rich in color like a lipstick...oh, and
then there are still the ones that are creme, frost or
have a matte finish to them...one girl recommended
that i try one
of those kinds of lipsticks that you paint the color
on first, then let it dry, and then you paint a
moisterizer over the top of it, and then when you kiss
or drink tea, it doesn't come off....i think that i
might not like those, so i haven't bought any
yet...maybe later...i imagine that they might be
drying, and i don't mind reapplying...that is part of
the fun....reapplying...especially in public
places...i have some lipsticks that aren't supposed to
be long wearing like
that, but they do just basically stain your lips and
not come off anyway for whatever reason, and i don't
like that...i mean, once, i put vaseline on my lips
something like three times in a row and wiped firmly
across
my mouth, and there was still i pink stain there, and
it was kind of disturbing..maybe i might like
something like that at another time, which is why i
didn't throw the two
lipstick  that i have like that that aren't supposed
to be long wearing but are away...oh, this is getting
kind of  long...i can't believe your still reading,
especially if your not interested...why do you do
that...just delete..i do...okay, so bondage...i used
to have a
really good book on bondage and i can't remember the
name of it, but it had a black cover and it was
hardcovered, and well, you can make your own decisions
and all
about lipsticks and bondage and such, but there are
some things that you should make yourself aware of, if
you are not already aware...like things like flogging
can potentially kill a person or tying them up the
wrong way could seriously injure them...there's a
whole science
behind the bondage s/m scene...so, if i can remember
the name of the book, i'll try to remember to post it,
but basically do your homework and read up on stuff,
and don't let someone you don't trust put their hands
on you...i haven't come across too many people in my
life who are totally hardcore, but i have had some
things come up where basically, i had to help
people...i had to do things like find a good and
trustworthy
professional take care of my mates for me...so,
anyway, i guess you could learn a few things from the
folsom street fair or something...i've just been
thinking about
this a lot lately, because i see a lot of people
becoming more interested in the scene, but also, maybe
they shouldn't
be becoming directly involved in any serious s/m role
playing games until they know what they are
doing...you have to be completly honest with
yourself...i mean, firstly, you have to be emotionally
mature...there's purpose and intent in
everything...good intentions are meaningless when
anyone gets hurt..also, just because you are enjoying
your fantasy, doesn't mean that anyone else
is.....like, for example, when i go out dancing or to
a small party, i don't like the smell of some
strangers or
even friends having sex...body odor is just that, and
also, i don't get off on anyone else's
business....things happen though, i know, i see, and i
am just tolerant up to a point....okay, over and out,
even though this was probably gett'in darned good for
you. :)

Please don't ever go on judge judy Dina.  I would die laughing, and I'm 
too young to die as I don't even have kids yet (although it turns out 
the bitch is probably pregnant which is just friggin great...)  but 
anyways.... as far as well fartgo goes, they are the most evil company 
on the planet.  BUUUUUT, I've been with them now for 10 years, after all 
the rediculous fees because when i've been in europe at 9am there (which 
is midnight here) and had drama with my ATM card, there was always a 
live person on the other end of the wellsfargo phone to fix my shit.  So 
while 90% of the time I have problems with my account its their fault 
and they are ripping me off blind, I just consider the fees payment for 
having a live person on the phone to fix my crap when im sitting in a 
berlin train station starving my ass off.  They are evil, shady and the 
most greedy fucks on the planet, but their ATM cards work on every 
european atm i've ever used, and when they didn't a simple phone call 
was all it took to fix it.  So while they are probably not the best bank 
in the world by any means, I think they are still with the pain if you 
travel a lot.

Keep it Wet & Hard...

I have some solar panels and charge controllers.

I've got a couple, how long we'd run for depends on how power-hungry 
the system is
and how much sun we get.   We'd want to start with a full charge, of 
course.

We could just push the float.  The march was moving so slowly at times 
it was difficult for the cyclists to ride slowly enough.

This may interest some of you. I find it amusing in a really awful way.

In short, the above summarize Grampa Bush's involvement in selling weapons
to the nazis during WW2, in order to keep his business interests afloat.

hope ya'll don't take this the wrong way but i just couldn't keep the image
of the Polish Cavalry out of my head.

those were about some of history's Bravest, but fuck, they got steamrollered
anyways, didn't they?

this is all like a really bad movie and i'm just hoping solar doesn't become
economically viable cuz those oil fields get contaminated in retaliation...

hey,  :)
i need to set up a website, although my computer access/knowledge is
limited.  i need to be able to store and send photos, email, etc.
i would be using it for promoting locally, photography, and related
purposes.
any ideas?  ideally someone else would set it up, or it would be easy
for me to do, free or very cheap.
any ideas or sites would help.  i am also looking to sell my photos.
again, all leads are greatly appreciated!! 
thanks!!

2. Any recommendations for a tattoo parlor between Berkeley and =

Two questions to the vast SFR knowledge base:

1. Does anyone know of good, gay 18+ clubs in the bay?

2. Any recommendations for a tattoo parlor between Berkeley and Vacaville?

Thanks.

Solar is becoming viable because of the robber barons who own PG&E,
and their friends at Enron, and their friends in the White House.
Here in California, our electricity rate tops out at 26 cents/kwh!

Subject: [sfraves] More Wells Fargo BS!  [NRR]

Hey, let's add fuel to the anti-Wells fire!

Oooh, looks like all of a sudden, Wells Fargo online banking is blocking
alternate browsers (e.g. non-IE or Netscape).

  http://www.powerpage.org/story.lasso?newsID=10465

Corporate whores! :)

I left them years ago, tired of being charged for going inside to actually
interact with a teller. Seriously. This is the banking equivalent of being
charged $8 for a bottle of water at a party.

At my old branch, they would give each teller a sticker to put on deposit
envelopes with their employee number on it - that way, for every live
customer they referred to an ATM (after waiting in line for half an hour),
they would receive a bonus. Can you believe that? They were paying employees
extra to not serve people.

I switched to Glendale Federal, which was great until they merged with Cal
Fed and got into the nickel-and-diming bullshit. I ended up paying at least
$35 in fees a month on my checking and savings accounts.

Last year I changed over to Washington Mutual and couldn't be happier. The
only fees I pay are if I use oddball ATMs or - god forbid - bounce a check,
and even then it's only $10. For the record, my ATM card *did* work in
Europe perfectly, and at a very good exchange rate at that. So they have my
wholehearted endorsement. So you don't necessarily need a big, bullyish bank
like Wells or BofA to use your card internationally.

Your best bet, IMO, is to keep a safe amount in your checking account for
your regular bills, etc.... and then go Mafioso and keep everything else in
mattresses ;)

It's worthwhile to take this poll just to see the results. The disparity
between the online results and the Newsweek poll responses on the same
question is rather fascinating.

The online voting seems to skew a lot more toward the way I voted, meaning
that internet-savvy people are obviously far more enlightened and know
what's right than those magazine-reading yes-men ;) Hah.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] More Wells Fargo BS!  [NRR]

I have used BOA, Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo. I can say that I like
Wells Fargo the best. I never need to go inside ( DUH THAT WHAT ATM'S ARE
FOR) So the only time I get charged two bucks in when I call, witch is like
once a month. BOA is a bunch of thieves, and their online banking system is
horrible. Washington Mutual would take up to a month to clear checks and
rarely made all of my deposit available within 4 days. I love Wells Fargo's
online banking system, it's up to the minute and it helps me manage me
account. From what I understood there are several types of accounts you can
get with Wells Fargo and if you pick the right one for you chances are you
wont be paying any more than your normal account fees each month.

What's your point? That 67% of this nation has its head ups its ass? I think 
that was made clear on Market Street last Saturday.

...Although, I do admit interesting.

We'll see how many people can "drive" to protest 'ol George when we have no 
oil.

Wait, you mean this war IS about oil!? Shit, I thought it was about
liberating the oppressed Shiite class of Iraq from the hands of an evil
dictator and stopping the threat of being fired upon by empty chemical
warheads.

Subject: [sfraves] Security at parties...

A friend of mine pointed me, earlier today, to a thread over on bayraves asking
what everyong thinks about security at parties thesedays.  I sat down to make a
quick reply.  And, as is my habit, wound up with more of a short article, about
five times longer than the post I intended.

As I sat back and re-read it, I think I made some good points.  And, honestly,
I care more about SFRaves' opinion than I do about bayraves'.

So I'm curious as to wether or not you my points, especially the six I
enumerated and the ones about simple respect and how parties used to avoid
getting busted, have any validity.  It really does seem to me like fixing those
six points alone would fix up a LOT of the ill will that sometimes spawns
between ravers (yes, even (perhaps especially) me) and security.  (But
promoters actually respecting the people who attend their parties would go even
further.)

Or am I wrong?

I, for a change, suceeded in staying pretty levelheaded and non-flameish
throughout writing it.  So I'll just repost the whole thing below here:


I think the level of security shows a fundamental hipocracy in some promoters. 
Sure, you need a couple of guys around in order to eject someone unruly, but...

Perhaps it's a bit cheezy to mention it, but what doed the "R" in PLUR stand
for?  RESPECT.

Promoters tell us all the time on flyers, on infolines, on messageboards, and
the like, to "respect the venue" or "respect the party" or "respect the scene"
or "respect the underground".  But then, from before we even get in the door,
promoters have their hirelings treating the attendees with complete DISrespect,
as though we were criminals before the fact.  This sort of "do as I say, not as
I do" hipocracy has annoyed the living crap out of me for as long as I can
remember.

And I don't buy the "we HAVE to do it to keep the party from being busted"
line.  While that mat be true at some *venues*, I could list plenty of parties
that, if they had security at all, had completely invisible and non-intrusive
security, and did NOT get busted.

It seems like there was a shift somewhere...  Parties used to avoid getting
busted by not overuseing venues, by being discrete, by employing map and
shuttle points.  Somewhere along the line, the way parties avoided getting
busted changed to "have them all in Campbell and have increasingly draconian
security".  It's not a change I like at all.  And even THEN, I've heard of some
Campbell parties shutting down early.

All that said though, I do have to agree that if security *IS* going to be
strict, Arnie and crew are the way to go.  At least they generally behave
professionally and courteously about it.  I ESPECIALLY like the way that, if
the line's not too busy, they'll let you go back and drop off whatever they're
not allowing in in your car, and come right back to the front of the line.  And
Arnie himself will often be near the end of the line to fill you in in advance.
 (Tho even Arnie is pretty random about what he will allow into the party
sometimes.  Once (at Circuit Breaker) he even made me go put my Photon Lights
back in the car.)

I can't think of any security crew other than Arnie's that I've actually ever
actually liked.  I've been indifferent toward a few others.  But, by and large,
outside of Arnie's crew they're just a bunch of thugs.

Tho I think that a lot of the ill will that some people have for security would
go away if they (including even Arnie) were to acknowledge some basic common
sence:

 1)  People HATE to wait in line.  It's just human nature, especially if they
can hear the music just on the other side of the wall or if they drove alone
and are meeting their friends inside.  If people have to wait more than ten,
fifteen minutes tops, after parking to get into the party then you're going too
slow.  If you have to be less strict to speed things up, suck it up and bring
more people next time.  The half-hour to an hour waits at SOME parties in
recent memory are just flat out inexcusable.
 
 2)  Nothing short of a strip-search is going to stop every twerp with one or
two pills for his own use from getting them in.  A decent patdown WILL find the
thugs with the guns, and it WILL find the bag of 200 pills taped to the thigh
of a dealer.  The whole "empty your pockets onto the table" routine is just
flat-out insulting.
 
 3)  If something doesn't need to be in the party, it doesn't need to be in the
party.  And it shouldn't make a damn bit of difference if it's stuffed into a
pocket or in a BACKPACK!  This is doubly annoying, as it's a long established
tradition that some ravers make parties into something of a costume affair,
with cutsey backpacks completing the outfit.
 
 4)  While we're at it... it seems that certian securtity types missed the ACLU
slapping down the cops and establishing, in federal court, that the various
raver toys (glowsticks, bottled water, binkies, Photons, candy beads, etc) are
*NOT*, in fact, drug paraphanelia.
 
 5)  Believe it or not, some ravers don't bring pens and paper/books into
parties to make drug connections.  Some of us (*GASP*) make new *friends* at
parties, and would like to exchange contact information so we can keep in
touch.
 
 and finally... (this one is rapidly becoming my pet peeve...)
 
 6)  If someone's decided to do drugs at that party, they're going to do them. 
Taking away or disallowing gum and candy (edible this time... like blow-pops,
jolly ranchers, breath mints, and the like) won't stop them.  It just annoys
those of us who plan to be sober that night, but would like to taste something
other than the inside of our own mouth for the next eight hours!!!
 
 
 cya,
 john

--=====================_14885403==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"; format=flowed

A new opposition front in the drug war.


Criminalizing peaceful people who use psychoactive drugs to deepen their
spiritual life is criminal itself, some groups are arguing.


Salim Muwakkil. Salim Muwakkil is a senior editor at In These Times.


January 20, 2003


A new front has opened in opposition to the war on drugs--a religious
front.


Several newly formed groups are contesting our prohibitionist, anti-drug
strategies because they restrict religious freedom and "cognitive
liberty."


Drugs alter consciousness and "the right to control one's own
consciousness is the quintessence of freedom," reads part of a manifesto
of the Journal of Cognitive Liberties. The journal is one of many projects
of the four-year-old Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics, a
California-based, non-profit group that promotes intellectual freedom. The
group defines cognitive liberty as "the right of each individual to think
independently and autonomously, to use the full spectrum of his or her
mind and to engage in multiple modes of thoughts and alternative states of
consciousness."


The group is involved in several projects designed to raise issues of
cognitive liberty in relation to the war on drugs. In the journal's Summer
2000 edition, center co-director Richard Glen Boire wrote "the so-called
`war on drugs' is not a war on pills, powder, plants and potions, it is
war on mental states--a war on consciousness itself-- how much, what sort
we are permitted to experience, and who gets to control it." Boire argued
that much of the motivation for the war on drugs is an attack on
"entheogenic" drugs (roughly, God evoking) that provoke "transcendent and
beatific states of communication with the deity."


With this point, Boire lends his argument to a growing movement of
Americans devoted to the use of entheogens. One branch of this movement
calls itself "neo-shamanistic" and seeks out shamanic inebriants that have
been used for centuries. They cite examples like peyote cactus and
psilocybin mushrooms among Native Americans, ibogaine among indigenous
Africans, soma in India and ayahuasca in the Amazonian rain forest.


Others are just spiritual seekers who argue that criminal sanctions on the
use of these psychoactive sacraments restrict their religious freedom.
Some make the argument that the state takes its cue from organized
religions, which historically have demonized entheogens because they
lessen the need for a clergy to connect God to humanity.


Many of the substances they champion (psilocybin, peyote/mescaline, LSD,
marijuana, etc.) are the same drugs that were called psychedelic during
the 1960s. These substances are now called entheogenic to distance them
from the hedonistic excesses of the '60s drug culture.


Along with some newly discovered substances (salvia divinorium, phalaris
grass, ibogaine, ayahuasca/yage, etc), some of which are still
precariously legal, this fledgling movement is taking the spiritual high
road in its opposition to the drug war.


Another one of the groups leading the charge is the Council on Spiritual
Practices. Founded by Robert Jesse, 43, a former vice president of Oracle,
the group focuses on evoking "primary religious experiences," which they
believe can be evoked by many practices, including fasting, meditation,
prayer, yoga and ingesting entheogenic drugs.


The group's signature text is "Psychoactive Sacramentals: Essays on
Entheogens and Religion," which explores many facets of entheogenic use.
The book is an account of a 1995 conference held at the Chicago
Theological Seminary that was devoted to the subject of entheogens and
religion.


The council also has published Huston Smith's book, "Cleansing the Doors
of Perception: The Religious Significance of Entheogenic Plants and
Chemicals," a text that tackles the issue of drugs and spirituality in a
series of wide-ranging essays.


Smith, 83, is a religious scholar and author of many books, including "The
World's Religions," the most widely used textbook on its subject for more
than 30 years. He also has produced three series for public television:
"The Religions of Man," "The Search for America" and (with Arthur Compton)
"Science and Human Responsibility."


In other words, Smith certainly is no fly-by-night bohemian just looking
for a high. "I was extremely fortunate in having some entheogenic
experiences, while the substances were not only legal, but respectable,"
Smith said, talking about his early experimentation with LSD, in a 2001
Salon magazine interview. "It seemed like only fair play that since I
value those experiences immensely to do anything I could to enable a new
generation to also have such experiences without the threat of going to
jail."


Criminalizing peaceful people who use psychoactive drugs to deepen their
spiritual experience or widen their cognitive horizons is criminal itself,
these groups argue.


Their arguments are catching on.

Subject: [sfraves] Black lights + Gear for sale.. 



Hey Everyone,

Well in case you missed my posting the first time here it is again.

I have a bunch of party throwing gear that im looking to get rid of since I 
don't plan to do parties anymore.

Here is what is for sale:

9 Black light balase rods with 4 ft black light tubes (one tube is missing 
from the balase)
Plastic carrying tub filled with Rope,Fishing line,Brand new Duct tape,Tack 
Hammer with staples etc..

Several 50FT BRAND NEW extension cords the heavy duty Orange types.. along 
with several 6 outlet powerstrips and a couple of standard house type 
extension cords.
2 Brand New boxes of 1000 FT. 6 mil Black Tarping.. "That garbage bag type 
stuff" that you see at parties that cover the walls or corners etc.. And I 
think I have a few other things to throw in..

If you were to price this stuff out individually it would cost you several 
hundred dollars easily.. I have enough stuff to supply a small 200 person 
party.. And most of the gear is either still new in the package or used only 
once or twice..

I will let it all go for $150 for everything.. I just need to clear out my 
garage.

If interested hit me up private stylie


Macadio

coolness. i didn't know you were a makeup artist. :) :):) :) :) :)...i don't have a leather corset yet, because i have not seen one that i like or rather that suits me...there is a difference...i like to dress...my most recent purchase in the realm of glamour = awesome price...$20.00...insane for what i got...a brand new, floor length black silk gown...has a lace and silk train in the back and a lace, black bustier up top....i was shocked when i saw the price tag...i love it...makes me look like a witch. :)

 

Did you know lipsticks and cosmetics are pretty much manufactured in about
three major companies across the countries and then they are shipped out to
L'Oreal, Prescriptives what ever, who repackage and mark them up insanely.
There is not much difference in products unless you are looking into skin
care.

My make-up instructor said "it is all about the application not the product
she could use mud and make it work."

As well as a make-up artist, I have direct access to some of these
manufacturers and lipsticks and shadows for about $2's plus depending on
which dazzling solution you are into. Perhaps if you are all dying to break
away from the system perhaps I can arrange to share the scoop.
And well the Bondage I have tips for that to but I will get into that when I
know you better, but to start every women should own a leather corset, not
the PVC crap either. Nothing beats the feeling of leather on your skin.

know that i am sort
of writing to an audience of sorts, and i know what
that means....anyway, i was having a chat with a group
of ladies who were in a good mood, and we were all
enjoying
speaking freely about lace and cosmetics as many girls
do, and one of them recommended this book that is
called something like, "Don't Go To The Cosmetics
Counter Without Me",
and basically what that book and our conversation
is/was about is that you should be careful not to get
too
wound up in how much your products cost, but buy for
quality...okay? okay...so, back to lipsticks
again...i've been buying a few lipsticks...there are
some new kinds...you can get lipstick with a sunscreen
in
it now...there are also a lot of sheer color lipsticks
available (i've been wearing a few different sheers
made by loreal...they are all very pretty and they
smell sweet)....some of them are shiney...like a lip
gloss, but are rich in color like a lipstick...oh, and
then there are still the ones that are creme, frost or
have a matte finish to them...one girl recommended
that i try one
of those kinds of lipsticks that you paint the color
on first, then let it dry, and then you paint a
moisterizer over the top of it, and then when you kiss
or drink tea, it doesn't come off....i think that i
might not like those, so i haven't bought any
yet...maybe later...i imagine that they might be
drying, and i don't mind reapplying...that is part of
the fun....reapplying...especially in public
places...i have some lipsticks that aren't supposed to
be long wearing like
that, but they do just basically stain your lips and
not come off anyway for whatever reason, and i don't
like that...i mean, once, i put vaseline on my lips
something like three times in a row and wiped firmly
across
my mouth, and there was still i pink stain there, and
it was kind of disturbing..maybe i might like
something like that at another time, which is why i
didn't throw the two
lipstick that i have like that that aren't supposed
to be long wearing but are away...oh, this is getting
kind of long...i can't believe your still reading,
especially if your not interested...why do you do
that...just delete..i do...okay, so bondage...i used
to have a
really good book on bondage and i can't remember the
name of it, but it had a black cover and it was
hardcovered, and well, you can make your own decisions
and all
about lipsticks and bondage and such, but there are
some things that you should make yourself aware of, if
you are not already aware...like things like flogging
can potentially kill a person or tying them up the
wrong way could seriously injure them...there's a
whole science
behind the bondage s/m scene...so, if i can remember
the name of the book, i'll try to remember to post it,
but basically do your homework and read up on stuff,
and don't let someone you don't trust put their hands
on you...i haven't come across too many people in my
life who are totally hardcore, but i have had some
things come up where basically, i had to help
people...i had to do things like find a good and
trustworthy
professional take care of my mates for me...so,
anyway, i guess you could learn a few things from the
folsom street fair or something...i've just been
thinking about
this a lot lately, because i see a lot of people
becoming more interested in the scene, but also, maybe
they shouldn't
be becoming directly involved in any serious s/m role
playing games until they know what they are
doing...you have to be completly honest with
yourself...i mean, firstly, you have to be emotionally
mature...there's purpose and intent in
everything...good intentions are meaningless when
anyone gets hurt..also, just because you are enjoying
your fantasy, doesn't mean that anyone else
is.....like, for example, when i go out dancing or to
a small party, i don't like the smell of some
strangers or
even friends having sex...body odor is just that, and
also, i don't get off on anyone else's
business....things happen though, i know, i see, and i
am just tolerant up to a point....okay, over and out,
even though this was probably gett'in darned good for
you. :)

--=====================_7722732==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I'm in perfect agreement with you, John.  This whole intrusive security 
issue is a relatively recent development in the EDM community.  I can tell 
you from personal experience --  prior to the late nineties the only 
security check at 21+ club parties was presentation of a driver's license 
or other "official" ID.  There was no body pat or, even worse, examination 
of personal items.  At "raves" or other underground events there was no or 
minimal "security":  usually some big guy to run the door so that crowds 
didn't build on the street and alert the authorities to the event.

When this practice began at 1015 I was horrified.  And I stopped going to 
1015.  Period.  Further, if I know I must undergo intrusive security check 
at a party I will avoid that event, that's how strongly I feel about 
this.  I really detest having some stranger violate my person as the price 
of admission to a party.  Ruins my vibe.  I believe this is no way to 
welcome guests.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Security at parties...



I'll weigh in on this topic.

 First there are a handful of good security outfits. Arnie is great, so ASSEM 
event management, as well as Centennial Security. Security, in certain 
numbers, is often a requirement for permits in SF and Oak. And a requirement 
for renting certain venues. Often there is more than enough security because 
non ravers set security standards that don't really apply to the needs of a 
rave. The general rule of thumb for events is 1 per 100 people. I can't speak 
to underground's but it is not hypocritical for a promoter to ask attendee's 
to "respect the underground" and than have lisc., fully bonded security. 
 Also searches aren't always to stop drugs or pens. How about weapons? I was 
at an event where a stick of dynamite was confiscated.
 There were no old days without security except pre-94, its just that now 
they are licensed and wear a uniform. This sucks and hurts the vibe, but its 
better than some buffed friend of the promoters stealing some kids bag of pot 
under the guise of security.
 The best most constructive thing to do is to email promoter and tell them 
what security companies you liked and why. Did a certain company treat the 
people kindly and without using fear tactics? Was a certain company rude or 
rough? By dialoging with promoter you can help shape the type of companies 
that are used, because security is here to stay.
 I agree that the "empty out your pockets and slow down the line routine" is 
unless and not effective. 
 And once ravers understand the concept of a trash can maybe candy and gum 
will be allowed to venues on a more regular basis. Anyone who has scraped gum 
off the floor the day after will tell you that candy than becomes a 
privilege, not a right, for attendees. Partially people have themselves to 
blame. If people want to have pens in events how about stopping tagers and 
being a little self policing around issues like that. How about pointing out 
destructive tager in events.
 The R in PLUR stands for respect. And while I won't defend bad security and 
their behavior I must say that:...... If ravers want respect than they at 
this point need to earn it by acting without destruction and with some 
mindfulness as to what has to happen to venues after they leave. There are 
venues that won't rent to rave promoters because of the reputation of ravers 
as being especially messy and leaving a ton of trash. The worst thing about 
the reputation is it is true. Ravers leave more trash than clubbers, hip 
hoppers, hippies and granola folk. Ravers are the most trash intensive group 
ever and certainly promoters flyers all on the ground contributes to that.
 It like the thread about what happened to cheep parties but no one wants to 
acknowledge that janitorial is now a thousands of dollars expense for a mid 
size party.
 Also having security is a good buffer for quasi-permitted parties from not 
getting shut down. It shows thought and planning and an attempt at 
responsibility by the promoter. It is also not cheep, so promoter who do hire 
security are not cutting conners.
 On the other hand the security at 1015 IS exactly why I don't go there 
either.

You know, I'm probably more guilty than most about over-emphesizing the
negative, and skipping over the positive when I talk about parties after the
fact.  Suffice it to say, when I go out I *DO* have a good time usually, these
negatives aside.  Obviously, I wouldn't keep going to parties if I didn't.  And
yeah... promoters don't get enough credit.  Hell, just having been on the crew
of a few parties in these last few months showed me just how crap they have to
go through.

Thing with security COMPANIES, is that I don't trust organizations.  I trust
individuals.  I'm more likely, by far, to remember what security was like by
the party then what it was like by the company.  Hell, I don't even know what
Arnie calls his group.

And, from a partie-goer's POV, Arnie is tops if you HAVE to have strict
security.  All of the other times security has been hella strict, it's been
VERY thug-like.  Cases in point: 1015, the maratime, and the sweets parties
including and following Hope.

If *I* were throwing my own party, and I had no choice but it have tight
security (ie. the venue forces me to do so at the last minute, or the popo's
threaten me with arrest otherwise, and in both cases it's too late to switch to
a new venue/town) I'd hire Arnie.  And if he wasn't available, I'd reschedule
the party.  My more natural inclination though, is to go with my prior example:
"Treat everyone with respect and dignity at the door, and have a couple of big
people on staff in case someone needs to be ejected.".

See, to my mind, the sort of people who would carry or own most weapons should
never have found out about the party in the first place, and said example is an
example of someone giving a flyer to the wrong person.  Tho when I think in
terms of intercepting weapons, I'm thinking of guns and knives.  And I have to
admit... that stick of dynamite stumps me.  Granted, I played with my share of
explosives (For a long time, my anti-drug was blowing stuff up.) back in school
when I had access to chemistry labs.  But I can't even fathom what would prompt
someone to bring dynamite to a party.

>  There were no old days without security except pre-94,

I don't want to get in a big arguement about what constitutes the "old days",
but recent parties off the top of my head:

Imagine Us In Wonderland
One of the Family
Camp Unity
Amalgamation
'Ard Attack
Herbonium
DisFUNKshun
When the Nightmare Ends
Deviance (Not sure if this one really counts... the cops DID show up and make
them shut down the music, but they didn't clear the place out... everyone
stayed and chilled sans music)

Now, I was not on the crew for any of these, and have only a small bit of
"behind the scenes" info on them.  For all I know, there could've been a dozen
or more security types disguised in the crowd.  Though knowing the promoters of
most of those, I doubt it.  But they're all examples of EXCELLENT parties I had
a badass time at, where security (if any) was completely invisible.  And if
there WERE any "incidents" they were taken care of discretely and without
disrupting the party.  And with the exception of Deviance, did not suffer from
porcine disruption.

Do *I* know how to do it?  No.  But it CAN be done.  I've SEEN it happen.

>  The best most constructive thing to do is to email promoter and tell them 
>  what security companies you liked and why.

Yah... I *DO* fall too much on the "bitch on mailing lists side".  I'll try to
remember this one.

gum

I feel your pain on the "gum on the floor" thing.  Hell... I've SAT in enough
gum (and had to take the WD-40 to the pants) to want to throttle those bastards
who spit their gum out on the floor.  But I'm sure that MOST people don't dump
theit gum on the floor, and we're back to another of my (gawd, I feel like I'm
being self-centered today) pet peeves: collective punishment.  I could rant for
hours about how despicable it is to punish the innocent for the actions of the
guilty.  I won't, though, as I want to get off the computer SOMETIME tonight.

SFRaves has seen more than it's share of "wasteful or littering flyers"
threads.  No need to comment there.  I'm definately 100% in the "small flyers
carefully handed out to the right people" camp.

One small bit on the trash can issue tho.  All too often there are NOT ENOUGH
trash cans in a party!  That's no excuse for gum on the floor, of course.  I'll
damn well swallow MY gum if I can't get to a trash can easily.  But more cans,
more often emptied would've helped the litter situation at more than a few
parties I've been to.

I'm still suprised that water bottles are such a big part of rave litter tho. 
The bloody things are recycleable, after all.  One practice of some promoters
(UNITY, off the top of my head), which I'm suprised hasn't been adopted more
widely is to take used water bottles back at the sale area in exchange for a
discount on your next bottle.  (ie.  The first bottle is full price... say $3. 
Return an empty, and your next one is $1.  I've been in Costco as often as many
people.  Even $1/bottle turns a profit on water).  That would ease the pressure
on the trash cans.  All the empties would be in one place for easy bagging and
recycleing.  And hell... some cheapskates would do part of your cleanup for
you, just to get the discount on the water!  (Don't think it would happen? 
Hell, SFRaves' very own Osby has been known, on more than one occation, to
collect and bag up water bottles to take off for recycleing, even at parties on
which he's not on crew!).

It likely would not be economic to do the same with energy drinks and the like
(Again, I can compare prices at Costco as well as anyone).  But in a place so
environmentally concious as San Francisco, I have a hard time believing that
prominent and clearly marked bins for aluminium recycleing wouldn't recieve the
bulk of the Red Bull/Rockstar cans.  Hell, I've actually pestered the people at
water/drinks tables about recycleing bins on occasion.  (They only humored me
once, when I got to a party significantly early.  And who knows if that bin
REALLY went to recycleing instead of out with the rest of the trash.  But I DID
convince them to seperate out and mark a trashcan specificly for aluminium
once.)

I dunno.  Maybe it's stupid and naive.  But I really *DO* believe that MOST
people are basiclly good by default.  And they WILL do the right thing if you
give them the chance, instead of assumeing the worst from the beginning.


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Security at parties...

The thing with security, for me anyway, is that I really don't like it until 
I notice that it isn't there.  Last week at the party in Coloma there wasn't 
any door security when I went in.  No one was frisked and at first I thought 
it was cool.  But then I saw all of the "semi-shady thuggians" that were 
mean mugging all of the candy-kids and old skoolers.  That made me a little 
bit uncomfortable, but I ended up having a blast at the party and I danced 
my silly little ass off.  To my knowledge there weren't any problems other 
than the police breaking it up at 3am.  All in all a good party but I 
definately favor a moderate amount of security at public parties.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Security at parties...

This subject is kinda funny in the sense that......

I have thrown a party that people really hated my security. I threw
another one not too long after, and people praised me for getting new
security because the security at the last party was really really bad. 

Best part was, it was the same company both times, with the exact same
crew. 

But.....

It was a different venue, with different rules, and different contract.
So I had to instruct security to do different types of searches and
confiscate different types of materials. 

It all depends on the situation and venue of your event. I have thrown
events without security, and I have thrown them that they do a full
search and don't allow anything into the venue. 

In the end, it is what the venue wants, because without the venue, you
have no event.

See, to my mind, the sort of people who would carry or own most weapons
should
never have found out about the party in the first place, and said
example is an
example of someone giving a flyer to the wrong person.  Tho when I think
in

Camp Unity
Amalgamation

Now, I was not on the crew for any of these, and have only a small bit
of
"behind the scenes" info on them.  For all I know, there could've been a
dozen
or more security types disguised in the crowd.  Though knowing the
promoters of
most of those, I doubt it.  But they're all examples of EXCELLENT
parties I had
a badass time at, where security (if any) was completely invisible.  And
if
there WERE any "incidents" they were taken care of discretely and
without
disrupting the party.  And with the exception of Deviance, did not
suffer from
porcine disruption.

Do *I* know how to do it?  No.  But it CAN be done.  I've SEEN it
happen.

Yah... I *DO* fall too much on the "bitch on mailing lists side".  I'll
try to
remember this one.

I feel your pain on the "gum on the floor" thing.  Hell... I've SAT in
enough
gum (and had to take the WD-40 to the pants) to want to throttle those
bastards
who spit their gum out on the floor.  But I'm sure that MOST people
don't dump
theit gum on the floor, and we're back to another of my (gawd, I feel
like I'm
being self-centered today) pet peeves: collective punishment.  I could
rant for
hours about how despicable it is to punish the innocent for the actions
of the
guilty.  I won't, though, as I want to get off the computer SOMETIME
tonight.

SFRaves has seen more than it's share of "wasteful or littering flyers"
threads.  No need to comment there.  I'm definately 100% in the "small
flyers
carefully handed out to the right people" camp.

One small bit on the trash can issue tho.  All too often there are NOT
ENOUGH
trash cans in a party!  That's no excuse for gum on the floor, of
course.  I'll
damn well swallow MY gum if I can't get to a trash can easily.  But more
cans,
more often emptied would've helped the litter situation at more than a
few
parties I've been to.

I'm still suprised that water bottles are such a big part of rave litter
tho. 
The bloody things are recycleable, after all.  One practice of some
promoters
(UNITY, off the top of my head), which I'm suprised hasn't been adopted
more
widely is to take used water bottles back at the sale area in exchange
for a
discount on your next bottle.  (ie.  The first bottle is full price...
say $3. 
Return an empty, and your next one is $1.  I've been in Costco as often
as many
people.  Even $1/bottle turns a profit on water).  That would ease the
pressure
on the trash cans.  All the empties would be in one place for easy
bagging and
recycleing.  And hell... some cheapskates would do part of your cleanup
for
you, just to get the discount on the water!  (Don't think it would
happen? 
Hell, SFRaves' very own Osby has been known, on more than one occation,
to
collect and bag up water bottles to take off for recycleing, even at
parties on
which he's not on crew!).

It likely would not be economic to do the same with energy drinks and
the like
(Again, I can compare prices at Costco as well as anyone).  But in a
place so
environmentally concious as San Francisco, I have a hard time believing
that
prominent and clearly marked bins for aluminium recycleing wouldn't
recieve the
bulk of the Red Bull/Rockstar cans.  Hell, I've actually pestered the
people at
water/drinks tables about recycleing bins on occasion.  (They only
humored me
once, when I got to a party significantly early.  And who knows if that
bin
REALLY went to recycleing instead of out with the rest of the trash.
But I DID
convince them to seperate out and mark a trashcan specificly for
aluminium
once.)

I dunno.  Maybe it's stupid and naive.  But I really *DO* believe that
MOST
people are basiclly good by default.  And they WILL do the right thing
if you
give them the chance, instead of assumeing the worst from the beginning.


cya,
john

Hah hah... yeah... Are you sure you are asking on the right email list? 
;)  Contact FAB and "they" will probably get it to you directly... want 3 
copies... no problem... :0   Bum deal that they closed their web site, but 
I understand they will still do limited buying and possibly reopen the 
internet site eventually.

When is Amber-1 out? ;)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Security at parties...

it seems to me that parties where the security is the
most rigid and fascist are the ones i feel safest at -
in which case security is doing its job.

to me, the ideal security situation at a party is one
where you can just look around every once in a while
and know that someone, more than one person, is paying
attention to what's going on, taking responsibility.

working security at parties is a tough job and i don't
envy it of anyone.  some people are cut out for it, i
guess, but as for me... the fine line between just
keeping the peace or else harshing everyone's vibe is
one that would have trouble staying clear.

Subject: [sfraves] scene death?  what scene?

I have a serious question for everyone!

Is it me or is the "Scene" not only slower, but dieing a horrible =
agonizing and slow death?  I read everywhere how numbers are down, people =
arent coming out, everyone and there mom wants to hear rap or top 40 crap =
rather than house, etc.
Is a national phenomenon! =20

What is killing the scene?:
High price greedy djs/artists/record stores? Drugs? riaa?  influx of a =
million djs?  p l u r killed?  clear channel?  club owners?  sucky =
producers?

(the fcc raised the act requiring strict ownership for radio back in 96 =
and now they are trying to do the same with the media, including news.  =
BAD IDEA!!!!)
Is it bc people have turned this into a business now?
no music innovation?  economy?

Seriously!  What can we do to stop this before it is too late?  Some of us =
live for this, but it seems that anyone that has been in the "scene" for =
more than a year now is either a dj/promoter/artists or leaves it.  i have =
seen a mass turnover in my time and it seems that as the years go by the =
turnover becomes faster and more robust.
the only people who stay in the scene are the previous mentioned peoples, =
and even they have begun to realize that it seems success if futile.

In any case, if we do not stop this stuff below, this will be the final =
nail in the coffin.
i dont know about u but the govt has become too insane if you ask me.
it is time to give the people back their power, rather than giving it to =
govt.

Does anyone have a suggestion as to how, why or what can be done to at =
least stop (or reverse) the trend that seems to be going on, especially =
since 2000?
I have my own ideas, but am up for suggestions!

Or even better we paint the building like a giant american flag and have it
be the american symbol of music. Instant terrorist target. Or we could do
the flag building and have it moved to Baghdad. How long do you think it
would remain standing and what do you think they would do to Ms Rosen?

I dunno... Al Qaeda would suddenly become global heroes. There'd be a lot of
conflicting emotions, you know... which makes for good songwriting. Which
would be better for music. Hmmm...  Hey terrorists, are you listenin'?

Whoa there Hondo!

Hahah while I personally do not like the RIAA, business is business;
and I *do* respect their craftiness-

But they've already dug their own grave, and little things like this
aren't going to change that.
And I personally have been enjoying watching them squirm.

To me, the MPAA is *much* more viscious organization.
(See DeCSS)
And well, they're much smarter too- that's why you can buy a DVD for
$10 but the soundtrack to that same movie costs $16 :D

Hahah.. well, I found the real mindfuck the other night. As I was going
through the Pop/Rock CD section at Tower, I thought I'd take a look at the
section for The Cure.

A couple of years ago, all of The Cure's back catalogue was raised to full
price for some reason. With current pricing, that places their albums at
$18.99 apiece. They had a few import versions of some of the CDs...
stickered at $17.99.  What's wrong with this picture?

This is the same problem that has plagued Japanese CDs for years. The
imports (American ones in particular) often ended up being cheaper than the
domestics. Of course, over there, they started adding value by putting a ton
of bonus tracks on albums, which is why the Japanese imports were always so
cool. Unfortunately, the American recording industry's take on this is to

truly.

everyone taking responsibility for their own safety is
most ideal, although to some this means carrying a
weapon.  anyway.  i think the sum of what i was trying
to say is that security should lead to a more relaxed
atmosphere, not more tense.

Well, an easy way to personally do something about the RIAA is to
boycott their member labels.  And it's easy enough to find out who they
are: http://www.riaa.org/About-Members-1.cfm

Can't say these folks are at the forefront of exciting music.

Yes, and this is the spirit of an "underground."  I don't know what parties 
people are going to, but I haven't been to an event with a "pat down" and 
such for over a year.  Even at Tantra, which was a publicly advertised 
event which attracted a couple of thousand, there was no intrusive security.

To my mind, "security" at a "rave" is absurd.  We can fuss about terms, but 
a mass market party in a venue which requires heavy security and 
confiscation of private items like breath mints, inspection of bags and 
other personal items, is not a "rave."  Raves are family events that are 
carefully promoted to those who are highly unlikely to bring spray paint, 
knives, and other dangerous items to the party.  Eh?  I mean...really.

At our parties we have what we call "safety."  The emphasis here is on the 
safety of our guests, and that includes protecting the event from being 
shut down by the authorities,  karma patrol, having an EMT available for 
any medical emergency, and the like.  Our guests are treated as one would 
treat a friend visiting one's home.  We assume that those who attend these 
parties are responsible and look after each other.

Love,

Apollo

It depends on what scene you mean:)

The club scene in San Francisco these days is in some trouble.  There are 
fewer people able and willing to pay $20.00 cover and spend $6.00 or more 
for drinks.  Those with disadvantageous lease arrangements made in the .com 
era that require heavy cover and bar take are going to have to restructure 
to survive.  On the other hand, more venue spaces seem to be opening up, 
with more realistic financial requirements, so we may see some 
revitalization of clubbing on a more modest scale in future.  The days when 
one paid someone like Donald Glaude thousands to spin and met him at the 
airport with a Hummer are gone for awhile, I think.  Not something I 
particularly miss.  Lots of good, new talent out there.

I personally have been to very few club events in the past year.  When I do 
go, I frequent places like Club 6 where "security" is non-existent and one 
can be comfortable and free inside.  I am way past the point where I am 
going to pay to be frisked.  Others feel this way, especially the old house 
crowd.  One of the problems Come-Unity had at the end was finding a place 
where people who have been dancing for over ten years didn't have to be 
treated like criminals.

I believe, therefore, that we have entered an era where mass market 
promoters, DJs and the like must have lowered expectations 
financially.  Party goers, on the other hand, expect lower prices and 
better treatment at the events they attend, especially the house music 
crowd and others who have been dancing for years and felt alienated by 
things like VIP rooms, poor treatment by staff, and lack of family vibe at 
parties.

If you are talking about the underground scene, however, I personally think 
there is a growing appetite for these parties.  Many have been 
disillusioned with the late nineties club culture in the Bay and are 
looking for off the map parties where the vibe is more intimate.  Even some 
"permitted" events these days are positioned as "undergrounds" because 
promoters are discovering that this is attractive.  Low prices.  Often the 
absence of costly booze.  Good talent.  Old friends environment.  God 
knows, in a world that is becoming increasingly dark and violent (hell, 
last night two college frat houses had a rumble and one kid was killed), 
folks aren't going to pay for more conflict and dissonance in their free 
time.  The underground did, and does, provide at its best a welcome break 
from life's turmoil -- that old temporary autonomous zone -- where people 
can be with those they prefer in non-judgmental milieu.

This change, to me, is a good thing.

As for the EDM scene outside of the Bay -- I get emails these days from 
people all over the world who have somehow got hold of House Music 101 and 
share with me their passion for house and their very energetic local 
scenes.  The most recent was from a DJ in Romania.  Many of these scenes 
are in relatively poor places where they haven't been able to make the 
equation EDM=money yet.  Exciting.  Hard times breed innovation.

Ten years ago when the rave community was beginning here there was a poor 
economy, life and death struggle with AIDS for many in the music scene, war 
with Iraq -- a time many considered dark also.  Out of that pain came one 
of the most vibrant dance and music cultures I have seen since seventies 
New York.  I say -- get ready for another paradigm buster.  Change is in 
the air.

Love,

Apollo

I think what Yarrow is referring to is security at permitted, larger
events. There was never a time when you could get away with throwing an
event at a civic center or arena without having to invest in security
presence - it's simply a requirement for getting a permit. Even the
viberation parties we did at CZ had security, because the USCA (co-op
central office) required a written contract with a bonded security company
to allow a party to hapen.

The parties you mentioned, John, were all semi-legal undergrounds, which
are held to different standards: permits and legal venues drive up the
overhead costs of an event exponentially, which need to be recouped by
larger crowds, who need to be attracted by largr flyers and pushier
advertising, and who are statistically more likely to include
unpredictable assholes, etc. etc. you get the idea. There have always been
security-free parties on the fringes of the law, but they need to remain
small by definition - woe to the underground promoter who tries to go big
without being legit as well. "Every situation contains the seeds of its
own demise."

That said, there are varying degrees of "security" in various situations.
Most undergrounds I've seen typically have Big T or the equivalent hanging
out at the front door - a far cry from all the dickwads in red jackets who
prowled the front entrance to the Maritime.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] scene death?  what scene?


Thanks Apollo, some great comments as usual.

To me, it seems like there is a bored feeling that has been going around
for some time now...  It's almost as if the oldness of the /scene/ /style/
/music/ is pushing people away.

Before I go too far I should say that I still do believe there is
evolution here, the music obviously does everyday, and events do to a
certain degree.  But likie Apollo phrased it, a 'paradigm buster' would
really do it.

We see old-schoolers and grizzled veterans going off on new people in the
scene, and that has to be less than alluring to new participants.  On the
other hand, we see those same old-schoolers getting bored, and constantly
looking for something better (myself included).

In my opinion I believe that we need two things in order to rejuvinate
this culture we love:  new energy, and new ideas.

New energy:  People, groups, styles and movements.

New ideas:  Fresh clothing ideas, New event concepts, new experiential
excersises.  New ideas that don't even really relate to dance music, yet.

The /scene/ has always been about Doin' It Yourself.  Take whatever is
exciting to you, and integrate that in with groups and events.  Probably
other people will find it interesting as well.

Push it forward!

"On the other hand, we see those same old-schoolers getting bored, and
constantly looking for something better (myself included)." - Ed Colmar

This seems to be the topic of the week. I just had a fairly large thread
about my similar feelings a few days ago in livejournal. I have a partial
solution that will hopefully appease those feeling bored and dissallusioned
within our culture. One of the biggest detractors lately is motivation. A
lot of us just won't motivate ourselves to go out anymore. It's easier to
sit back and whine about how much things suck. I'm guilty of this. I want to
change it however. The focus needs to return to the friends and the energy
those friends bring with them. All of us need to be excited about being in
the same room together again.

Who's down for an SFR houseparty? Eastbay location, 2x4 setup with SWAT
Sound, plenty of parking and cool neighbors. Oh and easy freeway access.
Interested in doing something fun and meeting your fellow listers?

Lemme know... First 50 people this Friday and we can go until you pass out.

DRUGS AND TERROR DON'T MIX

Opinion By Glenn Backes
The San Francisco Chronicle
January 17th, 2003

It is one thing to have our intelligence insulted by advertisers
attempting to separate us from our money. It is quite another when
our own government uses our tax dollars to spread disinformation, as
with new TV ads linking drug use in America to terrorism.

In the latest attempt to bolster public support (and funding) for the
failed war on drugs, the White House has unleashed a slick ad series
featuring fictional debaters, Nick and Norm, two middle-aged white
businessmen dining at an expensive restaurant, talking drugs and
terror. In four 30-second vignettes, their argument plays out. After
initial resistance, the dark-haired one concedes a connection between
drug money and terror. He maintains, however, that the amount
is "peanuts" and that "If I buy drugs, I might be supporting terror.
Might is the moral loophole."

The gray-haired hero, appalled by this rationalization, responds, "If
you buy drugs, you might be helping drug dealers shoot little kids --
and you might be helping terrorists do things so awful that we cannot
conceive of them yet."

What is especially galling about this campaign is that it propagates
lies about not one, but two of the Bush administration's priorities:
a moral crusade to end drug use in America, and a military crusade to
control the Middle East. It suggests that our allies, the good guys
who helped depose the Taliban and search for bin Laden don't deal
drugs (they do), and that Americans who buy drugs fund terrorism
(they don't).

In the days before the attack on the World Trade Center, the Taliban
was an ally to the Bush administration in the war on drugs. Less than
four months before al Qaeda's horrifying attacks in 2001, officials
of the State Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration
certified that the Taliban had effectively eradicated opium
production in the sections of Afghanistan that they controlled, with
remaining production coming primarily from sectors under control of
the Northern Alliance.

After the attacks, the Bush administration chose to ally itself with
the Northern Alliance. Since the fall of the Taliban, opium
production in Afghanistan has reached levels never before seen in
that country.

The State Department getting into bed with Afghan drug dealers is old
hat, of course. In the 1980s, the United States turned a blind eye to
the drug money commingling with our tax dollars in the fight against
the Soviets. In Central America, the Reagan covert war machine
condoned (if not facilitated) cocaine trafficking to the United
States in order to fund the Contras against the Sandinista government
in Nicaragua.

Bush's claim that U.S. drug use funds terrorism is not only
hypocritical, it is untrue. The illegal drug Americans prefer is
marijuana, grown for the most part within our own borders by American
citizens with no connections to international drug cartels, much less
terror networks. Ecstasy and LSD are either made here or imported
from Western Europe. Cocaine, and to a growing extent heroin, is
imported from South America and Mexico. Heroin continues to flow into
the United States from Southeast Asia.

Both Bush's foreign enemies (such as the Marxist rebel FARC in
Colombia) and allies (the Northern Alliance and numerous officials of
all Latin American governments) gain wealth from the drug trade. But
if the FARC and Northern Alliance were destroyed and every corrupt
official from here to the tip of Chile died of old age, the drug
cartels would still prosper, enriched by the drug prohibition
economy.

What "moral loophole" justifies Bush's lies and hypocrisy? Does he
think that if he tells us that drug use is as bad as terrorism, we
might let him waste billions more again next year on prisons in
pursuit of his utopian vision of a drug-free society?

The American public is clearly sick of the failed drug war. The
majority of us support alternatives to prison for nonviolent drug
offenders and other alternatives to this cruel and expensive farce.

Glenn Backes is director of the California capital office of the Drug
Policy Alliance.

This is a pretty deep issue that I'm sure has been scoured on every level
by the good ol boys.

Unfortunately, the statement that 'drug sales fund terroism' is true, just
not in the way they are intending it.

Contrary to many people's beliefs that drug sales are not taxed, and none
of that money finds its way into the hands of the government.  Much of the
high level sales are in fact taxed.  Not that people are claiming drug
sales on thier income taxes, but writing them into thier small businesses,
or claiming the cash as ticket sales.  Somehow making it seem like this
huge wad of cash they just aquired illegaly can make it into thier bank
account, and it is hence getting taxed.  So we can say, that "drug sales
fund the United States".

As the US is the number one terroist organization in the world.  The
statement "paying your taxes fuels terrorism" is true, and equally true
is the statement in question "drug sales fund terroism".

I find it really amusing that they can admit this fact so openly.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] scene death?  what scene?

  Time for an old fart to pip in. Here is my two cents.
Back in the day, 91, the scene was all new to everyone.
So we open up ourselves to the music, people and the vibe.
But as time went on and people got more and more jaded from greedy promoters, fat headed DJ's and people who did not hole the truths of PEACE,LOVE,UNITY and RESPECT above them selves.
 I teach teens in a group I'm with to hole PLUR as a way of life.Do unto others, ya know. But to me the scene is like watching TV. The shows just start getting old. Do we turn off the TV and do something more with our life's? Or do we pull together and start something new?
 I went to my first Friends and Family Camp out last summer.
It renewed my faith in what we can do to create an vibe about Peace Love Unity and Respect. I truly believe it must come from the people putting on the parties. By creating a place where people who deserve to be there come together. Make it invite only, map point.Then when people get to the spot. They are greeted and given a gift. This gift is the party. They should treat it and the people who are there as such.Mostly they should treat themselves with as much love and respect as they would expect it from others. 
 I hope I was not to long winded and I got my point across.
Love is the LAW.

Uh oh.. With the exception of the odd event or special, I gave up and
stopped watching TV over a year ago. d'Oh!

I think that would make for a great party, sure - but it's short-sighted,
IMO. The party would be great, only people you want to be with are there,
which might be fun - but then what? Like TV, the same old thing with the
same old people will get old. And as far as I'm concerned, having an
invite-only party might be exclusive and unlikely to get busted, but it goes
against the spirit of raving that I learned back in the day.

One of my first raves was in some ways stereotypical. It was in some
warehouse, thrown by a collective of artists, and a friend who wasn't all
that close took me, after he had heard about it from an acquaintance of his.
I only knew that one person, and we were pretty much strangers to the whole
crowd. However, from the moment we arrived, we were made very welcome. I was
a complete stranger but there were no harsh stares, no silent looks of "who
brought YOU?" and no judgements. I knew at that point that it would be a
great night.

I know things have changed since then. I know that things have become more
commercialized. I know that it's harder to keep something small and special
since it's all become so big and public. But I hardly think that roping off
a party is the solution to all that. In my eyes, it's not much better than a
club with a VIP room...

Rave or club, the whole scene is in need of more innovation.  Fat times 
usually create boredom and repetition.  Consider, for example, the gay club 
scene.  Used to be when one went to a queer underground club one heard 
cutting edge music and experienced a tight subcultural vibe.  Then came 
assimilation, commercialization, and the circuit scene.  Same DJs at EVERY 
event, same music, same look -- formulaic, like the porn side of it 
all.  Predictable.  And then, there was no longer a "philosophical" or 
political side to the subculture become mainstream -- oppression creates 
one hell of a party vibe:)

Now consider most of the "commercial" parties around town, rave or 
otherwise.  Again, one usually sees the same names spinning.  Lack of 
creative production values.  Everyone marketing to the same 
crowd.  Segmentation of parties by genres.  Lack of content beyond music.

I think we are seeing some break out of this mold.  People are 
experimenting with new genres at some parties.  Some promoters are seeing 
the value of bringing together the often separated tribes, like psytrance, 
house, techno, hip hop and breaks dancers under one roof.  There have been 
events not advertised on this list where there are regular dance contests 
with prizes, BMX competitions at parties, and art collaborations.  I see 
more and more altars and symbology at events.

Parties in the early nineties were often the merger of new, fresh music 
with the visual arts.  Participants created their own "body" 
art.  Performance art was the rule rather than the exception.  Lots of new, 
unknown DJs and talent.  The emergence of a subculture with implied shared 
values.  Content.

As I said in a prior post, these times are much like those days.  Boredom 
and some pain and darkness are great motivators.  If you're a good promoter 
and you see people aren't coming to your parties, you seek new ways to 
entertain and delight your guests.  And I don't mean by this that you 
plaster naked boobs and pecs all over your fliers....been there, overdone 
that:)

Love,

Apollo

Subject: RE: [sfraves] scene death?  what scene?

Speaking of, I just went to a Psytrance event this past weekend that was
also promoted to the goth/ industrial scene and consciously outreached
to that scene. So we have psytrance, which is pretty much known for its
freaky, kinda more earthly flavor (mention campout to a psytrance junky
and witness the drool) -- getting along with the goth and industrial
sector, a place where psy has its roots in. It was promoted to both
usually separate and distinct groups.

We need more parties like these, where the various flavors of freaks mix
and meld into one. It was a conscious effort to promote SCENE
GLOBABLIZATION.

The idea isn't original, but the creativity that was spawned is. So why
is it that we don't have an 80's / indie rock room next to our techno?
Or how about early industrial mixed with house? I wonder the types of
people that would show up for that....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] scene death?  what scene?

I tend to agree with Apollo here.  I think
cross-pollentation of musical styles brings together a
more diverse and ecclectic group of people.

Also, if people are encouraged to participate and
contribute to the party in terms of the overall
experience, not just the music, then people walk away
with a greater sense of association and
accomplishment.

It is worth noting that participation does not
necessarily have to be orchestrated with the event
promoters - spontaneity is just as important.

Peace,
Thomas

i find that the scene is very much alive. it is simply an evolving thing. there are always plenty of things to do, and every party is different and unique, so you can't judge the direction the scene is taking by what is past.  just my opinion of F-A-C-T. party on, duuuuuuuuuudddddeeeee....oh, more about undies, for the undie lover inclined...depending on where 

you started and where your headed, the scene mightly has always had a lot to do with your undies,  your tiny tops and your bikinis and latex paints...if it hasn't, you haven't been going to any REAL 

parties or, your on drugs! anyways, tis the season of love, and BIG BRAS for even the daintiest of bustlines....someone gave me a huge bra, meaning, it has tons of padding 

and wires and stuff, and when i put it on, one of my friends said, "i've never seen you quite so uplifted!".....anyone who is blessedly huge, would think i appear to be sort of average, however, i can't stop looking down at my current rack....it is ridiculous. i tend not to wear that kind of stuff too much, but i suppose it can be a fun trend to go totally varga girl, but i also rather like just looking a bit closer to my natural state....a BIG BIT closer....:)

--part1_12.2c0dad97.2b60da0d_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm doing a survey for a class and wanted to know: 
With the advent of other forms of entertainment such as film, video and 
reality TV, is live theatre relevant? Why or why not?

*To add a little perspective:
-number of people that go to the theatre per year- 120 million
-number of people that go see top ten movies every year- 350 million + 
another billion

When answering, please include your full name, age and occupation, and try to 
respond privately since this is NRR... unless all of you feel it is a 
worthwhile topic to discuss. Thanks. : )

heart,
Alida

Subject: Re: [sfraves] scene death?  what scene?

I'm gonna try to weigh in on the whole thread, because so many great ideas
have been posted. I wrote this kinda fast, and tried to be brief, so apologies
on grammar or lack in clarity:

On scene death...
I've always thought it interesting as our scene came to rise and decline,
because (imho) the driving force of the undergrounds stayed
constant. I was in the interesting position to associate myself w/ the UG
crews, but kept tabs on the big scene by continually being booked for
massives. It got more and more ridiculous as mainstream parties broke out,
almost like the dotcoms. But just as the dotcoms have been forced to adapt
or die, mainstream parties are forced to do the same. At the same time,
the void left by UG veteran crews, who have either retreated to
their own circles or declined out of age, has not been filled...as of yet.

On fads....
I never really thought a lot of the people going to raves in the late 90's
knew enough about it to appreciate it. It was a fad. Some of us would like
to believe the rave scene is more of a movement...but is it? Surely some
of us have experienced life-changing transformations, but is our
philosophy and culture enough to be timeless? What makes us any more of a
movement than breakdancing, any less than hippies?

On subjectivity....
One thing I learned in my time with you all is that the more I
learn, I less I realize I know. Kinda like how you think you have it *all
figured out* by the time you're 18, but 10 years later you realize you
knew very little. This scene lives by the quality of its subjective
experience. The magic that I felt at a certain time in my life was not
absolute, and later on in my involvement here I found the same enjoyment
seeing others experience the same magic. So there really is no timetable,
it's what we make of it, and what we decide to share with others.

On my own involvement...
I feel like a schmuck for not contributing as much recently as I probably
could. We threw a bunch of really good parties several years ago, but now
they're probably a distant memory. The concept behind our parties really
never caught on, perhaps partially because we never threw-for-profit, and only
struck when the iron was hot and our conditions met, but we learned a lot.
I sucessfully dealt with the authorites on lots of occasions. I know how
to *not* blow a circuit. I know how to set up a party that won't fall down
at 1am. These days, I'm more concerned about keeping a roof over my head
than entertaining a bunch of folks.
It seems though, that lots of the same general party throwing questions come
up here. I noticed Yarrow came out candid on this list, which I normally
wouldn't expect from a massive promoter.I guess I'm saying that I still think
more resources are on this list than some would expect. I'm glad this dialogue
is taking place, and hope we continue to talk about it.

On elitism...
I believe this was brought about through necessity, not egomania. There
was a time, as some would remember, when Friends and Family planned
parties on this list. Eventually the list just became too big for them,
And soon after, became too dangerous to post any UG events here. Those
groups who have left the spotlight never needed to come back. It just
became way easier to *not* have an open-door to the rave community. And at this
point, I don't think any of them are coming back, which leads me to...

On reinvention....
All the ideas posted on this thread are golden. Far different than a few
years ago when the general scene mentality was "gimme gimme gimme". To
question your involvement in a scene/fad/movement and reevaluate that scene
shows that we are ready for the next step. What is the next step? I have no
idea what floats all your people's boat. Personally, I'd like to see some well
produced, family-oriented, safe, truly-innovative, from-the-heart parties
(whatever that means). I remember being a "scenester" in '96 and having my
rave world turned upside down by FnF $5 parties with full on
*everything*, that was legendary shit. I'd like to see new crews/families
emerge with the knowledge of their predecessors and make it better. It's clear
to me there are still a lot of great people in the scene, many veterans have
been scorched and are apprehensive, many others have fresh ideas to bring
to the table. Ultimately, it's up to our collective force to decide where we
go from here.

Thanks for listening, I almost feel like there was a point to everything I
said that never came out. Oh well, maybe it did, maybe it'll come out
later.

take care,

-terry

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: Theatre, relevant or not?(long)

***I am posting this to SFR because dammit this is something I feel
incredibly passionate about, more than most anything in my life. Whereas
raving has saved many of us on the list, theatre saved mine.***

Oh my goodness I could write a book on this subject...

I have been involved with live theatre for over 10 years now...god that
seems long! I have three associates degrees in technical theatre, acting and
direction but decided to forgo Theatre as a bachelors degree because what
director gives a crap if you have a degree. They want to know if you can DO.
I have been a techie building sets, hanging lights, running the board, and I
have been involved in 30 something (my bf counted I have not) productions
from Shakespeare, musical theatre, comedy, modern drama to vaudeville etc.

Anyway I feel that live theatre has huge relevance. I know this not only
from my standpoint, but from the view of some friends of mine who had never
been to a live performance until they had attended one of my shows.

Movies and tv may have all of the effects and glamour but there is nothing
like live theatre to suck you in. Having real, live breathing people in
front of you living the lives of wonderful characters can really give you a
charge. It's the ultimate in voyeurism. Real emotions can be seen and felt
(especially in some of the SRO, standing room only theatres I've worked in).
Of course the actors and directors have to be doing their job...sucky shows
can't do that for me though regardless of a show bombing or not I still have
that longing to be up there.

I think a lot of people don't go to theatre because they don't know about
it, or have never gone. Such was the case of several of my friends. It might
seem to be something uptight and they think they have to act a certain way
to see a show. Like it's a gala affair where you have to dress up. Sometimes
the show and what it makes them feel is threatening. TV can make you brain
dead but having three hours of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe being thrown
into your face and brain is anything but. One theatre newbie friend could
hardly talk to me after that show. He kept asking questions of me as if I
was the character, like he had trouble differentiating us. That show really
screwed with his head (as it did with the actors every night) as it should
have.

I would encourage anyone to see at least one show in their life. Community
theatre is where it's happening in my opinion where you can see normal every
day folks working very hard on their craft because they love it not because
they get a paycheck. These shows are usually pretty cheap to, cheaper than a
movie and popcorn now-a-days. It may just change your life.

Rant off :)

Any more questions Alida?

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Theatre, relevant or not?


I'm doing a survey for a class and wanted to know:
With the advent of other forms of entertainment such as film, video and
reality TV, is live theatre relevant? Why or why not?

*To add a little perspective:
-number of people that go to the theatre per year- 120 million
-number of people that go see top ten movies every year- 350 million +
another billion

When answering, please include your full name, age and occupation, and try
to
respond privately since this is NRR... unless all of you feel it is a
worthwhile topic to discuss. Thanks. : )

heart,
Alida

Disclaimer. I was told this TRUTH in Ibiza and the girl swears it's TRUE as the girl in question was her best mate and girls tell each other EVERYTHING, and if anyone says "but he has a girlfreind doesn't he?" then they surely don't understand the JETSET dj's. 
"Judge Jules is THE worst shag. And more when he took my mate into bed he couldn't perform at all. He likes, and usually always has to finish himself off as he can't manage it with a girl. He made her watch and she was too embarrased to leave, as she didn't want to totally destroy his ego, by denting it even a little. She did say tho' he was acting a little deflated.." 
Point 1  -  coked up dicks don't pleasure chicks 
Point 2 - how much does a person need to love/hate themselves that only they themselves are a turn on? 
Point 3 - They have more poor performances than they care too admit too.
keep it real Judge....

Exactly.

Moreover, this story fits the standard urban myth template of "person X told
me that person Y said blah and swears its true."  The story is never heard
directly from person Y (who supposedly actually had the first hand
experience) nor is there any supporting verifiable evidence.  Anytime you
hear a story in this form it is most likely not true but simply something
that sounds good and therefore gets repeated over and over.

Regards,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] scene death? what scene?

Very well Put Terry..

My Sentiments exactly..

As being someone that has been around for a long time and now almost NEVER 
goes out.. My personal feel is I don't really have a connection with the 
people that are going and throwing the parties these days. I guess it has to 
do with me not being 16 yr anymore?? and most of my Peers either don't do 
parties anymore Or are so few and far between that it just isn't enough to 
sustain that spark. Not that it is gone but there are very few parties in 
the UG community to look forward to.. I can recall a time when you would get 
excited that a Cloud Factory was going down in a cool lil warhouse or a 
Viberation was going down on Halloween so you would get excited with the 
thoughts of seeing old friends or wonder how they are going to top last 
years creative props etc.. These days at least what I see and keep in mind 
im sort of out of the whole "rave" loop, kinda focused more on trying to 
keep my job ;)
But it seems that the UG parties are geared more towards a younger crowd 
either by Music or apperance of flyers. One thing about the old crews and 
the "Early 90's" it wasn't really geared towards any specific market persay 
unless you had the blantant obvious jack ass promoters that geared there 
events towards E and other drugs.. But those were not a good majority.. I 
have alot of my old Gathering and FTT flyers and if you look at those it was 
geared more towards Reflection of ones self or spirituality or nature etc..

It wasn't bubble gum, thus it attracted a more mature type of crowd even if 
persons were young the climate was of a more mature one.

So I think that is what some of the younger party crews and attendies need 
to get back to.. Sort of like what terry was saying more family based etc..

6x9s so my road trip music will get the volume it deserves...having packed a
first aid kit, a set of tools, a bag of Cheetos and an extra hat...

ready, willing, and able to rise again from the ashes of my former life,

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Next up: Harry Blotter Acid?

Wow, no mention of raves.. That's rare ;)  But on the other hand... If
they have documented selling them to 12 year olds... God, that's just
messed up.  Although I highly disagree with them being stamped to target
children.  If the main video game market is 18 - 27 year olds now, that
should throw out the old notion that all games are for kids, and I've
only met 4 kids that read Harry Potter.. My nieces and nephews.
Everyone else I've met who's read them are adults.. And its hard to find
one in any walk of life that hasn't read them, I've almost given in and
picked one up ;)  The books, not the pills. :)

As cool as that little rant was, I did not write it.  Based on what I know
of the author and the list it came from, (I'm not a subscriber) I'd say it

I'm starting off the houseparty circuit with an SFR party at the house. =
I'm trying to get people that you've never met and I've never met under =
one roof for some simple fun. I think it's time to expand our circles =
and see each other again. That means whatever you're doing you need to =
be at my house sometime on Friday night. We'll be going all night, but =
kicking the level of sound down a bit in the later hours. Open decks and =
we have a 2x4 setup in the dining room now. Bring whatever you want. =
Movies, booze, food, party favors, whatever you want. I just want to see =
everyone come out and play!

I'm thinking about going with themed rooms, but not sure yet. If you =
were to go to a house party what would you want? It's going to be cozy =
and I'm sure memorable. Bring a friend that you normally don't party =
with. I just want to see everyone again and have fun.

Don't forget pj's and comfy stuff. Like I said we're going all night. I =
think I'll name one of the rooms The Den of Sin in honor of Scott.

Ooops.. Sorry about the last one.. The "Send" button on this thing is far
too close to where I was pruning extraneous email addresses.  :(

Anyway, I think that stuff is good in small doses - I like dry humor a lot,
but I think Strongbad, etc. is more on the moist side.  (Sorry, just a
shitty metaphor.)

On the other hand, I found that inspiring, and I'm going to have to talk to
my admin about putting in Flash 404 messages on our server. Wow, how much
would it totally suck to get a 404 *and* the little puzzle piece telling you
you don't have the latest plug-in?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] all your fault...darn you!!

Little fluffy clouds? ;)

I've noticed this too.  I came out here from Utah where I was into every
form of art.. After coming out here my inspiration is next to nil.
Can't make a beat to save a train.  Its just too.... Comfortable out
here... The sun is yellower, the weather's better, the people are
friendly and open-minded, everything that fed me the agression in Utah,
I no longer feel here, nothing to inspire me.  Plus, the work and hours
you have to put in just to make rent (albeit I do live a little too
comfortably) just wears you down to the point where you don't care about
going out anymore.

My plan to reverse this is to leave corporate america behind and I'm
moving to Santa Cruz to go to college since I haven't done that yet.

I'd say I'm one, but then I see you qualified the question with "good"  ;)

Actually, that might be a good weekend project - to come up with one that
anyone can use as their 404, then put it up for grabs Hmmm...

Right now I'm thinking of a big picture of Hilary Rosen with an iPod with
text: "This page has been removed by the request of the RIAA."  But, uh,
that's not Flash, is it? d'OH!

This is funny on sooo many levels. Of course the reporters found the most
ghetto ass pair of people to interview. Kinda like interviewing a 14 yr old
KaNdEe KiD about raves. Now, I grew up in East Oakland, so I have strong
ghetto roots, but I am constantly puzzled by the things that hood rats do.
Like, putting $500 rims on a beatup El Camino and thinking you're pimping.
WTF?!?

The remix, on the other hand, is dope! I give props to whoever put that out,
and will def make sure that it gets added to the Final Scratch library!  :-)
woo WOO!!!

I dunno- my first exposure was to this:

Some years ago...

I thought the retarded-sounding voice was kinda funny, but... all the
cartoons suck (to put it bluntly)
I guess it's just not my style of comedy-

I think the best part is when homeboy goes flying out of the garage, swerves
into the street, swerves around the car in the oncoming lane of traffic he's
driving in, and then BLOWS the stop sign. All while the reporter says
*...was more than willing to show it off for us...*

I finally know why this guys car in my neighborhood sounds like shit. I
thought he had a vaccum leak. It seriously sounds like something is *wrong*
with the car and not something *cool*

I don't get this anymore than the Geo Metros in Atlanta with the 18's and
20's on them. Yes, people really do that. Ghetto trends are, well, ghetto...

Dj Flippy from the Mid-West sent it to me, i am not sure if he made it, but
i wouldnt be surprised since he does produce both Ambient and Happycore...
(i know, ambient and happycore, what a mix of genres)

Victory for Racine Rave-Goers
Fri Jan 17, 2003


The City of Racine agreed to drop all charges against 442 people who were 
ticketed at a benefit electronic music concert simply for being in 
proximity to a drug arrest on the premises. The decision marks a 
significant victory for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who 
argued that Racine authorities violated the constitutional rights of the 
partygoers.

"The ACLU urges the City of Racine to respect the First Amendment rights of 
electronic music attendees in the future," said Micabil Diaz, Legal 
Director of the ACLU of Wisconsin. "We also applaud the hundreds of 
attendees who defended their constitutional rights".

Last November, police raided an electronic music concert held by the Uptown 
Theater Group, Inc. raising funds for restorations to an historic landmark 
theater in downtown Racine, Wisconsin. Four people at the party were 
arrested on drug charges. The police department claimed that the mere 
presence of the 442 concertgoers at a location in which four persons were 
arrested on drug charges violated the city's "inmates of a disorderly 
house" ordinance.

The citations were challenged on the basis that the ordinance violated the 
First Amendment right to freedom of association since it was imposed on 
individuals whose only actions were peaceably assembling to hear electronic 
music. In dismissing the charges, the city acknowledged that the law needs 
to be changed.

With the reintroduction in Congress of an anti-Rave bill that targets music 
promoters, the ACLU, along with Drug Policy Alliance, fear that this will 
not be the last unconstitutional attempt at prosecution of innocent people. 
The Drug Policy Alliance is spearheading a legislative campaign to prevent 
this harm maximization bill from passing. By targeting individual property 
owners or event attendees the bill will only drive raves and other musical 
events further underground and away from public health and safety regulations.

George Sand wrote:  "One changes from day to day...every few years one 
becomes a new being."  I think that can be said of the consistent human 
interest and involvement in the timeless and magical art and practice of 
tribal dance and music.   Dancing was there in the beginning;  it will be a 
vital part of social and spiritual interaction until the end of time.   It 
constantly reinvents itself to accommodate various cultural and social 
requirements.

Raving in the early nineties was one of many attempts in our 
post-industrial society to wed these ancient, life-giving rites to 
technology and the needs of the modern psyche.  There were those of us who 
believed in those days that we were creating a revolutionary approach to 
human interaction in an increasingly alienating and homogeneous social 
structure.  Some even thought that we had rediscovered an ancient 
connection to the spiritual life.  Certainly early house music lyrics were 
packed with allusions to the movement of the dancer from and through the 
body to the heavens.

This was not boring.  Boredom sets in within life -- and god I know this is 
true -- when you embrace, out of fatigue or social pressure, the rule of 
the mundane and quantifiable.  At some point in the mid-nineties -- and I 
can't put my finger on this because I was to busy with death and dying from 
AIDS in my personal life then -- raving moved from revolution to 
entertainment.  I suspect much of this had to do with the changing 
economics and demographics of the time, and I have yet to work through this 
process to my satisfaction.

So we gradually lost the feel of movement and moved in the direction of yet 
another commodified entertainment package.  We lost content.  Our beliefs 
were reduced to catchy slogans.  In the sixties we called this being co opted.

Now when a movement embraces the mundane those involved generally become 
more acceptable to the society at large.  When gays moved from "we are 
unique and have something special to offer" to "we are just like you" the 
road to general acceptance was much facilitated.  We lost our souls, I 
think, but we gained respect as another valuable consumer market.

Interestingly, this has not happened with raving or, if you will, dance and 
music festivals or "parties."  Lordy knows there was a lot of money in 
massives, clothing sales, and the like.  A "youth" marketer's dream.  Yet 
the more we emerged into the light, the less acceptable we became.  One 
could say, and we all did, "look at the rock concerts, look at other forms 
of entertainment -- we are no worse, even less dangerous in many ways.  We 
are Americans like you making money on entertainment and being 
entertained."  Didn't work.

Why?  Because whatever one wants to position raving as, dancing all night 
long is really a revolutionary act.  Ponder this.

It doesn't matter to me personally whether one considers this "movement" 
dead or not.  Any movement without beliefs and passion is moribund, and 
perhaps that is what raving has become.

I will, however, continue to follow my own passions here.  I will dance 
until I can no longer walk.  I will continue to throw parties based in the 
belief that dancing is a powerful, liberating and magical force that has 
the potential to change lives and enhance the larger society for the 
good.  What we do can be defined as one will.  The music will change and 
evolve.  The parties may become more wedded to other arts along with the 
music.  The guests may become more inclusive and diverse.  But we are not 
going away.  Dancing as a revolutionary, life-giving act will withstand 
this current oppression as it has before.  Fashions change, but this one 
has and will last longer than fifteen minutes.

Love,

Apollo

FYI We get 75%of our oil from South america, and area's that are NOT the 
middle east.....so if we just increase efficiancy or limit the amount of oil 
we consume by 25% the "problem" would cease to exist, this whole war is a 
tactic for the Bush administration to gain control over the oil supply for 
EUROPE...WHAT THE HELL!!!

Here's an interesting thought....it wasn't that much about oil the first
time (Gulf War)
and it's even less about it this time.  Is that so hard to accept?

Subject: [sfraves] NRR)Memoirs of a San Franciscan Vol.1


Last night was incredible. I hope you can tell through the intonation of 
this email note.
Out in front of a club, yes it was a "gay" one, a tall, drunk, lanky man 
sought out my subconscious healing abilities.  A new friend named Sam stood 
to my left and observed carefully the interaction between the drunkard and 
I....

"Wuddup bro?" as the man stumbled to and fro, "Do you ever listen to God?  
Do you have any pot? I mean do you ever see what is going on?"  he pauses to 
hock a loogie..."there is so much going on that is bad!  Do you understand?"
   "Oh yeah I understand, that is probably the only reason that I'm still 
here listenning to what you are saying" I replied as my eyeballs were 
drifting at the hideous drag queen that just passed.  Sam was laughing in 
his head.
   I was saddenned yet amused that this tall drunk guy was speaking such 
verbal nonsense in the Castro, yet found it "comforting."
   He threw his giant hand on my shoulder for support...
   "Do you feel the gravity pulling on me?  It is so heavy."  He said.  He 
looked down toward the ground in a state of surreal amusement.
   "Believe it or not I CAN actually feel the gravity that is pulling you 
down cause it actually is affecting  myself as well"  I said.
Sam laughed.
  "I'm Malcovich, sorry I didn't introduce myself."
  "as  in 'Being John?' or just Malcovich,?"
  "Nah, just Malcovich" he said.
   "I'm Danny and this is my friend Sam, nice meeting you."
   "I just got my girlfriend pregnant...It's a Boy!!!!!"  Malcovich was so 
excited he stumbled right to the top of some queen's brand new BMW then fell 
to the ground...
I was trying to figure out what his sign was the whole time...Aries? maybe 
rising? Virgo? nah not too hard on himself, maybe aquarius?  Yes  
Aquarius!!!  My mind was happy because I new that was it.  He continued to 
lean against the car with his eyes trying to catch up with his spinning 
head...
   "Malcovich, are you an aquarius?"
He looked at me as if I were the great and powerful Wizard of OZ, his eyes 
were huge and looked right into mine...
  "Yes."  He didn't ask how I knew, because he knew how I knew in the simple 
statement that I had made earlier "I UNDERSTAND."
  "There are so many worlds, so many life patterns, energy, people..."
My hunch was that homeboy was a bit overwhelmed in the aquarian head of his.
  "Malcovich"
  "Yeah?"
  "Be good to yourself, there are other people out there who understand, 
really there are.  They are all just hiding in drag."  Sam had to turn away 
to not show Malcovich his roaring laughter.  "There are lots of people..."
   "You're name is Robert right?  He interrupted.
   "No, it's Danny"
   "Robert, you know I always forget names, but I remember your's for some 
reason, I don't know why.  Do you have any pot?"


So that was my San franciscan evenning last night.  Who knows what will be 
in store for the next?  I hope Malcovich finds his way, and I hope we all 
find our way as well, whatever the case maybe just know if you are ever 
impregnating somebody and are highly sensitive and drunk in search of 
marijuana, there mostlikley will be somebody you can lean on in the 
Castro...
Until next time, farewell and be good!
Danny Picard

  I don't get this anymore than the Geo Metros in Atlanta with the 18's =

  This is funny on sooo many levels. Of course the reporters found the =

  Like, putting $500 rims on a beatup El Camino and thinking you're =

IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NEEDED :
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL

FROM: GEORGE WALKER BUSH
202.456.1414 / 202.456.1111
FAX: 202.456.2461

DEAR SIR / MADAM,

I AM GEORGE WALKER BUSH, SON OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH, AND CURRENTLY SERVING AS
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THIS LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE
YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT MET NEITHER IN PERSON NOR BY CORRESPONDENCE. I
CAME TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE PERSON TO
HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS TRANSACTION, WHICH INVOLVES THE
TRANSFER OF A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO AN ACCOUNT REQUIRING MAXIMUM
CONFIDENCE.

I AM WRITING YOU IN ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE PRIMARILY TO SEEK YOUR
ASSISTANCE IN ACQUIRING OIL FUNDS THAT ARE PRESENTLY TRAPPED IN THE
REPUBLIC OF IRAQ.  MY PARTNERS AND I SOLICIT YOUR ASSISTANCE IN
COMPLETING A TRANSACTION BEGUN BY MY FATHER, WHO HAS LONG BEEN ACTIVELY
ENGAGED IN THE EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
AND BRAVELY SERVED HIS COUNTRY AS DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED STATES CENTRAL
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA).

IN THE DECADE OF THE NINETEEN-EIGHTIES, MY FATHER, THEN VICE-PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SOUGHT TO WORK WITH THE GOOD OFFICES OF
THE RESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ TO REGAIN LOST OIL REVENUE SOURCES
IN THE NEIGHBORING ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN. THIS UNSUCCESSFUL VENTURE
WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY A FALLING-OUT WITH HIS IRAQI PARTNER, WHO SOUGHT TO
ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUE SOURCES IN THE NEIGHBORING EMIRATE OF
KUWAIT, A WHOLLY-OWNED U.S.-BRITISH SUBSIDIARY.

MY FATHER RE-SECURED THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF KUWAIT IN 1991 AT A COST OF
SIXTY-ONE BILLION U.S. DOLLARS ($61,000,000,000). OUT OF THAT COST,
THIRTY-SIX BILLION DOLLARS ($36,000,000,000) WERE SUPPLIED BY HIS
PARTNERS IN THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER PERSIAN GULF
MONARCHIES, AND SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ($16,000,000,000) BY GERMAN AND
JAPANESE PARTNERS. BUT MY FATHER'S FORMER IRAQI BUSINESS PARTNER
REMAINED IN CONTROL OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ITS PETROLEUM RESERVES.

MY FAMILY IS CALLING FOR YOUR URGENT ASSISTANCE IN FUNDING THE REMOVAL
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ACQUIRING THE PETROLEUM
ASSETS OF HIS COUNTRY, AS COMPENSATION FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVING HIM
FROM POWER. UNFORTUNATELY, OUR PARTNERS FROM 1991 ARE NOT WILLING TO
SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF THIS NEW VENTURE, WHICH IN ITS UPCOMING PHASE MAY
COST THE SUM OF 100 BILLION TO 200 BILLION DOLLARS ($100,000,000,000 -
$200,000,000,000), BOTH IN THE INITIAL ACQUISITION AND IN LONG-TERM
MANAGEMENT.

WITHOUT THE FUNDS FROM OUR 1991 PARTNERS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO
ACQUIRE THE OIL REVENUE TRAPPED WITHIN IRAQ. THAT IS WHY MY FAMILY AND
OUR COLLEAGUES ARE URGENTLY SEEKING YOUR GRACIOUS ASSISTANCE. OUR
DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES IN THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION INCLUDE THE
SITTING VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RICHARD CHENEY,
WHO IS AN ORIGINAL PARTNER IN THE IRAQ VENTURE AND FORMER HEAD OF THE
HALLIBURTON OIL COMPANY, AND CONDOLEEZA RICE, WHOSE PROFESSIONAL
DEDICATION TO THE VENTURE WAS DEMONSTRATED IN THE NAMING OF A CHEVRON
OIL TANKER AFTER HER.

I WOULD BESEECH YOU TO TRANSFER A SUM EQUALING TEN TO TWENTY-FIVE
PERCENT (10-25 %) OF YOUR YEARLY INCOME TO OUR ACCOUNT TO AID IN THIS
IMPORTANT VENTURE. THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA WILL FUNCTION AS OUR TRUSTED INTERMEDIARY. I PROPOSE THAT YOU
MAKE THIS TRANSFER BEFORE THE FIFTEENTH (15TH) OF THE MONTH OF APRIL.

I KNOW THAT A TRANSACTION OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD MAKE ANYONE
APPREHENSIVE AND WORRIED. BUT I AM ASSURING YOU THAT ALL WILL BE WELL AT
THE END OF THE DAY. A BOLD STEP TAKEN SHALL NOT BE REGRETTED, I ASSURE
YOU. PLEASE DO BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL.
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO CO-OPERATE IN THIS TRANSACTION, PLEASE CONTACT OUR
INTERMEDIARY REPRESENTATIVES TO FURTHER DISCUSS THE MATTER.

I PRAY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PLIGHT. MY FAMILY AND OUR COLLEAGUES WILL
BE FOREVER GRATEFUL. PLEASE REPLY IN STRICT CONFIDENCE TO THE CONTACT
NUMBERS BELOW.

SINCERELY WITH WARM REGARDS,

GEORGE WALKER BUSH

You think you got me in a corner now, huh - ive been saving this card
all game, sucka. First I tap four e-puddles and send my '6am crackhead'
into battle. Your onslaught of invalid rave ticket defense is no match
for his blinding force. Next I tap another 2 e-puddles and unveil my
"overflowing urinal" as a pure defense measure. As you attack my
promoter of endor I lay down the 'instant' "no toilet paper" on
overflowing urinal inflicting +4 damage.=20

Nothing can stop me now!

I thought the IRS did have an e-payment option.  (Haven't used it
though.)

I've thought that a great anti-war protest would be 100s of 1000s of
people not paying their taxes this year.  Only problem is, you've
already payed much, if not more, of your taxes via deductions.  So
not filing won't really get you anywhere.  (If it weren't for that
LITTLE detail, would have been a great plan.)

The best alternative I've come up with for attacking war funding is
moving your money out of the banks and into credit unions.  They're
non-profit, and I believe primarily focus their energies on giving back
to the community.  There's an online credit union locator here:
http://www.cuna.org/data/consumer/culinks/cu_locator.html

Personally, I've been with Wells Fargo for years, mainly out of laziness
in making an effort to make a move.  With all that's going on
politically, I'm getting out of there and moving my accounts to a credit
union.

OB rave related content:  I'd assume it's primarily via banks that the
funding for cracking down on our activities cones from. Why should I
support that?

Doesn't the EU get the whopping majority of the current output from
Iraq?  It'd seem the reality is that the war is about us getting a
greater share of that output.  Right?

without any proof?  Yeah, that's a little hard to swallow, since we have 
proof otherwise.  ie Kuwait was slant drilling into Iraqi oil fields.

Yup, it adds up.  According to the data you present Mr W, we get about 77% 
of our oil from non-Arab OPEC and non OPEC contributors.

Another great event that you might want to look into is LANSURGE. The events are pretty much monthly and about 70-100 people are attending right now with all-out network battles. Check out www.lansurge.com 
Myself (Sascha23) and several other DJs from XTORT and Subsonic Underground go to play games and DJ as well.

How exactly is war with Iraw going to get us a greater share of the
output?  Yknow what cracks me the hell up, this "blood for oil" b.s.
Was there some kind of oil crisis in 1991?  I think not.  Was there one
about 6 months ago?  I think not.  Are there other middle eastern
countries capable of pumping as much oil as Iraq?  I think so.  Are
we going to war (or have we in modern times) with any of them?
No, I think not.  Do those said countries also wish Saddam was out
of power?  I think so.  Blood for oil my ass!  As long as we don't
go guns a blazin' and have *proof* of womd then it's all good.

I'm sure.  And without any appeal to the UN or others it's just a o k
for Iraq to invade, take over, rape, kill, etc.?  Guess so eh?  By the
way, what was Iraq's reason for trying to take over Iran?  And i'm sure
Saddam had a good reason for poisoning the Kurds, right?  Right.

The total amount of oil reserves is a known quantity, and it's 
shrinking.  Why does it have to run out before it's a crisis?

For the same duration?  I doubt it.

Subject: [sfraves] Goodbye SF & SFRavers!!

Dear SFRavers,

It was very nice getting to know a very small percentage of you that I 
have actually met in person. My time has come to depart from the United 
States in exploration of what is outside of my sheltered American 
lifestyle. The end of February I am moving to Bangkok, Thailand to 
reside 'permanently' and continue my studies in school. But I am 
unsubscribing for now until sometime in the future if my fate is 
somehow again intertwined with the Bay Area's. :)


It is always fun partying with you all and the one thing I think I'll 
miss the most is the great music that is here and the great people too. 
Hopefully, when I return at some point in the future, techno will rule 
the dance music scene and everyone will submit to it's supremacy :)

unity,
Chris

You miss the point.  Why do we need a greater share of the output when Iraq
(sanctions or no) isn't that much of our input?  And I wasn't aware this was
the 80's (re: Taliban, re: Nicaragua)

It isn't a known quantity, though it is shrinking.  A crisis doesn't
occure just because it's running out.  It wont run out for decades.
Hence, why pick on one country who's output, while significant, isn't
that much in the scheme of things, decades before a crisis caused by
oil actually is on the verge of running out?  Makes no sense, think
about it.

Hahahah, and so cound most European powers.  It's essentially one of
those cases where everyone knows we'll do it, so they let us.  Why
does Canada have such fabulous social services?  Oh yeah, a very low
defense budget.  Why?  Same thing.

Yeah, us and every other industrialized country, plus a few lesser
countries lol.  If I recall N.Korea just recently shipped some weapons
to Iraq.  No wait, there was no flag on that ship!    Falst alarm!

he's

Subject: [sfraves] americans and their dreams of oil v.s. what's really going on nrr

i realize that a great number of americans have cars,
and with that comes the fear of an increase in oil
prices until other better and more efficient energies
and cars are more readily available (sooner than you
think, folks, but hey, we are a country of obesity,
most of which is derived from what is a culturally
learned and mostly impulsive nature reflected in the
fact that many americans spend a lot  of time, energy
and money eating as much fast food as one can fit into
a day)...if someone is american and anti-war, a
popular argument for the impending war on iraq is that
this must really have something to do with the oil,
which isn't ours, by the way....if your in cali, your
into produce and your plastic surgeon.....if your
typically american, however, and concerned with the
oil, then you believe that the impending war has
something to do with the fact that we ALL know how
important the oil is....in the first place, not
everyone is freak'in over the oil, and secondly, i
don't know if anyone's actually been paying attention
to world politics or if their just into camping out
for a day in the big cities of their dreams, leaving
trash all around, starting fights, barking at the
otherwise mostly law abiding and generally always
peaceful locals, but there's just a little problem in
the eyes of most that the leadership over in iraq have
made it most difficult for representatives from all
around the globe, otherwise known as the U.N., to do
their peace keeping job and perform a thorough
inspection of the weaponry over in iraq....do your
suppose they are  hiding nuclear capabilities? most
likely, yes...this impending war has very little to do
with your cars, people...just leave them in the
garage. most everyone, including your president, would
prefer a peaceful resolution. :)

http://dieoff.com/page133.htm includes stats from the BP Statistical
Review of World Energy (1961-1998) which shows the world production of
oil was 26.5 Billion gallons in '97.  Of that, Iraq produced 0.44
Billion gallons in '97.  (This equals ~ 1.67% of the overall production
that year.)  Browsing the site AndyW pointed out, you can find the
'97 data.  In '97 the US imported 3,708,970,000 barrels of total crude
oil & product in Nov. '02. of which 32,530,000 came from Iraq.  That
shows Iraq accounted for 0.877% of our overall imports.  So, in '97 Iraq
accounted for 0.877% of our overall imports, but 1.67% of the overall
production.

Note:  I use '97 because the first site I refer to above only had data
from '97.

My late (again) and too verbose (sorry) input:

The Gulf War was not too hard to justify, at least on the surface. The US was again playing international policeman, protecting Kuwait from the invading larger country, Iraq. I can accept that. There was a reason we did not take over Iraq in full  there was no solid moral argument for doing so. And it would have been against international law. Its called national sovereignty. The same exact reason we had the right to kick Iraq out of Kuwait by force.

Now the official US goal is to "disarm" the tyrant Saddam, because he "could" one day use those weapons against us. This is a very morally weak position, that in my view (and quite a lot of others, if you listen for opinions from somewhere other than corporate controlled media) could lead to a very scary world order. The fact is, our government is being very subjective, selective, and unbalanced in their approach. That is why so many countries are politely saying, wait a minute, what the fuck do you think you are doing?

If the same criteria for a "preemptive strike" were used to analyze a dozen other counties around the world, we should be going to war with ALL of them. Are you comfortable with your country, which represents you to the rest of humanity, doing this? Since we are the biggest kid on the block, do we have the "right" to force everyone else to be and do what is in OUR best interest, fuck the rest of em?

Saddam is a sick fuck-of-a-ruler who oppresses his own people.

I think Bush is a sick fuck who does not represent his own people. His press secretary made the statement yesterday: even if the majority of the American people stated they do not want the US to invade Iraq, he would still move forward because HE fills it is the correct thing to do. I heard this on NPR radio. Please check me for accuracy. 

But regardless, my point would be, which other country has the right to come in and kick out Bush because they feel he is evil/bad/unwanted? No one. So why do we have that right to do the same thing to Iraq? What makes it morally justified? Where does this all end, except with a lot of graves. Iraqi, American, and otherwise.

Pedro.

I'm sure. And without any appeal to the UN or others it's just a o k

for Iraq to invade, take over, rape, kill, etc.? Guess so eh? By the

way, what was Iraq's reason for trying to take over Iran? And i'm sure

Saddam had a good reason for poisoning the Kurds, right? Right.

It doesn't matter if Iraq only produces one barrel of oil a day. Afghanista=
n
produces diddly squat (to use a technical term) of the world's oil output,
yet we had to "free" them in the War Against Terror=81 so we can have
friendlies in there to get our oil pipeline through central Asia.

By the same reasoning, it's only to the greater overall benefit to take ove=
r
resources in Iraq. It may be a small piece of the pie, but because Iraq is
centrally located in the Middle East, it stands as a great gateway for the
transport of oil. Much of the Iran/Iraq war was rooted in a territorial
dispute over the tiny Shatt al Arab waterway, which is essential for
transporting oil out of the region (which includes the former Soviet
republics around the Caspian) and into the Gulf by ship.

If you're looking at Iraq's relatively small oil output, you're not seeing
the forest for the proverbial trees.  Keep in mind that oil isn't the only
resource at hand here. While it's not an issue in the present, the region
(particularly Iran) is sitting on top of another goldmine of fossil fuel:
natural gas, which when the oil runs out could be the commodity of the
future.

Another IF... If you think that this is about Saddam Hussein's record of
civil rights, the fact that he's a dictator, the fact that he kills off
Kurds and Shiites, you're wrong. WE gave chemical and biological weapons to
Iraq during their war with Iran, fully aware of what type of leader Saddam
Hussein was. Why did we ally with Hussein to fight Iran? It wasn't because
of any student revolt at the embassy, the hostages, etc.  Well before the
Islamic revolution took place (that's when they stormed the American embass=
y
in Tehran and ceased diplomatic relations), and long before they had a
dictatorial king, the Iranian government decided to nationalize their
business in... Dum dum dum.. OIL.  Meaning that foreign companies no longer
had any control of oil production in the country. So when the Iran-Iraq war
started, many countries, including ours, sided with Iraq, in hopes of
defeating Iran and regaining the oil interests there. Just as with Iraq,
Iran doesn't represent a huge portion of the world's oil production, but
because it has half of the Caspian region (and at the other time, the other
half was in the Soviet Union) it was a key gateway to all of Central Asia.

So please - look beyond the surface, and even go beyond the secondary layer
of facts. Look at every level, and look at the big picture, before you make
a simple-minded statement like "this war isn't about oil since Iraq doesn't
produce very much" or "this war is about freeing people from the hands of a=
n
evil dictator."

When the president, vice president, and national security adviser all cut
their teeth in the oil industry, perhaps quite difficult to accept. Were
you aware that condi rice has a tanker named after her? How much more
clearly does it need to be spelled out? Everyone laughs at how obviously
greedy and manipulative Mr. Burns is on the Simpsons, yet when it happens
in the real world it's a cause for debate.

Also, if anyone is looking for colocation and managed hosting, please

might I suggest you defend against this by using your 'mop of 
enlightenment', and 'midnight safeway run'. burying the '6am crackhead' 
with the instant 'safety crew' might be a good idea too. I dunno, maybe 
if you're feeling lucky, you can use the "bong of truth" and reflect all 
  damage next turn.

it is just a silly coincidence.

Raving in the early nineties was one of many attempts in our=20

believed in those days that we were creating a revolutionary approach =

human interaction in an increasingly alienating and homogeneous social=20
structure.  Some even thought that we had rediscovered an ancient=20
connection to the spiritual life.  Certainly early house music lyrics =

packed with allusions to the movement of the dancer from and through =

body to the heavens.

This was not boring.  Boredom sets in within life -- and god I know this =

true -- when you embrace, out of fatigue or social pressure, the rule =

the mundane and quantifiable.  At some point in the mid-nineties -- and =

entertainment.  I suspect much of this had to do with the changing=20
economics and demographics of the time, and I have yet to work through =
this=20
process to my satisfaction.

So we gradually lost the feel of movement and moved in the direction of =
yet=20
another commodified entertainment package.  We lost content.  Our =
beliefs=20
were reduced to catchy slogans.  In the sixties we called this being co =

Now when a movement embraces the mundane those involved generally =
become=20
more acceptable to the society at large.  When gays moved from "we are=20
unique and have something special to offer" to "we are just like you" =
the=20
road to general acceptance was much facilitated.  We lost our souls, I=20
think, but we gained respect as another valuable consumer market.

Interestingly, this has not happened with raving or, if you will, dance =

music festivals or "parties."  Lordy knows there was a lot of money in=20

the more we emerged into the light, the less acceptable we became.  One=20
could say, and we all did, "look at the rock concerts, look at other =
forms=20
of entertainment -- we are no worse, even less dangerous in many ways.  =
We=20
are Americans like you making money on entertainment and being=20
entertained."  Didn't work.

Why?  Because whatever one wants to position raving as, dancing all =
night=20
long is really a revolutionary act.  Ponder this.

It doesn't matter to me personally whether one considers this "movement"=20=

dead or not.  Any movement without beliefs and passion is moribund, and=20
perhaps that is what raving has become.

I will, however, continue to follow my own passions here.  I will dance=20

On another note, another bay area clan server for Counter Strike is The
Scorpions Nest.   http://www.clantsn.com and our server is
bsd.clantsn.com.  Pretty fast server, used to be really busy all the
time but I'm not sure about it recently.. I've been working on other
things or when I do play, play Natural Selection.

On that note, I have an Quake 3: urban terror server set up at 
hive.antitux.net:27960. Please feel free to use it as you want :) Also,
if anyone is looking for colocation and managed hosting, please 
ping me. I'm looking to sell more rackspace (I've got about 8U to sell 
off). I'm hosted at he.net, on obscene bandwidth.

if you can believe it, I sold a Danny Tenaglia remix of that for ten bucks
last year on eBay - now I have some awesome dark tech-house on the flip of
one of my favorite breaks tracks, and I've got nothing to mix it with except
for three different remixes of the same damn Orbital song...duh...

similar experience on my end...I lived way too comfortably when I was in
CA...and every creative endeavor I made was less effective than similar
projects from my pre-CA life...I lived in Chicago and made pretty good
tracks on a Korg M1...then I moved to California and added an MPC, a
Prophecy, a Nord Lead, and like ten other gadgets...and I sounded like
shit...

my college experience was an interesting year...reading Aristotle in the

"The State Department is sending a cable to embassies around the world
telling Americans abroad to be ready to leave their resident country
quickly in an emergency, State Department officials said on Friday."

Good thinking - my Polish passport is up-to-date, and I'm ready to leave
my resident country quickly.

>>> Terry Estioko <terry@hyperreal.org> 01/23/03 12:47AM >>>
I'm gonna try to weigh in on the whole thread, because so many great ideas
have been posted. I wrote this kinda fast, and tried to be brief, so =
apologies
on grammar or lack in clarity:

On scene death...
I've always thought it interesting as our scene came to rise and decline,
because (imho) the driving force of the undergrounds stayed
constant. I was in the interesting position to associate myself w/ the UG
crews, but kept tabs on the big scene by continually being booked for
massives. It got more and more ridiculous as mainstream parties broke out,
almost like the dotcoms. But just as the dotcoms have been forced to adapt
or die, mainstream parties are forced to do the same. At the same time,
the void left by UG veteran crews, who have either retreated to
their own circles or declined out of age, has not been filled...as of yet.

On fads....
I never really thought a lot of the people going to raves in the late 90's
knew enough about it to appreciate it. It was a fad. Some of us would like
to believe the rave scene is more of a movement...but is it? Surely some
of us have experienced life-changing transformations, but is our
philosophy and culture enough to be timeless? What makes us any more of a
movement than breakdancing, any less than hippies?

On subjectivity....
One thing I learned in my time with you all is that the more I
learn, I less I realize I know. Kinda like how you think you have it *all
figured out* by the time you're 18, but 10 years later you realize you
knew very little. This scene lives by the quality of its subjective
experience. The magic that I felt at a certain time in my life was not
absolute, and later on in my involvement here I found the same enjoyment
seeing others experience the same magic. So there really is no timetable,
it's what we make of it, and what we decide to share with others.

On my own involvement...
I feel like a schmuck for not contributing as much recently as I probably
could. We threw a bunch of really good parties several years ago, but now
they're probably a distant memory. The concept behind our parties really
never caught on, perhaps partially because we never threw-for-profit, and =
only
struck when the iron was hot and our conditions met, but we learned a lot.
I sucessfully dealt with the authorites on lots of occasions. I know how
to *not* blow a circuit. I know how to set up a party that won't fall down
at 1am. These days, I'm more concerned about keeping a roof over my head
than entertaining a bunch of folks.
It seems though, that lots of the same general party throwing questions =
come
up here. I noticed Yarrow came out candid on this list, which I normally
wouldn't expect from a massive promoter.I guess I'm saying that I still =
think
more resources are on this list than some would expect. I'm glad this =
dialogue
is taking place, and hope we continue to talk about it.

On elitism...
I believe this was brought about through necessity, not egomania. There
was a time, as some would remember, when Friends and Family planned
parties on this list. Eventually the list just became too big for them,
And soon after, became too dangerous to post any UG events here. Those
groups who have left the spotlight never needed to come back. It just
became way easier to *not* have an open-door to the rave community. And at =
this
point, I don't think any of them are coming back, which leads me to...

On reinvention....
All the ideas posted on this thread are golden. Far different than a few
years ago when the general scene mentality was "gimme gimme gimme". To
question your involvement in a scene/fad/movement and reevaluate that =
scene
shows that we are ready for the next step. What is the next step? I have =
no
idea what floats all your people's boat. Personally, I'd like to see some =
well
produced, family-oriented, safe, truly-innovative, from-the-heart parties
(whatever that means). I remember being a "scenester" in '96 and having my
rave world turned upside down by FnF $5 parties with full on
*everything*, that was legendary shit. I'd like to see new crews/families
emerge with the knowledge of their predecessors and make it better. It's =
clear
to me there are still a lot of great people in the scene, many veterans =
have
been scorched and are apprehensive, many others have fresh ideas to bring
to the table. Ultimately, it's up to our collective force to decide where =
we
go from here.

Thanks for listening, I almost feel like there was a point to everything I
said that never came out. Oh well, maybe it did, maybe it'll come out
later.

take care,

-terry

As you know, some of us on this list are organizing representation for the 
next march for peace.

This march and rally has been rescheduled for Sunday, February 16th, so as 
not to conflict with the Chinese New Year celebration on the 15th.

Those interested in working with Ravers for Peace should contact me off list.

*Mass March to Stop War On Iraq Sunday February 16 in San Francisco*


The next mass march in San Francisco to stop war on Iraq has been
rescheduled from Saturday, February 15 to Sunday, February 16, to avoid
conflicting with the Chinese New Year Day Parade.


The anti-war march gathers on Sunday February 16 at 11 AM at Embarcadero
Plaza and will march at 1 PM to a 2 PM rally at Civic Center Plaza. The
February 16 demonstration is being co-sponsored by Bay United Against War,
The Not in Our Name Project, United for Peace and Justice, and The Int'l
ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) Coalition and is endorsed by
thousands of organizations and individuals.


At a heavily attended press conference today at City Hall in San Francisco,
elected officials, labor, community and anti-war leaders called on people
to participate in the San Francisco Chinese New Year Parade on Saturday
February 15th as well as the Mass Anti-War March in San Francisco the
following day, Sunday February 16. Among those who spoke at the press
conference and encouraged participation in both events were Mayor Willie
Brown, Supervisor Tom Ammiano, Supervisor Fiona Ma, Supervisor Aaron
Peskin, a representative of the Chinese New Year Day Parade, Howard Wallace
of the San Francisco Labor Council, Andrea Buffa of United for Peace and
Justice, Bonnie Weinstein of Bay Area United Against War, and Richard
Becker of the Int'l ANSWER Coalition.

Subject: [sfraves] scene death?  what scene? (OK eveyone please read this, I typed it) free admission to Stamina


In a message dated 1/22/03 9:48:50 PM, terry@hyperreal.org writes:

<< I noticed Yarrow came out candid on this list, which I normally
wouldn't expect from a massive promoter.I guess I'm saying that I still think
more resources are on this list than some would expect. >>

 You can count on me to be candid, always. And for better or for worse. I 
just haven't been on this list for a while. I got tired of 80% drama and 10% 
music and 10% NRR. I recently resubscribe to post info about the spring time 
club thang I'm doing over at The Deli in SF.  But after posting the info and 
reading threads about what we as a community can do to keep our scene active 
and vibrant I was frankly astounded to see very little response, even when I 
offered free guestlist to anyone who knew me, or remotely knew me. 
 I couldn't believe the inertia. Here we did a 18+ $10 event w/ a full bar, 
Ghost, Joey, Dyloot, Dutch, etc., and offered no charge for those that 
responded by email and it was fully permitted. And yet for all the times peo
ple type about change it seems that there is very little real world 
participation.
 I wouldn't classify myself as a massive promoter. This may sound like a 
minute difference but Mystical Mayhem does do promotion for massive events 
but Mystical Mayhem events have never exceeded 4,000 people (Calaveras 1 yr. 
SERENITY) , and most were Maritime and 2nd and Jackson but a handful have 
been 500 peps (Signals, Orbit, etc.). How about midsize promoter? I have 
nothing against massives, I've just never done one.
 I'll continue to be candid as long as I am still subscribed. I totally agree 
w/ Terry's statement about there being more resources on this list than some 
would expect.
 I'll also hold out a challenge. For anyone who emails me before next Tuesday 
with their first and last names and snail mail address I will send them a 
ticket or pass or put them on the guestlist for Stamina Feb. 22 (2 days after 
my birthday, so bring kisses ladies). One person per email only. 
 Raving is a verb. Raving is an action not a mental endeavor. This list 
should be a supplement and forum, not a substitute for going out and dancing. 
And for all of those people out there who are wondering where are scene is..I 
ask where are you? Find a crew or event, support it, contribute, do art, do 
promotion, email ideas, bring awarness booths and show friends what the 
"scene" has to offer. Write a hiku about dancing and see if someone will put 
it on a flyer.
 And if you can't afford an event, plan in advance, contact the promoter, 
offer to help setup or cleanup. Not having money is a reality but using that 
as an excuse for not attending is the reasoning of the lazy, non 
contributing, not planning ahead type. If you want to be somewhere make it 
happen by adding to the experience of the event. I used to let people in for 
free who contacted me in advance and brought a drum, since they added 
production value and were participating.
 Below is the info on Stamina Feb 22 for those who leave the house.

Sincerely,
Yarrow

Actually, when you posted this I took the time to read the article.  Not 
bad.  The core of the discussion presented is, and I quote from Bill 
Werde's piece "Rave is Dead" (Urb, p. 62, Feb. '03):

"The ideals of rave -- peace, love, unity and respect to some, DIY to 
others -- live on in truly underground events and new rave converts and 
even in other parties, such as Burning Man.  But the business...The 
business of rave is crashing like a post-binge tweaker."

OK.  Raving was never about making money in the first place.  Werde goes on 
to cite club closures, decline in music sales, DJ bookings and the like -- 
all business-related activity.  And asserts it is no longer uber fashion 
amongst the teen set.  Cool.  Raving wasn't fashionable back in the day, 
either.

As he mentions, people have been sayin' "rave is dead" pretty much since 
raving began:)  Lots of people felt that when commercial interests entered 
the mix this killed raving (1995).

So, the business is gone, it's no longer cool, and we are back to where we 
were to begin with.  Good.  Or, as Derrick Carter described the early scene:

"You could rent someone's loft for the night for like, $300.  If you knew 
someone, maybe a cat's a little low on their rent?  One hundred and fifty 
dollars, $200 for the sound system, cover the kegs and everyone gets 50 
bucks lunch money or whatever.  'Cause shit!  I got all these records 
sitting in my house.  I don't eat properly and I look stupid cause I can't 
afford good clothes.  But I got these hot-ass records.  Shit!  These 
records gonna get heard.  I'm gonna have a party and play good records and 
laugh and see people we like and it'll be cool.  That was all right.  It 
was enough."  (Urb, p.64)

Word.  The love of music and friends was enough, and it still is.

Love,

Apollo

Bam! that's awesome. I need to get out of the damn house. :)
One... of... these... days ... I won't be flooded with work.
With luck I'll be at ryan's sfr houseparty tonight.

...Where some people will actually be painting banners out back for an
upcoming party. This is how you meet people and network with groups that put
on parties. Can't be passive about it! Get involved and go gung ho. Learn
what you can and ask questions. It's really fun in the infancy of learning
to throw parties. I miss those days. =)

see ya tonight

:: reply if you want the addy ::

Last heads up for tonight's SFRaves houseparty ( I'm not doing this as =
an official sfraves-planners thing for this event ). I'm trying to get =
people over that you've never met and I've never met under one roof. I =
think it's time to expand our circles and see each other again.=20

That means whatever you're doing you need to be at my house sometime =
tonight.=20

Open decks and we have a 2x4 setup ( 2 MKII's, 2 MKIII's, Vestax PMC250, =
Xone 62, CDJ-100) running through more sound than our house really needs =
(full racks of gear).=20

Bring whatever you want. movies, booze, food, party favors, whatever you =
want. I just want to see everyone come out and play!

It's going to be cozy and I'm sure memorable. Bring a friend that you =
normally don't party with. I just want to see everyone again and have =
fun.

Don't forget pj's and comfy stuff. Like I said we're going all night. I =
think I'll name one of the rooms The Den of Sin in honor of Scott.

9pm - until you pass out or leave

We have everything from house // breaks // jungle // 2-step // techno =
and more DJ wise so far.

BBQ is going

Emeryville is the location

Only thing asked is that people respect the house and have a good time.

mmm jello shots

Marching is old school.

Imagine a 200,000-person protest  "Street Party"  "Dance".

(((((....Back in the day raves were held in illegal locations.
People had to sneak generators into unusual places. They would haul in sound
and lighting and decks and vinyl..

In essence these mythical ravers would build a small city of joy for 8
hours.

Imagine using these old school skills to express your opinion, and
dance....))).

I have one big beef with most marches.
They just seem to be  a __dated__ vehicle for expression of opinion.


I think you could establish and broadcast a communal message more
effectively with a VJ and or a "in-tune" DJ.

Imagine big "bed sheet" movie screens with anti-war imagery provided by
slide and video. Behind a stage.

Or *better yet* a more amoebic approach. A whole block(s) lined with
different forms of artistic expression. Video, slides, tall puppetry,
Murals.

Instead of walking in a beeline to some far off destination.
The object would be to pool the humanity into a central location. A long
march disassociates the attendees. Everyone rushes home and turns on the
news and the news people lie and say it was only 2000 people. And EVERYONE
gets depressed and never goes to another march (because after all that work,
they didn't make the news)


But the important equation would be that people would come into close
proximity with each other, share a vibe.

I have been doing the sound systems for many protests for many years and
this is what I believe needs to happen.

If anyone wants to work with me on this dream please email me.

Hi everyone-
I would just like to say how proud I am of all of you who went to the march
on Saturday. At Love Allstars, countless people from the list came up to me
and told me they went because of my post. The march was awesome. I saw on
the
news that morning that "an estimated 10,000 people will be there"...ha ha ha
try 200,000 people. All day long I ran around and told older activists about
PLUR and what it represents. One person told me if we all lived by those 4
basic principles, we wouldnt be at that march, we wouldnt need to be.
Saturday was my frist massive demonstration and I will never forget it.
Thank
you to all who came and remember, with enough people, we can make a
difference
Britty

 From Davey D's Hip Hop Newsletter:


SFPD HATE ON 50 CENT


Friday nights highly anticipated 50 Cent performance at San Francisco's
Kelly's Mission Rock was shut down by the SFPD.  The ILL Trendz Productions
street team arrived as police had begun to attempt traffic control in front
of the venue.  An estimated 500 people waited to gain entrance to the club
patiently.  As ILL Trendz pulled up in a Nas Van Wrap and Mobile Billboard,
they chopped it up with Big Von, Gary Archer, DJ Spair, and Sadiki.
Suddenly the crowd near the door began to run as the SFPD approached.  4
squad car pulled up to the front of the club with various police officers
running in on foot.  As ILL Trendz departed fifteen minutes later, more
officers arrived and were seen carrying shotguns to the front club entrance.
ILL Trendz was disturbed to see such an uncordinated and large response to
the club.  The 50 Cent performance had been advertised over the past week
and was a presale only event.  Many people seemed shocked to see the SFPD
shut down the club.  Despite fears of violence at large club settings, the
evening had been uneventful.

EXACTLY!!!!

The whole idea of a protest is to gather and stand up for what you believe, 
artistic or not, but I have yet to go to a march where I did not see any 
form of beauty and creativity.  To bring more into this, art or muscic or 
whatever, would be a beautiful thing, but it seems that you are overlooking 
the reasons why people do gather to begin with.
Later,
Danny

Protest:
2. an expression of strong opposition to or disapproval of something in the 
form of a public demonstration or other action

Subject: Re: [sfraves] soundforge help

I read it and don't need to register to yet another board so I will give you 
the answer to pass on. In sound forge when you record there is a selection 
for pre and post roll and that is where the gap is coming from . To change 
this go to the Options Menu then go to Preferences then from there go to 
Other the make sure all the little time measures are at 0.00 except the Loop 
time because no matter what you do it will only allow you to put it at .10 
And also another reason if that does not work is when you compress audio 
into an MP3 it can change size and sound characteristics but in Soundforge 
you can edit MP3's as well so you can trim the edges if all else fails. Hope 
that helps if not let me know what does work I am always open to learning. 
Peace
     Jason

The only other soultion I might think of is go to downloads.com and look for 
the free .wav to .mp3 encoder it works well and no gaps or space added.

Hi All,
    Wow, last night was great! I went to Flex's resurrection at the =
Black Box in downtown Oakland. I was really impressed. The venue is =
fantastic. I was talking to someone behind the bar, and she said that =
they've been open for about a year, and mostly host performance art =
shows. This was there first "club" night. There were a lot of people =
there, much more than I ever saw at Flex's East Oakland spot. I only =
heard 2 sets, Qzen and Utraviolet, but they were both off the hook! =
Ultraviolet especially is sick, and brings incredible energy. Afterwards =
I headed over to Ryan's house for the SFR House Party. It was great =
seeing some faces I haven't seen in a while, and putting faces to some =
email addresses for the first time. I got to spin a 2x4 DnB set with =
Gfunk Jeff. It was the first time I've gotten to play with 2x4 and I'm =
totally hooked! I've tagteamed with people before, but you can do so =
much with 4 tables! I finally left around 6am, came home and crashed. I =
woke up around noon and could not get the music out of my head, so I =
finally gave up on sleeping and started streaming from bassdrive.com. I =
know I should try to sleep more, since I'm going out tonight, and don't =
wanna sleep through the superbowl tomorrow, but dammit, it's just too =
nice and sunny out today! I hope you all get to enjoy it.

Happy  :-)

but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes." -Hugh Downs

Eh? You need a license number to get Reason running. It should be on a

Subject: Re: [sfraves] good read'in for the musically inclined nrr

"also big, big fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

sometimes I hate Geri, sometimes I love her.

but how did she get past my filters?

regardless...my favorite thing about reading her posts is that it makes me
feel like I'm not alone...it's good to realize sfraves has more than one
resident lunatic...

I think Geri is actually onto something. I think the next wave to hit San
Francisco will be an influx of indie rockers, punk rockers, and even
alt.country rockers. nothing wrong with this, one of my favorite songs is an
alt.country tune ("Untouchable Face" by Ani DiFranco) -- but the city won't
look or sound the way it used to.

if you want to make the most of this, you should start a band. a year from
now you'll be one of the kings of the city, and five years from now (if you
play your cards right) you'll be partying at Hugh Hefner's mansion and doing
lines of coke off of Miss October's ass.

yay for you.

I think what this will mean for the rave scene is that the distinction
between massives and undergrounds will grow less pronounced as the entire
scene submerges underground again. that's basically a positive thing.
however, I think the only scenes that will see real growth during this
period will be those which ally themselves with rock music in some way. (if
you see industrial as a form of rock, which I do, but not everybody does,
you could reasonably assert that this is in fact already happening.)

I think the future for the rave scene might be brighter in other areas. I've
got to go, tho, so expect a less ambiguous and more reasonable e-mail on
this topic later today or possibly tomorrow.

Subject: [sfraves] BLACK LIGHTS SOLD + GEAR!!!!!

Hey Guys,

Thanks for all those that expressed interest in the gear.. But the bottom 
line is if you sleep you lose.. Only one person really stepped up to the 
plate and that person had cash so they got all 9 black lights + Gear..

But dont fret cause I may be having some audio recording gear up for sale in 
the near future G4 mac plus Virus A etc... But NO im not giving up on 
writing tracks but I might upgrade to the newer Dual G4 and a Nord lead II 
Module.. Watch this space..

Subject: [sfraves] New  Bay Area girl looking for chat/friend

Hey guys,
Sry if this in inappropriate for this list! neWays my name is Harmony, and I 
just moved into the bay area from New York last week. I totally don't know 
anyone yet, and would love someone who's tuned into the rave or club scene 
to chat with/meet with.  I don't really know ANYONE yet, just kind of 
starting anew, but I was active on the New York based site off hyperreal, so 
I thought I could try here first. So, I'm looking for anyone to kick it with 
(preferably an intelligent male...lol), so just hit me back if you can! I'll 
be 21 in a month too, so I'll be ready for the bay club scene.

Love,
Harmony

okay, further prognostications of doom for the SF rave scene are thankfully
delayed by the discovery of about ten to fifteen white label jungle remixes
of various rap and r&b tracks...including Brandy, Missy Elliot, Redman,
Ludacris...styles ranging from jump-up to that really scary isht that hurts

Enjoy it using anonymizer. If they want to log anonymizer's ip addy, more
power to them. They can spend all the time they want tracing it back later.
I doubt they will and even so they wouldn't get anywhere...

One day the government is going to push it's people too far and get it's
shit tossed out.

That's silly.

Apache, the server software they're running, logs all IP addresses by
default. Most webservers do - and it's not a big deal if you have any clue
how such things work. Something tells me this is a script kiddy joke,
which preys on the same naivete that makes those "Warning, This Computer
Is Broadcasting An IP Address!" sham ads work.

Typically, an IP address alone provides very little information (your ISP,
the company you're working from, info that could only be linked to you
personally by subpoena), unless you have a static connection in your name,
like what Vlad Cood was doing last year with his HonestAbe shenanigans.
(Hoooooo, that was dumb ;)

if you are trying to start a hoax, it is always better to convert the IP

http://www.cnn.com@1114581771/reports/2003/WORLD/0194/6050300.html
would look more believable then

God Bless U!  Love, Your sister in Christ, Tami

Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.    Philippians 4:4-7

That's silly.

Apache, the server software they're running, logs all IP addresses by
default. Most webservers do - and it's not a big deal if you have any clue
how such things work. Something tells me this is a script kiddy joke,
which preys on the same naivete that makes those "Warning, This Computer
Is Broadcasting An IP Address!" sham ads work.

Typically, an IP address alone provides very little information (your ISP,
the company you're working from, info that could only be linked to you
personally by subpoena), unless you have a static connection in your name,
like what Vlad Cood was doing last year with his HonestAbe shenanigans.
(Hoooooo, that was dumb ;)

thanks Mike,

I kinda knew that already, what fooled me a bit was that I was a Federal
employee a few years back and whenever I went to a banned addy, like
craigslist.or I'd get a similar message, the difference being that I was
warned that my terminal, not my IP was being logged.

this warning message looks close to the format they used.

looks like the reason the site is like this today is that Lyceauam may be
running a disinformation campaign of sorts today for the below reasons,

nic

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

It may be a shields up by the lyceaum people. CBS is airing a "scare the
parents
internet drug-information story" today. I heard that in advance they were
led
to believe it would become a balanced story.

This was presented to me by a well informed source that went speculating
about this.

A while ago lyceaum put up the same page as an april 1st joke so dont worry
about your IP number being logged (it always is!).

You're both not understanding-

"Your IP adress is being logged"

That does not mean "the IP address of the computer you're at is being
logged"

It means YOUR IP ADDRESS!!!
Yes- the IPv6 address that was coded in to silicon and implanted in
you at birth!

Everyone's eyes are contantly adjusting focus back and forth- the chip modifies the
rate of these refocuses so as to broadcast a unique IP address to
anything designed to pick such things up.

The only way to stop this is to use the internet with your eyes
closed.
It took a few weeks to get used to it but I can do 10WPM on my braille
terminal now!

Subject: [sfraves] Bye again

Hi SFRavers,

 Well, life has gotten busy again for me, so to free up more headspace
I will be unsubscribing once more.

 This last period was initiated by my curiosity as to whether there
would be an SFRaves 10 Year party ( there was , and I was glad to
be on staff for that ! ).

 Party safe, party kind, and dance/trance like no one's watching!

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

  One of my roommates is moving back up to Oregon in March, so there will be 
a room available, (maybe two if my other roomate decides to have another 
roomate) in a house in Oakland. The house is real nice, the neighborhood 
isn't too bad either, between the Lake Merrit/Eastlake districts, Fruitvale 
on the other side of the hill and close to the hills. The rent will be $550 
if we don't get another roomate, $400 if we decide to, plus utilites (water, 
gas, electric, phone, cable) which averages about $30-70 a month.
  Moderation, stable income and responsibility is what will get you 
considered, and you have to be willing to live with 4 loveable dogs.
  Drop me a responce if you are interested and we will talk.
  Peace, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Most if not all people that have DSL have static IPs...certainly any decent
multi-computer DSL service provides static IP addresses.

Caveat emptor.

That's silly.

Apache, the server software they're running, logs all IP addresses by
default. Most webservers do - and it's not a big deal if you have any clue
how such things work. Something tells me this is a script kiddy joke,
which preys on the same naivete that makes those "Warning, This Computer
Is Broadcasting An IP Address!" sham ads work.

Typically, an IP address alone provides very little information (your ISP,
the company you're working from, info that could only be linked to you
personally by subpoena), unless you have a static connection in your name,
like what Vlad Cood was doing last year with his HonestAbe shenanigans.
(Hoooooo, that was dumb ;)

mike

thanks Mike,

I kinda knew that already, what fooled me a bit was that I was a Federal
employee a few years back and whenever I went to a banned addy, like
craigslist.or I'd get a similar message, the difference being that I was
warned that my terminal, not my IP was being logged.

this warning message looks close to the format they used.

looks like the reason the site is like this today is that Lyceauam may be
running a disinformation campaign of sorts today for the below reasons,

regards,

nic

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

It may be a shields up by the lyceaum people. CBS is airing a "scare the
parents
internet drug-information story" today. I heard that in advance they were
led
to believe it would become a balanced story.

This was presented to me by a well informed source that went speculating
about this.

A while ago lyceaum put up the same page as an april 1st joke so dont worry
about your IP number being logged (it always is!).

My roommate moved out so there is a room now available in my house. : )

=A0=A0=A0=A0 The house is located in Marin in San Rafael in a safe, quiet se=

neighborhood but only minutes away from downtown (which hosts a major transi=

center), 101 and 580. It is 20 mins to Berkeley, 15 to the Golden Gate, and=20
35-45 to Santa Rosa.
=A0=A0=A0=A0 The house has a large semi-landscaped backyard, fireplace, dish=
washer=20
and washer. There is a laundry mat all of five houses down if you need to us=
e=20
a dryer. The laundry mat is also across the street from a quaint market with=
=20
nearly everything you need, there is a racquet club just up the hill if you=20
like to swim or play tennis, plenty of parking in addition to the four space=
s=20
for the house and many hiking trails surrounding the area. The house is also=
=20
usually filled with fresh flowers and plants that I receive from work (an=20
added bonus at no extra charge ; ) ).
=A0=A0=A0=A0 You get the largest room with your own phone line already=20
installed/hooked up. There is also a cable line installed ready to be hooked=

up. The dimensions of the room are 11'x12.5' with a closet and two windows.=20
Rent is 650 which *includes* utilities. It should be noted though, that it i=

a vegetarian kitchen. You can keep meat in the house, I would just prefer yo=
u=20
didn't cook it (though microwave stuff is okay). If you *really* need to coo=

it I just ask that you use your own pots/pans and clean thoroughly. You=20
should also know that I have a cat (short-haired). He is *very* sweet and=20
social and welcome to another kitty buddy if you have one. : D

And a bit about me- I'm an eighteen year old college student studying to be=20=

pyschoneuroimmunologist at the local college. I've been partying for four=20
years and I still go out regularly because I *love* to dance (why else would=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Fw: : Lyceaum shut down by DEA?


doesn't Erowid have an ancilliary relationship with us good folks here @
hypperreal.org, like aren't we all on the same bank of servers?

back in my my salad, Yippie! days on Bleecker Street, around the time
Abbie/Barry came out from the cold, somebody blew up an M-80 firecracker in
front of our HQ @ #9,  just as some beat cops were passing by, prompting the
local media to report it as a bomb going off.

When the report hit the radio, one of my comrades, on hearing the report
exulted:

'we're on the wire, we've gone *national!*'

Next thing I knew I got to shake hands with William Kuntsler @ an impromptu
press conference we threw to deal with it.

this cbs report puts me in mind of that incident, tempest in the ol' teapot.

kind of specious for Dan Rather to end the report with the line 'flirting
with death,' since as a young man he served in the Marines, bet he had a
encyclopedia of knowledge available to him @ the time to let him know what
he was getting into.

not that it would have helped.

thanks, Andy.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Theatre, relevant or not?(long)


Alida asks:

I'm doing a survey for a class and wanted to know:

With the advent of other forms of entertainment such as film, video and
reality TV, is live theatre relevant?

Why or why not?

*To add a little perspective:

-number of people that go to the theatre per year- 120 million

-number of people that go see top ten movies every year- 350 million +
another billion

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

and thank goodness for Jennifer's impassioned below response, nice to know
someone still feels that way, in this hyped up, super accelerated day and
age, and having met her at the SFR 10 yr party I have no doubt she's got a
decade or two of playing the ingenue in front of her.

; )

I'm adams, nic adams, i'm 38 and 7/8's, and i am a speaker, writer,
producer, independent contractor, i start revolutions, fit bras, empty bars,
tame tigers, fight wars, quell uprisings, organize orgies, run governments,
and as far as bongos, nails, whiskey, racing forms, fly swatters, nails,
land, and manure go, i can get 'em all for ya wholesale.

i've been busy, but wanted to get back to this post, but it's mad late, so i
won't give this a full blown answer, or mebbe i will because it's an
inneresting question....

i'm a lil knocked out that things have gotten so far that a friend of
Jennifer's would get confused about a character she plays on the stage,
welcome to our modern world i guess.

I grew up in NYC and Broadway, the Great White Way is in my blood, used to
pedal down it every nite on my way home.....

Everybody wants to get into the Broadway act, this song,
http://tinyurl.com/4zla especially the Neil Young version, has always
expressed that for me.

In a nutshell, to put it into perspective, along the lines you posted up
above, for your survey, Alida, consider this, please:

This week, alone, more people will sit through the current crop of reality
shows than all people who have sat through *all* live performances of *all*
Shakespeare's plays, in *all* theatres in the world that they've ever been
put in, since we humans have started producing them....

**COMBINED**

Thing is, Shakespeare was planted in the ground, his bones not to be
disturbed, a good 500 years ago or so.

"shall i compare thee to a midsummer's day....?'

500 years from now, if we're still around, is anyone going to remember any
David E. Kelley shows, like Allie McBeal, which undoubtably more people have
seen during its run than all Shakespeare's plays, combined, or who Joe
Milionaire picked and what her reaction was when she learned the *awful*
truth?

They might sit still for 'I Love Lucy' reruns though.

(tangental as hell: Ironic, inn't? Kind of like Kurt Cobain being named
artist of the decade by Rolling Stone, though he had been dead for most of
it...)

is live theatre relevant to our lives?

umm yeah....

robert pirsig covers some of this territory in his discussion of Chataqua's
from his book,

'Zen and the Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance,'
http://tinyurl.com/1ngu

and though he was kind of talking about something else some of the below is
germane in response to question of modern day relevance of live theatre,
since the Chataqua he speaks of is a form of live theatre:

"What is in mind is a sort of Chautauqua...that's the only name I can think
of for it...like the traveling tent-show Chautauquas that used to move
across America, this America, the one that we are now in, an old-time series
of popular talks intended to edify and entertain, improve the mind and bring
culture and enlightenment to the ears and thoughts of the hearer.

The Chautauquas were pushed aside by faster-paced radio, movies and TV, and
it seems to me the change was not entirely an improvement.

Perhaps because of these changes the stream of national consciousness moves
faster now, and is broader, but it seems to run less deep.

The old channels cannot contain it and in its search for new ones there
seems to be growing havoc and destruction along its banks.

In this Chautauqua I would like not to cut any new channels of consciousness
but simply dig deeper into old ones that have become silted in with the
debris of thoughts grown stale and platitudes too often repeated.

"What's new?"

is an interesting and broadening eternal question, but one which, if pursued
exclusively, results only in an endless parade of trivia and fashion, the
silt of tomorrow.

I would like, instead, to be concerned with the question

"What is best?,"

a question which cuts deeply rather than broadly, a question whose answers
tend to move the silt downstream. There are eras of human history in which
the channels of thought have been too deeply cut and no change was possible,
and nothing new ever happened, and "best" was a matter of dogma, but that is
not the situation now.

Now the stream of our common consciousness seems to be obliterating its own
banks, losing its central direction and purpose, flooding the lowlands,
disconnecting and isolating the highlands and to no particular purpose other
than the wasteful fulfillment of its own internal momentum.

Some channel deepening seems called for."


Seems to me that some of this 'channel deepening' he talks about is more
likely to come from live performance of art than video presentation of it,
so yeah, it's hella relevant, cuz if anything, don't you have a sense that
this lack of depth is something our culture is currently yearning for?

Or maybe it's just me, and what do i know, i still haven't outgrown my MTV.

k, i could go on, and on and on and on, and i prolly will, but you're on a
deadline for that survey of yours, but I got me some the original 39
'Honeymooner' episodes lined up right now, and oddly enough, in the half
century they've been around they're one of the few shows that have
maintained their relevance over time.

how many others can you name from today's current crop of shows that are
going to be around 50 years hence?

good luck, bet it's a mighty short list.

nic

who'd have *no problem* going mano a mano with
Virginia Woolf, c'mon and bring 'er on.

***I am posting this to SFR because dammit this is something I feel
incredibly passionate about, more than most anything in my life. Whereas
raving has saved many of us on the list, theatre saved mine.***

Oh my goodness I could write a book on this subject...

I have been involved with live theatre for over 10 years now...god that
seems long! I have three associates degrees in technical theatre, acting and
direction but decided to forgo Theatre as a bachelors degree because what
director gives a crap if you have a degree. They want to know if you can DO.
I have been a techie building sets, hanging lights, running the board, and I
have been involved in 30 something (my bf counted I have not) productions
from Shakespeare, musical theatre, comedy, modern drama to vaudeville etc.

Anyway I feel that live theatre has huge relevance. I know this not only
from my standpoint, but from the view of some friends of mine who had never
been to a live performance until they had attended one of my shows.

Movies and tv may have all of the effects and glamour but there is nothing
like live theatre to suck you in. Having real, live breathing people in
front of you living the lives of wonderful characters can really give you a
charge. It's the ultimate in voyeurism. Real emotions can be seen and felt
(especially in some of the SRO, standing room only theatres I've worked in).
Of course the actors and directors have to be doing their job...sucky shows
can't do that for me though regardless of a show bombing or not I still have
that longing to be up there.

I think a lot of people don't go to theatre because they don't know about
it, or have never gone. Such was the case of several of my friends. It might
seem to be something uptight and they think they have to act a certain way
to see a show. Like it's a gala affair where you have to dress up. Sometimes
the show and what it makes them feel is threatening. TV can make you brain
dead but having three hours of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe being thrown
into your face and brain is anything but. One theatre newbie friend could
hardly talk to me after that show. He kept asking questions of me as if I
was the character, like he had trouble differentiating us. That show really
screwed with his head (as it did with the actors every night) as it should
have.

I would encourage anyone to see at least one show in their life. Community
theatre is where it's happening in my opinion where you can see normal every
day folks working very hard on their craft because they love it not because
they get a paycheck. These shows are usually pretty cheap to, cheaper than a
movie and popcorn now-a-days. It may just change your life.

Rant off :)

Any more questions Alida?

Subject: [sfraves] Moda on ALICE (bsp)

Hello everyone! I haven't posted in some time to the list, yet I have been
monitoring and emailing peeps privately. I hope that everyone is doing well
and would love to get involved in another SFR Dinner.

Anyways, for those who are interested, Thump Radio will be airing my live
NYE performance in celebration of my forthcoming album, The Tribal Realm, on
ALICE 97.3 at midnight, this Saturday. The show will feature one hour of my
original and some of my remix material. The album will feature ambient
reprises of my original tribal songs much and will sound much along the
lines of a Deep Forest or Enigma. The deadline for release is August 2003.

Forthcoming interviews, dj sets an the Tribal Realm performance will also be
airing Feb 7th on Channel 933 in San Diego and at 1am on Feb 27th on XM
Satellite Radio.

An interview and a show featuring my music are on show 24 which is airing
this month on the DISH network, entitled ANGEL ONE. I believe it is 242
shown in California 12:30AM or 30 minutes after midnights on Fridays.

What else has been going on? My music has also been licensed to appear on a
forthcoming pilot series on Fox, this summer, called "Keen Eddie". I am
currently working on other projects as well for Warner Bros. And Paramount.
 
I am also a member of a new band featuring Patrick Scott, Daniel Ash and
myself. Our debut single, a remake of the classic Blondie hit, Rapture has
just been completed and we begin work on our first album, next month.

Hope all is well! 8) MODA

You should go for the all inclusive, Thump, Alice, SFRaves dinner live
broadcast. That would be pretty trick... Only problem is that pesky midnight
time. =)

Subject: [sfraves] Moda on ALICE (bsp)


Hello everyone! I haven't posted in some time to the list, yet I have been
monitoring and emailing peeps privately. I hope that everyone is doing well
and would love to get involved in another SFR Dinner.

Anyways, for those who are interested, Thump Radio will be airing my live
NYE performance in celebration of my forthcoming album, The Tribal Realm, on
ALICE 97.3 at midnight, this Saturday. The show will feature one hour of my
original and some of my remix material. The album will feature ambient
reprises of my original tribal songs much and will sound much along the
lines of a Deep Forest or Enigma. The deadline for release is August 2003.

Forthcoming interviews, dj sets an the Tribal Realm performance will also be
airing Feb 7th on Channel 933 in San Diego and at 1am on Feb 27th on XM
Satellite Radio.

An interview and a show featuring my music are on show 24 which is airing
this month on the DISH network, entitled ANGEL ONE. I believe it is 242
shown in California 12:30AM or 30 minutes after midnights on Fridays.

What else has been going on? My music has also been licensed to appear on a
forthcoming pilot series on Fox, this summer, called "Keen Eddie". I am
currently working on other projects as well for Warner Bros. And Paramount.

I am also a member of a new band featuring Patrick Scott, Daniel Ash and
myself. Our debut single, a remake of the classic Blondie hit, Rapture has
just been completed and we begin work on our first album, next month.

Hope all is well! 8) MODA

I can't get too upset. Four fake news stories is about average for the front

for the addicted: i thought i was going to be able to go on-line in a time and place yesterday, but when that time and place arrived, there was not a computer, and i was not able to change the situation and look after myself, so, i skipped my post/column, writing piece, reply, and i was also kind of worried that maybe someone might be worried too, and then i was thinking about how maybe the worried one or ones wouldn't know that i was too cold and worrying and sort of getting sick and all of that, and then maybe they would and then would be worried or totally angry or something like that, and then i just told myself to FOCUS on the present, and well, here's my post...lots of good news going around these days...i won't bore anyone with detailed descriptions, but, well, i got some really cool girl products in pastels...i wasn't going to, but then i am sort of a collector of sorts, i suppose, and while i was talking myself into being more conservative about purchasing...i've been playing catch up, basically....but while i was talking myself into being conservative, i saw some REALLY, REALLY cute additions that fit REALLY, REALLY well, so i figured that the powers that be might let me get away with it. :)

Wheels are turning and a movie might possibly be made...

The topic does not matter- the only requirements are that it be
feature-length and not too heavy on costume/set requirements.
And uhm- interesting- I'm a heavy judge of such things so be prepared
for me to say "no I don't like it" :)

You have a screenplay/story/script that you would like made in to a
movie?
Send it to me- if I like it- maybe that will happen.
You'll be credited as usual etc etc blah blah blah :)

Kazaa Sues Movie, Recording Industries
http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20030128/ap_on_hi_te/internet_music_trial 



Sharman Networks Ltd. filed its counterclaim Monday in response to a 
copyright-infringement lawsuit brought by several recording labels and 
movie studios. That lawsuit accuses Sharman of providing free access to 
copyright music and films to millions of Internet users in the United States.

The latest filing came two weeks after U.S. District Judge Stephen V. 
Wilson dismissed Sharman's claim that it could not be sued in the United 
States because it is based in Australia and incorporated in the South 
Pacific nation of Vanuatu.

Wilson had found Sharman subject to U.S. copyright laws because it has 
substantial usage by Californians and its actions are alleged to contribute 
to commercial piracy within the United States.

Sharman's counterclaim alleges copyright misuse, monopolization, and 
deceptive acts and practices.

"In seeking to simultaneously stop illegal copying and to maintain their 
dominant position in the distribution of musical and movie content, the 
industry plaintiffs have obscenely overreached," Sharman said.

It seeks a jury trial, damages, attorney fees and a permanent injunction 
against the entertainment industry so that it can't "enforce any of their 
United States copyrights against any person or entity."

Sharman said the entertainment companies are behind the times and don't 
realize that consumers need not buy CDs, DVDs or videotapes to enjoy music 
or films.

Sharman also claimed that movie studios "dominate and, when they act in 
concert, have monopoly power" for the aftermarket distribution of first-run 
major motion pictures. Likewise, the company said, recording labels "when 
they act in concert, have monopoly power in the distribution of recorded 
music."

Movie studios involved in the lawsuit include Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios 
Inc., Columbia Pictures Industries Inc., Disney Enterprises Inc., Paramount 
Pictures Corp. The recording labels are BMG, EMI, Sony, Universal and Warner.

In a statement, the Recording Industry Association of America (news - web 
sites) called Sharman's arguments "laughable."

"Sharman's claims are akin to the thief who plunders Fort Knox and then 
claims she's not responsible because Fort Knox declined to buy her 
second-rate security system," the RIAA said.

The case is one of the largest in the recent online copyright wars testing 
the international reach of U.S. courts.

Hey everyone,
I just wanted to let u know about another war on Feb. 15. For more infor go 
to internationalanswer.org, they'll give u all the info. There is stuff going 
on in S.F., Sac, and other neighboring places.
Also, I'm going to be at Dreamland on Friday. Email me if you're going to be 
there. I dont know what I'm going to wear yet, but I have blond hair which is 
shaved on the back and sides, more than likely it will be in pigtails.
Britty

Subject: [sfraves] Urgent, SFLNC needs your support

--0-1252886046-1043863587=:40492
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

SFLNC Members,

Please excuse the late notice of this request and read on to find out 
why your action is needed TODAY!

The San Francisco Late Night Coalition needs people to attend a hearing
tomorrow, Wednesday - January 29th at 6 PM in room 416 of City Hall. 
The hearing is at the Board of Permit Appeals and is a request by the 
Lingba Lounge to receive a Place of Entertainment Permit (POE) and overturn 
the Police Department's denial of their request.

To read more go to: http://www.lingba.com/Lingba_Home.htm

The SFLNC became involved in this issue when the owner of the lounge, 
Cody Robertson, contacted us to find out if it was true that he needed to 
have a permit for his friends to play music in his 49 person cocktail 
lounge. It turns out that the previous owners had a juke box which Cody 
replaced with turntables and he did not realize at the time that making that 
change triggered the requirement to have a POE, just like 1015 Folsom or Ruby
Skye.

His neighbors (the Potrero Boosters) got involved in opposing his application and in that neighborhood, that spelled disaster.  Cody changed his sound system and passed a sound inspection by the SFPD but that was not enough.  It seems forgiveness is not big on the "Hill" and nothing Cody could do would stop the system from denying him his permit. He even operated in the same manner as a couple of SOMA bars that don't have a POE, but to no avail.  He was cited on Saturday and his turntables seized by the SFPD.

To read about this go to: http://www.sfbg.com/37/18/news_lingba.html

And that takes us to the hearing.  When you are denied a permit, you have
the right to appeal that decision to the Board of Permit Appeals and that
is what he is doing.  Until the police seized his turntables this last Saturday, he planned for the hearing to be low key.  But the Potrero Boosters have been urging residents who oppose the Lingba Lounge to fill the hearing room and so we must do the same.

Show your support of San Francisco Culture; tell the government to 
support the entertainment community by showing up at the hearing.

You will not be required to speak; your presence in the audience will 
be enough.

I hope to see you there!

Respectfully,

Terrance Alan
Chairperson
San Francisco Late Night Coalition

Subject: [sfraves] I'm back

That's right all, I'm back...
    Just thought that I'd say hi and let you all know that I am back in the 
city.  I was arrested last Sunday night on some bogus charges by the SFPD 
(which were dropped by the DA, probably because of a lack of evidence).  
They roughed me up pretty good and stripped me naked and paraded me around 
the jail.  They didn't give me any clothes until 9:30 the next morning 
because I was "a threat to myself and others," although I was detained in a 
"Safety Cell" by myself for a majority of the evening.  I'm doing better now 
though.  This is my first day of attending class because of all of the BS 
that I have had to deal with the last few days.  Most of my bruises are 
going away and doing better now.  Anybody down to do some booty shakin' this 
weekend?  I need to do a little promoting for a party, but most of all I 
need to get my groove on.  Anybody who wants to chill, hit me back.
Lots of love,
Trendy, aka Malacai

Subject: Re: [sfraves] I'm back

We were walking home from the bar at about 12:30 and we were picked up for 
public intoxication.  I thought it was BS and I didn't refrain from sharing 
my opinion.  They (the people with the cuffs) didn't like my verbal 
rebellion.  I used a lot of demeaning language and I got hog-tied and beaten 
in response.  To be honest, I didn't have the most cooperative attitude and 
I asked a lot of questions.  I don't think it really takes much to piss off 
the SFPD though.  Especially after the brutal superbowl loss; the boys in 
blue were itchin' for some redemption.  It wasn't a barrel full of monkeys, 
but I learned an important lesson.  Cops are just frat-boys who weren't 
smart enough to get into college.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] I'm back

Picked up for drunk in public.  The cops wouldn't take a breathalizer or 
bloodtest to confirm or deny our intoxication status.  I assume that's why 
we were held without setting bail and that's why the DA dropped the charges. 
  They knew it was SH!7, we knew it was sh!7, it doesn't take a lot of 
innovative logic to figure out when cops are having a bad night.  I wouldn't 
suggest playing on their fears and insecurities; it just makes them want to 
do more f()c8ed up stuff to you.  Cops suck...  Sorry, couldn't refrain...

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - cybrid is looking for gigs

Hello,

If you're looking to book someone to play at your party, club, or event,
you should consider my live PA Cybrid.
Please take a moment to visit our website, and check out some info, mp3s,
and pictures of us at past gigs.

We're also available individually for dj sets. Jim (Skoop) plays
new-school electro, IDM, and glitchy techno. As Audioel, I play funky
electro, breaks, tech-house, deep house, and minimal techno.

If you don't know who we are, we're local SF-based musicians who've been
part of the club scene for many years. My previous live PA - Protolab -
played at many parties and events from '94 to 2001. :)

Write back if you're interested.

Thanks!

- Gustavo

Subject: [sfraves] Terry Mullan in SF this Friday?

I remember seeing a flyer on the street indicating that Terry Mullan is
playing some record release party at a venue on Howard Street this
Friday night (January 31st)... but the details escape my memory. A
couple web searches later and I've found nothing more. Does anyone have
the details on that?

Thanks.

Some believe the "go" date for the invasion is February 5th.  If that is 
so, a number of people will hit the streets in protest.

The next large march and rally for San Francisco is scheduled for February 
16th, Sunday, not the 15th.  The change was made to accommodate the Chinese 
New Year's Celebration.

As many of you know, we have organized a group called Ravers for Peace from 
interested parties on this list.  Ravers for Peace will participate in the 
February 16th event.

Love,

Apollo

Actually, I'm pretty sure Feb 05 is the date that the US is supposed to
present evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to the UN, in order
to garner support for an invasion in late Feb or mid-March.  Then again,
that's what the corporate news whores have reported in the last couple of
days, so I could be totally misled :)

Hi all, wanted to pass the word if you hadn't already heard:

DEA Moves to Schedule Two More "Hallucinogens"

Yesterday (28 Jan. 2003) the Drug Enforcement Administration moved to
place two more "hallucinogens" into Schedule I of the federal Controlled
Substances Act.

The two substances are Alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT) and
5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT).

Lots of speculation here.  Some think Bush may go on the 5th after the 
presentation.   Strategically, February is supposed to be good weather for 
war in Iraq.  Then, there is pressure to end the uncertainty about war that 
is affecting the stock markets -- ASAP.

Most people, however, think this invasion is inevitable whether there is 
support in the UN or not. Of course we will win initially:  at the cost of 
hundreds of thousands of civilian lives destroyed by either military action 
or post-invasion collapse of infrastructure.

Immoral,  preemptive warfare (only "defensive" war is considered just in 
Western convention) is only the beginning of the horrors to come.

Everyone wants a piece of Iraq.  Iran, for example, will not officially 
stand in the way of regime change there but, as one senior official said 
recently:  "If the Americans stay more than a few weeks, then we will 
declare a holy war on them."  Victory will not be sweetness and light 
here.  We are marching into quicksand...

Love,

Apollo

Int'l Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (A.N.S.W.E.R.) Coalition

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROTEST AND WALKOUTS

The day a new US war on Iraq starts - emergency protest at Powell and 
Market St at 5 p.m., the next day at 5 p.m. if the war begins at night, 
followed by a march through city neighborhoods.

THE MORNING AFTER THE WAR STARTS -- WALK OUT/STAYAWAY! ORGANIZE WALK OUTS 
from school, work, etc. Spend the morning leafleting for people to join the 
anti-war movement. Converge mid-day at noon at Civic Center Plaza to 
protest the war. The ANSWER Coalition is preparing a flyer that will be on 
the web site calling for people to walk out on the day after an attack.

We urge activists in other cities and towns to organize similar activities.

THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY, mass protest rally and marches. Leaflets and local 
times and locations of demonstrations will be available on 
www.internationalanswer.org

In San Francisco, the 5 PM day-of emergency response protest gathers at 
Powell at Market St. 12 noon convergence the day after the war starts 
gathers at City Hall at Grove and Polk St. The Saturday after mass protest 
gathers at UN Plaza at 7th and Market Streets.

For updates and questions - call the ANSWER-SF office at 415-821-6545 or 
check the website at www.InternationalANSWER.org.

Thanks for clarifying, I read about them changing the date after I posted 
that message. I have heard about some events possibly happening on Feb, 21st 
in honor of Malcom X. I have no actual info on that yet, but can keep you 
posted. I made a big decision after watching the state of the union address, 
I'm going to the Republikan national Convention in August to protest. it is 
all the way in New York...which u know what that mean *sigh*, only one rave a 
month for me, unless there r 2 REALLY good ones, I'm kind of stuck about 
March bc there r so many good parties/. Well I doubt anyone is planning to go 
to the RNC, but if you are, email me...

out there have a FETISH for SHOES??? 

first name SHOE, last name FETISH

i don't get turned on by shoes, however, i do like them a whole lot....i have been having a life long love affair with boots, as an example...i always tell people about my first pair, and i can't remember if i posted about them here or not before...wouldn't be surprised if i did....i had a pair of white go-go boots when i was 4-1/2 years old....lately, i only have one pair of boots...sometimes, i have owned several pairs at a time...when i have them, i really, really use them, and they get completely worn out...i have a good pair in excellent condition now...i had to look around for a long time for them too....i knew i was in the market for a pair this season, but there wasn't a decent pair to be found, except on the feet of others..:)...finally found something cute, but there is nothing unusual about them...i saw a fine looking pair of pink high top converse yesterday....wouldn't gone for it, but they were too small. :)

Subject: [sfraves] [nrr] nicaraguan animals about to starve?

i couldn't find anything about this in any of the major media outlets, just
a picture in sfgate.com's "picture of the day":

http://www.sfgate.com/news/pictures/2003/01/29/managua7.jpg

"Dear world, stomach rumbling, send meat: Tina the Bengal tiger enjoys a
head rub from National Nicaraguan Zoo veterinarian Eduardo Sacasa in
Managua.
The zoo's 454 animals are down to their last six days of food following
the government's decision to cut off zoo funding. The zoo was told to seek
handouts from other zoos around the world."

lets step back from this whole iraq thing and think out our furry pals, whom
are being held captive against their will, and thanks to bureaucratic
nonsense, will soon be out of food.

i'd be willing to go without a meal for a day to feed some starving
animals...

Subject: [sfraves] The 'Illicit' Drug Anti-Proliferation Act Second New Version of the Rave Act

 
They dinn't waste any time, this is S.226 another
version of the bill, s.22, that was introduced a few
weeks back.

i had a sense they were going to take it up a notch
this year.

From:

http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/

New RAVE ACT 

The RAVE Act is back!! 

Its now called the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation
Act. 

DONT BE FOOLED! Its the RAVE Act in new clothing.
Last year you helped stop the RAVE Act from becoming
law. We need your help again. Fax Senators and tell
them that this bill hurts innocent business owners,
undermines public safety, and stifles free speech and
musical expression.

clearly i've not missed a meal. there's no joking about that, never get
between a fat person and their food.

i think the joke is:
them: "wow greg, i can't belive you ate that whole sub."
me: "i'm a professional fat person, we don't fuck around."

how are those leg warmers working for you philip?

this is going to be good...could be better, but i can't type very much these days...why don't more people question things? well, if you imagine the following senario..."honey, why are you working with a bunch of moral and emotional sell-outs?"  questions like that don't fly too well over dinner when your trying to make the magic happen in your relationship, do they? plus, you never know how volatile the reply might be...better just keep eating those hotdogs and doing your homework, because if you don't, you'll get it from your school and your temporary guardians....remember, many people have eyes and ears, but many people aren't aware. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] why more people don't question things nrr

more people are aware than you think, babydoll.

if someone questioned me over dinner, as you
suggested, with the assumption that i had not thought
of the same question myself, "why are you working with
a bunch of moral and emotional sell-outs?", i might
perhaps say something like, "because i'm biding my
time and paying my fucking bills till something better
comes along."  

truth be told, i consider myself lucky at the moment
to be working and associating with people that i don't
see as being sell-outs.  and truth be told, we're all
sell-outs anyway, in the great big ol' grand scheme of
things.

questions like that don't fly well over dinner because
they ignore one too-oft overlooked aspect of reality -
and that is, we've all got our reasons and just
because *you* don't know what they are, doesn't mean
that no one else does.  to me, that is a beautiful
example of the kind of ignorance that works most
effectively as an obstacle to "making" magic happen in
relationships.

have a great thursday y'all.

;)sooz

Subject: [sfraves] Action Alert! Biden Introduces New RAVE Act!!!

It only takes a few seconds to fax your senator! please do it! Let 
them know we won't stand for the destruction of our freedoms! This 
kind of misguided legislation is just one example of how the so 
called "War on Drugs" has turned our country into a virtual police 
state.


 From The Drug Policy Alliance:
------------------------------------------
*** Biden Introduces New RAVE Act!!!
*** Your Help Urgently Needed

Several weeks ago we warned you that last year's RAVE Act was
incorporated into Sen. Daschle's domestic security bill (S. 22). It
gets worse. Senators Biden (D-DE), Grassley (R-IA), Feinstein (D-CA),
and Lieberman (D-CT) have introduced it as a stand-alone bill (S.
226 - which is not posted on thomas.loc.gov yet. We'll link from our
site,  http://www.drugpolicy.org , once it becomes available). It's
not called the RAVE Act. Nor does it have a findings section talking
about raves or electronic music. It's now called the Illicit Drug
Anti-Proliferation Act. DON'T BE FOOLED! It's the RAVE Act in new
clothing. If enacted, it would harm innocent business owners,
undermine public safety, and stifle free speech and musical
expression.

Your help is needed to stop this disguised RAVE Act from becoming
law!!!

*** Fax your two Senators. Tell them to oppose S. 226 the Illicit
     Drug Anti-Proliferation Act. You can use our convenient system:
     http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/

     Or find your Senators's fax number at:
     http://www.senate.gov

*** Please forward this action alert to your friends and family. The
     Senate needs to know that voters find this bill unacceptable.

For more information on the RAVE Act and S. 226 see:
http://www.nomoredrugwar.org/music/rave_act.htm

Please consider making a donation to help the Drug Policy Alliance
continue to fight for our rights: http://www.drugpolicy.org/join

We need your support to stop this bill!
---------------------------------------------------

Once again, we all have to get together and make our voice heard!


Regards,

Andy Somers

*** Biden Introduces New RAVE Act!!!
*** Your Help Urgently Needed

Several weeks ago we warned you that last year's RAVE Act was
incorporated into Sen. Daschle's domestic security bill (S. 22). It
gets worse. Senators Biden (D-DE), Grassley (R-IA), Feinstein (D-CA),
and Lieberman (D-CT) have introduced it as a stand-alone bill (S.
226 - which is not posted on thomas.loc.gov yet. We'll link from our
site,  http://www.drugpolicy.org , once it becomes available). It's
not called the RAVE Act. Nor does it have a findings section talking
about raves or electronic music. It's now called the Illicit Drug
Anti-Proliferation Act. DON'T BE FOOLED! It's the RAVE Act in new
clothing. If enacted, it would harm innocent business owners,
undermine public safety, and stifle free speech and musical
expression.

Your help is needed to stop this disguised RAVE Act from becoming
law!!!

*** Fax your two Senators. Tell them to oppose S. 226 the Illicit
     Drug Anti-Proliferation Act. You can use our convenient system:
     http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/

     Or find your Senators's fax number at:
     http://www.senate.gov

*** Please forward this action alert to your friends and family. The
     Senate needs to know that voters find this bill unacceptable.

For more information on the RAVE Act and S. 226 see:
http://www.nomoredrugwar.org/music/rave_act.htm

Please consider making a donation to help the Drug Policy Alliance
continue to fight for our rights: http://www.drugpolicy.org/join

We need your support to stop this bill!

You can't deal with the aftermath in Afghanistan, move on to Iraq.  War on 
Drugs an international failure, introduce anti-Rave acts and lock up 
American citizens.  One hears relatively little about the situation in the 
brave new democracy of Afghanistan and, as Philip said, "where is Osama bin 
Laden?"

Failing Anti-terror Campaign: Afghani Drug Flow Unchanged

Thur, Jan 30, 2003


According to Russia's Border Guard Service, the US-led anti-terror 
operation in Afghanistan has done nothing to reduce the flow of illegal 
drugs. Russia is a major transit point for Afghan opium and heroin making 
its way to the lucrative markets of Western Europe. Russian officials have 
repeatedly complained about the continuing trade.

Russia has apparently provided the U.S. and its allies with data on drug 
storage and production sites in Afghanistan without result. Russia's 10,700 
border guards stationed in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, 
bordering Afghanistan, had prevented about 90 drug smuggling attempts, 
detained 65 illegal border crossers, and seized more than 4 tons of illegal 
drugs last year, however these have minor impact on the massive market.

Interdiction efforts by the US and Russia will remain futile without 
appropriate development resources for opium farmers in the devastated 
country of Afghanistan. The current war against drugs continues to increase 
the cost of drugs, making drug trafficking more profitable and therefore 
more attractive - particularly to those living in poverty.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: The Digital Music Education Foundation

The Digital Music Education Foundation (DMEF) is a not for profit
corporation founded in 2002 with the goal of using music production,
playback, and manipulation technologies to teach math and science to
elementary and secondary school students particularly in economically
challenged and diverse urban school districts.  Currently we are in the
process of developing our first programs and curricula for the 2003-2004
school year and we plan to have at least one after school or in school
program operating in San Francisco this fall.  We hope to expand from there
to additional schools and other cities.

While we are in the process of raising funding from the usual corporate
donors, we are seeking additional help from the rave and electronic music
communities directly to make this project a reality.  Naturally cash
donations are accepted, but we are also looking for donations of music
equipment of all sorts, office space (we are willing to share a space), and
more.

We are currently looking for volunteers to help us create our website,
produce marketing materials, to help with the development of our math and
science curricula, to teach courses, etc.  If you think you might be able to
help out please drop us a note describing your skills, experience, and
expertise as well as how you think you could help.  Sorry these are all
unpaid volunteer only positions at this time.

We also are in the early stages of planning a benefit event for the spring
or summer, and and would like to hear from promoters, DJs, and venue owners
that might be able to help us make this event a success.

The DMEF is a 501c(3) non-profit corporation and all donations are tax
deductible.

If you have anything to offer, including just a few words of support, please
e-mail me directly off the list at rothmans@gte.net.

Warm regards,

Peter Rothman
President & Founder, DMEF

I've been pondering this myself.  Perhaps there will be one of those 
cardboard stand-up figures of "JJ" at "RS" with some prerecorded 
"music."   And obviously, the "tickets" don't really exist -- they are 
"virtual."

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] Lingba Lounge Update...

--0-360643774-1043970546=:20819
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


Last night the Board of Permit Appeals met to hear Lingba Lounges request that the Police Departments denial of Lingbas Place of Entertainment (POE) permit application be overturned.  (The police denied his permit and he wanted that decision overturned).

 The room was packed to overflowing.  The item was put at the end of the calendar and was finally heard at 7 PM.

 The Police, represented by Sgt Bill Coggin, presented their case for denial based on the failure of the Planning Department to decide if the POE use was permitted at Lingbas property.  

 The Planning Department, represented by Larry Badner, presented their case that Planning was notified of the requested POE, sent out a public notice and received a request for a Discretionary Review (DR) of the application.  That DR request meant that the case had to go before the Planning Commission, but there was no Planning Commission (remember).  So before that review was scheduled the Police decided that since they had not heard from the Planning Department, it must mean they said no and advised Planning that they had denied the permit.  And so, of course, Planning cancelled the DR process.  

 Yes folks, it was a classic Catch-22 situation.  

 Attorney for Lingba, Mark Rennie, argued the case that Lingba had a constitutional right to the POE.  The Lingba was zoned for entertainment and that since the majority of opposition was about sound complaints and Lingba had passed its sound test, they deserved the permit.  Mark went on to point out that San Francisco had better wake up to the diminishing hotel tax revenue resulting from a loss of tourism and invest in its entertainment community to get the tourists back in town.  I personally loved his line that San Francisco seems to eat its young when describing the obvious generation gap between those opposed to Lingba and those in favor of it.

 So what was decided after hearing all the testimony of the neighbors about how horrible Lingba Lounge was to the neighborhood and after hearing from the Lingba folks how great it was to have the Lingba in the neighborhood, that the case would be held at the call of the chair so that the Planning Department could hold its DR process.

 Comments from the Commissioners gave a glimpse as to how they felt on the merits of the case and how they might rule if the application comes before them again, which they expect it to.  Their comments were generally that Lingba had better get together with the neighbors and work out a mitigating plan and the neighbors had better agree to meet in earnest to develop that plan.  The lack of trust in each other was noted by most of the Commissioners.  I think that the key to this success is for the Lingba bend over backwards and try to find common ground with the neighbors.  Document the effort and be prepared to defend their process.

 So now Lingba must do a DR in front of the Planning Commission and the Commission  will decide if his proposed POE use is allowed and tell the Police Department, if a POE is allowed and with what, if any conditions.

 Then the police will hold a hearing and decide if Lingba gets its permit.  And if they deny it we are back to the Board of Permit Appeals to have them hear the case.

 My take on this is that the case has gotten everyones attention and that done carefully; Lingba will get its POE.  The POE may have restrictions and some of those may be onerous, but after a successful year of operation, Lingba can petition the Entertainment Commission to review and change the restrictions.

 So there we are.  Light years ahead of what would have happened two years ago when the Lingba would have been trounced.

 The advocacy of the SFLNC and the willingness of our volunteers and members to participate in the process of changing our city is paying off.  



I want to thank and acknowledge fellow Steering Committee Members, Angelica, Barbara and Kim for attending tonights hearing and thank the general membership for their continued support of San Franciscos Late Night Culture.

 Respectfully,

Terrance Alan
Chairperson

doesn't get too butt-hurt...

I'm thinking they believe that if it's "quoted", it streses the importance 
better than having it underlined?

Feel Like Dancing?
Beware of Tom Daschle.

By Dave Kopel & Glenn Reynolds



When John Ashcroft was nominated for attorney general, his political=20
enemies spent a lot of time mocking him for belonging to a denomination=20
that does not allow its members to engage in dancing. Since taking office,=
=20
Mr. Ashcroft has done absolutely nothing to infringe upon the rights of=20
people who like to dance. Tom Daschle, however, is now pushing legislation=
=20
that could send dance promoters to federal prison for up to 20 years.=20
Daschle's anti-dancing legislation is a mean-spirited assault on youth=20
culture, and an extreme violation of principles of federalism.

Last year, there was a big push in Congress to enact the so-called "RAVE=20
Act," sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith (D., Tex.) as H.R. 5519 and in the=20
Senate by Joseph Biden (D., Del.). Both lead sponsors were very forthright;=
=20
the very title of the bill announced its intention to go after "raves" =97=
=20
dance parties popular with Generations X and Y.

But the "RAVE Act" aroused enormous opposition, so much so that the Senate=
=20
Judiciary chairman withdrew his co-sponsorship of the bill.

This year, the same act is back; but this time it's concealed deep within=20
an immense, omnibus bill sponsored by Tom Daschle =97 the so-called "Justice=
=20
Enhancement and Domestic Security Act of 2003" (S. 22). That Act includes=20
some antiterrorist measures which are important and which ought to be=20
debated in separate bills (for instance, authorizing military tribunals for=
=20
al Qaeda warriors).

But S. 22 is also larded with numerous anti-civil-liberties proposals,=20
including ballistics testing for all new firearms, and anti-gun-show=20
language making gun shows presumptively illegal except when authorized by=20
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Daschle's S. 22 is the=20
contemporary version of the 1994 Clinton crime bill, a bloviated monster=20
that was far too large for either Congress or citizens to be able to=20
understand its contents.

And the "RAVE Act" reappears too =97 only this time, the word "RAVE" never=
=20
appears in a title. Rather, the "RAVE Act" language is found in sections=20
5131-36, under the misleading title "Crack House Statute Amendments."

The Daschle bill extends the federal "crackhouse law" =97 which makes it=20
illegal to maintain a building for purposes of drug consumption =97 to cover=
=20
musical performances and other events of a temporary nature, and to make=20
liable even those who make their premises available at no charge. The idea=
=20
is to make the promoters of musical events liable for drug consumption at=20
those events =97 even when the consumption is entirely incidental, and has=
=20
nothing to do with any action by the promoters. The legislation is, in=20
effect, an admission of failure by the Drug Enforcement Agency: Unable to=20
control drug use, it's looking to force concert promoters and theaters to=20
do it, on pain of imprisonment.

As amended by Daschle, the "crackhouse law" would make it a 20-year federal=
=20
felony to "manage or control any place, whether permanently or temporarily,=
=20
either as an owner, lessee, agent, employee, occupant, or mortgagee, and=20
knowingly and intentionally rent, lease, profit from, or make available for=
=20
use, with or without compensation, the place for the purpose of unlawfully=
=20
manufacturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance."

This language is broad enough to encompass not only rave promoters and disc=
=20
jockeys, but also bar owners, hotel or motel owners, concert promoters,=20
tour bus or cruise ship operators =97 and even home owners. Literally read,=
=20
the statute would even apply to a homeowner whose teenagers occasionally=20
smoked marijuana on the property.

The existing track record of the "crackhouse law" offers no reason to be=20
confident that overzealous prosecutors will not push the law to the extreme=
=20
limits of its language. As we detailed in a previous column, the then-U.S.=
=20
attorney of New Orleans brought felony "crackhouse" charges against the=20
owners of the historic State Palace Theater. Jordan argued that the sale on=
=20
the premises of "drug paraphernalia," such as glowsticks and even bottled=20
water, was somehow evidence that the owners were colluding in drug=20
consumption at dance parties.

But in truth, those who use drugs, or sell drugs, at raves and concerts are=
=20
responsible for their own actions, and it makes no more sense to blame the=
=20
concert promoter, or the owner of the hall, for their activities than it=20
does to blame the owner of a hotel in whose convention center illegal=20
campaign donations are made for campaign fraud. Nor does it make sense to=20
blame cruise-ship operators or homeowners.

The word "rave" appears nowhere in the criminal language, but shows up only=
=20
in section 5136 (still under the "crackhouse" title), which authorizes the=
=20
Drug Enforcement Administration to be appropriated more tax dollars "to=20
educate youth, parents, and other interested adults about the drugs=20
associated with raves."

Most of the Daschle bill =97 including his misnamed "crackhouse" amendments,=
=20
as well as the current crackhouse law =97 is a gross abrogation of=20
federalism. If people operate facilities that lure drug users in=20
disproportionate numbers, the traditional remedy is a public nuisance=20
action, brought by the local district attorney in state court.

The crackhouse law and the Daschle extension replace that remedy =97 which=
=20
has been considered adequate for well over a century =97 with an extremely=
=20
harsh federal criminal statute. This isn't because local authorities have=20
been complaining that the problem has interstate dimensions that elude=20
them. Indeed, drug use =97 at a concert, or in a bar, or in a home =97 is by=
=20
its nature a very local activity. This isn't a statute about interstate=20
drug sales, but about local drug use or possession.

Frustrated by the failure to reduce Ecstasy use, federal bureaucrats and=20
their congressional allies are now looking to attack easy-to-find public=20
targets. Some have even admitted that their real target isn't drugs per se,=
=20
but rather the "rave culture" =97 even though some earlier efforts at=20
prosecuting rave promoters have been enjoined
http://www.emdef.org/cases/nola_StatePalace/nola_plea_injunction.pdf
on First Amendment grounds.

This legislation is the latest stage of mission creep for federal law=20
enforcement, aided and abetted by members of Congress who should know=20
better. As the Musician's Guide to Drug Policy Reform observes,=20
empire-building federal bureaucrats have been whipping up culture-war=20
hysteria against musicians ever since Henry Alsinger blamed "swing" music=20
(and its practitioners, such as Glenn Miller) for marijuana use.

Under a federal system, it is supposed to be state and local governments,=20
and not the federal government, that deal with matters of local law=20
enforcement. There's nothing in the Constitution authorizing the federal=20
government to waste taxpayer money "educating" the public about the dangers=
=20
of swing music, rave music, or any other form of music.

We are continually reminded, as a justification for restrictions on civil=20
liberties, that we are at war. But, precisely because we are at war, we=20
cannot afford to have the Justice Department and federal law-enforcement=20
authorities wasting their time on the kind of trivia represented by much of=
=20
S. 22, including the misnamed "crackhouse" provision. The Constitution=20
gives Congress and the federal government the duty to provide for the=20

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Failing Anti-terror Campaign: Afghani Drug Flow Unchanged

Last I checked we didn't go into Afghanistan in order to curtail their drug
trade, we went in to find Bin Laden and to remove the Taliban from power.
This is a damned if we do damned if we don't situation.  If the article
reported that we had begun a massive campaign to eliminate the drug trade in
Afghanistan, you'd be writing that good ol' W was using the war on terrorism
as an excuse to further the drug war.  Further I'd probably be reading posts
about how we had mistakenly burned down the fields of poor Afghani farmers
because we mistakenly believed them to be drug traffikers.

The headline would be "US. Forces burn wrong fields, accidentally kill 5
innocents"

Followed by ten posts about how we had no business burning the fields in the
first place, and how our soldiers should be looking for Bin Laden and not
wasting time on our immoral and irresponsible drug war.

Not to mention what is wrong with Russia that they can't just do this
themself?  I don't think we or anyone else are gonna complain if they decide
to bring in a few troops to wipe out some poppy fields and production sites.

At what point does self loathing become unhealthy?

Just Curious,

Really?  Well I admit I'd heard that before somewhere, but then it seems
like we have a bit of a contradiction.

The original article that started this thread said this.

"border guards stationed in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan,
bordering Afghanistan, had prevented about 90 drug smuggling attempts,
detained 65 illegal border crossers, and seized more than 4 tons of illegal
drugs last year, however these have minor impact on the massive market."

Massive Market?

Hmm, well if they did all that last year, then the "massive market" it only
had a "minor impact on" must also have existed last year.

If the Massive Market existed last year, then it sure must have existed
before we ever removed the Taliban from power, cause massive markets don't
just spring up in a few months, and neither do poppy fields.

Not to mention the article didn't exactly make it sound as if the issue of
drug trafficking out of Afghanistan was a new one for Russia.

"According to Russia's Border Guard Service, the US-led anti-terror
operation in Afghanistan has done nothing to reduce the flow of illegal
drugs."

It sounds to me like there must have already been a flow of drugs before we
got there, else what would there have been for us to reduce?

Call for Large Sculpture

We are looking for LARGE pieces of sculpture to place in front of a club
named 1015 Folsom on Feb. 13th, 2003. This is a Thursday.

The address of the club is the same as the name.

The event is Ascension and it includes performance, video art, fine art, 
and
music.

Outside the club, visuals will be projected onto the side of the building
and we'd like to have large pieces of sculpture on display too. It's not
very often that you can display your sculpture all night on a sidewalk in
San Francisco.

You would need to deliver it on the 13th and remove it after the event at 3
a.m. or at 2 a.m. would be okay too.

During the event, a security guard will be outside, but after the event, it
will be your responsibility to move it and protect it.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  Chinese Horoscope For the New Year

--=====================_10640521==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Tomorrow is the Chinese New Year.  The Year of the Ram in a Flock of Ewes.

The notion of a ram in the middle of a flock of ewes, (male in the middle 
of many females) may appear to some to be a position of good fortune. 
However, much as this may have some benefit, it also means that this year 
is a year in which it is easy to be seen, and therefore behaviour must be 
appropriate if you are not to be noticed for the wrong reasons. It will 
certainly be a year when inappropriate behaviour will be far more 
noticeable, and open to challenge.

The Ram is the most mild mannered of all of the Chinese zodiac animals, and 
can be prone to a little nervousness. The ram is an animal that avoids 
confrontation whenever possible, and a quiet life is always preferred to 
any other kind.

The direction with which the Ram is associated is not north, south, east or 
west, but the Chinese fifth direction, (not used in the West) - central. 
This centrality is perhaps indicative of the Ram's desire for peace and 
tranquillity, and the avoidance of taking sides. Though not taking sides 
may be advantageous at times, it may also be perceived as a lack of support 
for the position held by others, and as such may make for criticism or 
unsettling times.

This trait may be exacerbated by the Ram's paradoxically sharp tongue. 
Rarely used in malice, it is often a result of thoughtlessness. It is wise, 
therefore, in this year to think carefully about what one says, but 
equally, to try to see beyond the words people actually use, and to 
understand the motivation behind what is said. Without taking that extra 
care, confusion may arise, and this may lead to conflict.

ON THE FIRST day of Lunar New Year, after 1.30am to be exact, find a yellow
bag, walk north-west and buy something - anything - to put in it. Once the
mission has been accomplished, head home and go to bed, placing the
knotted bag on your pillow above your head. This will bring good luck in the
Year of the Goat, advises Chinese astrologer Edwin Ma Lai-wah.

With good luck assured, try not to overindulge or splash out unnecessarily.

What your sign says:
RAT (born in 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996): Watch out for
obstacles in your love life. A third party may creep in if you neglect your
loved one. Although money won't be a problem, try not to over-indulge.

OX (1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997): Don't just work all the time -
lift your head and look at the world outside. Accept and welcome any changes,
but most importantly, have fun. Creative activities such as karaoke, acting
and ballroom dancing would help to soothe your worried mind.

TIGER (1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998): A great year for love:
marriageis on the cards for singles and children for couples. When not
working, try some adventurous activities and competitive sports to fulfill
your need to be challenged. Be careful with money.

RABBIT (1939, 1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999): Expect a tumultuous love
life- try to enjoy the lows as well as the highs. Speak up and be frank with
your partner. To relax, stick with quieter forms of entertainment, such as
going to the movies and reading books, to prevent any further aggravation to
your already troubled mind.

DRAGON (1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000): Try not to think too much
and stop banging your head against a brick wall. This is a wonderful year
for love - don't run away from it. Go to lots of parties, meet new people
and travel. It's a year for fun, so don't just sit at home.

SNAKE (1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001): Although patience is a
virtue, wait no longer - this year is a good one for setting plans in action.
You will do well financially and share the fruits of your hard work with a
loved one - so be romantic and happy together.

HORSE (1930, 1942, 1954, 1966, 1978, 1990, 2002): Even though you may
not feel like going out, try to get away once in a while. Go for a hike, get
some fresh air. Expect a year of obstacles and opposition. Know thy
enemy a useful activity would be people-watching in shopping centres and
cafes.

GOAT (1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003): Your partner will be in
the mood to go out, splash out and have fun. Join in. Don't expect too much
to happen this year. Just go with the flow, and don't put too much pressure
on yourself to do well.

MONKEY (1932, 1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992): With the help of a lucky
star illuminating your path, you should do well financially. Although you may
yearn to be alone, try to be sociable. Expect arguments in
relationships, though they should not be too damaging.

ROOSTER (1933, 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993): There will be endless
social obligations - try to avoid unnecessary ones. Stay clear of places of
sexual temptation, such as girlie bars and hostess clubs. If you invest wisely
and patiently and are not over-confident, this should be a prosperous year.

DOG (1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994): This is a good year for going
to art galleries and theatres, but stay clear of noisy functions and
unnecessary challenges. In relationships, an old partner may leave and a
new one could appear. Try not to swim against the tide and accept that this
is not your year. Wear something light yellow to ward off bad luck.

PIG (1935, 1947, 1959, 1971, 1983, 1995): Leave plenty of room for
manoeuvre in every aspect of your life. You are bound to overspend so try to
cut back: don't always eat out, and rent movies instead of going to the
cinema. You will be the source of arguments in relationships, so try to
control your temper.

Call for Large Sculpture

We are looking for LARGE pieces of sculpture to place in front of a club
named 1015 Folsom on Feb. 13th, 2003. This is a Thursday.

The address of the club is the same as the name.

The event is Ascension and it includes performance, video art, fine art,
and
music.

Outside the club, visuals will be projected onto the side of the building
and we'd like to have large pieces of sculpture on display too. It's not
very often that you can display your sculpture all night on a sidewalk in
San Francisco.

You would need to deliver it on the 13th and remove it after the event at 3
a.m. or at 2 a.m. would be okay too.

During the event, a security guard will be outside, but after the event, it
will be your responsibility to move it and protect it.

Please email me: kcascension@yahoo.com

Subject: [sfraves] intro- DJ Baby Daddy, SF's original Ghettotech pimp

yo!

I've been kicking it here in SF for years now,
mixing records at house parties, clubs, 
even a couple times at Burningman 
and anyway- its long overdue that 
I chimed in on this list.

My style is to take dope shit from all 
different genres and see how fresh
I can combine them in the mix. 
A good example is ghettotech.  

For those who might not be familiar, 
its a style where the DJ will throw in 
booty tracks with jungle, electro, hip hop, 
sped up house or techno - whatever.

if you're still like, "whuhhh?"
just hit this link--> http://ghettoblasta.net

ALSO-
come check out my weekly- "Ghett Set" 
every friday night from 7-10 at Skylark,
on 16th and Valencia in the Mission, SF.  

At this gig, I focus on hip hop - new and old 
- radio and underground - but I mash it up wid
idm, jungle, funky house, hard house, electro, 
breakbeats, techno, disco and ol skool funk.

alrighty...nice to tap into the forum.
if you dig on ghettotech, or if you just a freak,
or just any one whose seen me around, plz drop a line-
babydaddy@ghettoblasta.net

peace!
Rob

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR:  Chinese Horoscope For the New Year

My late, great Dad, and my Bro are both Rams, tho' my mom, who is also a
Dragon, (just like me), always called them Sheep.

Typical.

One of my lifetime dreams/goals is to assemble a Harem for myself, and who
knows, being that the just passed Year of the Horse, which has the
attributes of being the year of Energy, Enterprise and Action, and given
that, as of the tail end of it, I re-joined the ranks of sole
proprietor/self employed, well let me just say that I'm looking forward to
the coming year.

Given that i've just moved to DC and found the truth of what I previously
considered to be a vicious canard, that the women here, as a whole are
absolutely stunning, is no canard, but the God's Honest Truth, my heart goes
pitter-pat at least a bunch of times a day, and that's just on my in in the
morning, let me just say, I'm really looking forward to this approaching
Spring.

the description of the Ram suits both my Dad and Brother, so if you're
feeling dismissive, check your premises.

Thanks Apollo, I've always paid attention to the Chinese side of the
astrology thing and this is pretty comprehensive, I've forwarded out to a
bunch of folk today.

Love,

nic

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Chinese Horoscope For the New Year


Tomorrow is the Chinese New Year.  The Year of the Ram in a Flock of Ewes.

The notion of a ram in the middle of a flock of ewes, (male in the middle
of many females) may appear to some to be a position of good fortune.
However, much as this may have some benefit, it also means that this year
is a year in which it is easy to be seen, and therefore behaviour must be
appropriate if you are not to be noticed for the wrong reasons. It will
certainly be a year when inappropriate behaviour will be far more
noticeable, and open to challenge.

The Ram is the most mild mannered of all of the Chinese zodiac animals, and
can be prone to a little nervousness. The ram is an animal that avoids
confrontation whenever possible, and a quiet life is always preferred to
any other kind.

The direction with which the Ram is associated is not north, south, east or
west, but the Chinese fifth direction, (not used in the West) - central.
This centrality is perhaps indicative of the Ram's desire for peace and
tranquillity, and the avoidance of taking sides. Though not taking sides
may be advantageous at times, it may also be perceived as a lack of support
for the position held by others, and as such may make for criticism or
unsettling times.

This trait may be exacerbated by the Ram's paradoxically sharp tongue.
Rarely used in malice, it is often a result of thoughtlessness. It is wise,
therefore, in this year to think carefully about what one says, but
equally, to try to see beyond the words people actually use, and to
understand the motivation behind what is said. Without taking that extra
care, confusion may arise, and this may lead to conflict.

ON THE FIRST day of Lunar New Year, after 1.30am to be exact, find a yellow
bag, walk north-west and buy something - anything - to put in it. Once the
mission has been accomplished, head home and go to bed, placing the
knotted bag on your pillow above your head. This will bring good luck in the
Year of the Goat, advises Chinese astrologer Edwin Ma Lai-wah.

With good luck assured, try not to overindulge or splash out unnecessarily.

What your sign says:
RAT (born in 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996): Watch out for
obstacles in your love life. A third party may creep in if you neglect your
loved one. Although money won't be a problem, try not to over-indulge.

OX (1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997): Don't just work all the time -
lift your head and look at the world outside. Accept and welcome any
changes,
but most importantly, have fun. Creative activities such as karaoke, acting
and ballroom dancing would help to soothe your worried mind.

TIGER (1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998): A great year for love:
marriageis on the cards for singles and children for couples. When not
working, try some adventurous activities and competitive sports to fulfill
your need to be challenged. Be careful with money.

RABBIT (1939, 1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999): Expect a tumultuous love
life- try to enjoy the lows as well as the highs. Speak up and be frank with
your partner. To relax, stick with quieter forms of entertainment, such as
going to the movies and reading books, to prevent any further aggravation to
your already troubled mind.

DRAGON (1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000): Try not to think too much
and stop banging your head against a brick wall. This is a wonderful year
for love - don't run away from it. Go to lots of parties, meet new people
and travel. It's a year for fun, so don't just sit at home.

SNAKE (1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001): Although patience is a
virtue, wait no longer - this year is a good one for setting plans in
action.
You will do well financially and share the fruits of your hard work with a
loved one - so be romantic and happy together.

HORSE (1930, 1942, 1954, 1966, 1978, 1990, 2002): Even though you may
not feel like going out, try to get away once in a while. Go for a hike, get
some fresh air. Expect a year of obstacles and opposition. Know thy
enemy a useful activity would be people-watching in shopping centres and
cafes.

GOAT (1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003): Your partner will be in
the mood to go out, splash out and have fun. Join in. Don't expect too much
to happen this year. Just go with the flow, and don't put too much pressure
on yourself to do well.

MONKEY (1932, 1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992): With the help of a lucky
star illuminating your path, you should do well financially. Although you
may
yearn to be alone, try to be sociable. Expect arguments in
relationships, though they should not be too damaging.

ROOSTER (1933, 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993): There will be endless
social obligations - try to avoid unnecessary ones. Stay clear of places of
sexual temptation, such as girlie bars and hostess clubs. If you invest
wisely
and patiently and are not over-confident, this should be a prosperous year.

DOG (1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994): This is a good year for going
to art galleries and theatres, but stay clear of noisy functions and
unnecessary challenges. In relationships, an old partner may leave and a
new one could appear. Try not to swim against the tide and accept that this
is not your year. Wear something light yellow to ward off bad luck.

PIG (1935, 1947, 1959, 1971, 1983, 1995): Leave plenty of room for
manoeuvre in every aspect of your life. You are bound to overspend so try to
cut back: don't always eat out, and rent movies instead of going to the
cinema. You will be the source of arguments in relationships, so try to
control your temper.
